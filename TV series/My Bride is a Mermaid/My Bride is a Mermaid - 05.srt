Hey, what exactly do you think
you're doing sittin' there?

156
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,125
[NAGASUMI] Well, sir.

157
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,833
I'm just sitting where my
desk has always been, sir.

158
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,250
[GOZABURO] So, maggot,
nothing's changed.

159
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,583
You're still a
smart-aleck, I see.

160
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,500
[NAGASUMI] And you seem
to be in fine health as well,

161
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,458
don't you sir?

162
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,666
[NAGASUMI]
The bell's ringing, sir.

163
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,916
The opening convocation
is about to start.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Do you wanna keep going?

165
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,958
Nagasumi, do you
know Mr. Seto?

166
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,333
Sun, can you please
explain this to me?

167
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,458
Well, Nagasumi...

168
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,625
It looks like Dad
became a teacher at

169
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,375
this school so he
can keep an eye on us.

170
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,125
[NAGASUMI] That means
he'll do whatever he can

171
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,916
to make sure
we're never alone!

172
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,000
Whoops,
I forgot something.

173
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,416
He'll need help.

174
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,250
[NAGASUMI] Excuse me.

175
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,125
[REN] Oh my,
what happened to him?

176
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,166
Our teacher sent him
flying across the room.

177
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,791
I think he's bruised
up pretty badly.

178
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,416
[REN] That does sound serious.

179
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,791
[REN] Nagasumi, get him into
that bed as quickly as possible.

180
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,791
[NAGASUMI] Uh-huh.

181
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,208
[NAGASUMI THINKS] How does
she know my name?

182
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,000
You're lookin' well.
Nice to see ya again.

183
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,875
Hey, wait a second,
you're Sun's mom!

184
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,666
Ya just dropped your
little monkey-like friend.

185
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,541
Is he gonna be alright?

186
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,958
This is great!

187
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,416
I thought it was just gonna be
her dad spying on me,

188
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,541
but now her mom's here
in some doctor coat!

189
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,541
Oh, do ya like it?
Thanks, that's sweet.

190
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,750
I must say, my husband
didn't care much for it.

191
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,541
I wasn't trying
to say anything like that!

192
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,625
I just meant that this is all
getting absolutely crazy!

193
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,125
[REN] Yes, you may be right.

194
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,291
Perhaps it is a bit crazy
to call in a favor with the

195
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,916
Ministry of Education in order
to work as school personnel.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,791
[REN] But you know
what, Nagasumi?

197
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,875
Sometimes just
goin' a little bit crazy

198
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,041
can make life a whole
lot more interestin'.

199
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,833
[NAGASUMI] So what
are you doing here?

200
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,666
[REN] Now that ya
know about us mermaids

201
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,125
and you and Sun are engaged,

202
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,375
you need to become
one of us, don't ya think?

203
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,750
[REN] And if you don't think
our little Sun is enough for ya.

204
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,083
Perhaps I could make
you into my own kept man.

205
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,666
[NAGASUMI]
What are you talking about?

206
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,125
I need to get out of here!
Excuse me! I gotta go!

207
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,041
[REN] He's so cute!

208
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,875
[NAGASUMI] I can't
believe Sun's mom

209
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,000
has actually shown up here too!

210
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,500
This isn't even remotely funny!

211
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,916
But she did look really nice and
she smelled so very sweet.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,250
No, Nagasumi!
Stop it right now.

213
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,791
This is crazy!

214
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,791
Damn it, these people are
really trying to ruin my life!

215
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,833
Why can't...

216
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,541
Wait just a second.
Is that--?

217
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,625
[NAGASUMI] It's Masa!

218
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,333
That's right...
I'm glad to see that

219
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,291
--[VOICES] ...a fated reunion.
--you're still hangin' in there.

220
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,791
I've come to assume a new
position as a math teacher, see.

221
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,166
So I'm sure I'll,
see you around.

222
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,791
Yes.
I'm sure we will--

223
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,333
No, what I really
wanted to say was,

224
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,916
how many of the Seto gang have
come to this school, anyway?

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,083
This ain't good.
That bastard Nakajima really

226
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,000
screwed up his
anthropomorphosis.

227
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,625
Nakajima?

228
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,375
[NAGASUMI] Yeah...
He's really messed this one up,

229
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,791
and it looks like one of
his legs has been cut, too.

230
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,958
Well at least the opening

231
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,583
convocation's already
gotten under way.

232
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,708
Lucky for you guys.

233
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,125
Of course right now
I'm just surprised

234
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,541
that you all haven't
been found out already.

235
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,083
[SHARK] Oh, if it
isn't Nagasumi?

236
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,333
Idiot!

237
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,458
Why the hell you bitin'
at him, Shark Fujishiro?

238
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,083
[NAGASUMI] Wait,
he said "Shark Fujishiro."

239
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,250
Does he mean--?

240
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,541
[SHARK] Haven't you
figured it out yet?

241
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,750
If this human dies,

242
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,541
then we all get to go
home to Seto, right?

243
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
So we really don't
need to worry, huh?

244
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,416
[SHARK] I won't leave
a shred behind?

245
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,625
[SHARK] I'm the PE teacher,
Shark Fujishiro?

246
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,250
I look forward to
teaching you, Nagasumi?

247
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,416
[NAGASUMI] Well, I don't!

248
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
[SHARK] The convocation's
already started?

249
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,791
I'll kill you while there
aren't any witnesses?

250
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,541
[NAGASUMI] This is seriously
getting worse by the second!

251
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,625
Half the teachers are
from the Seto syndicate.

252
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,416
Not good!

253
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,083
[SUN] Stop it, Fujishiro!

254
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,583
[NAGASUMI]
Oh, hey, Sun, thank you!

255
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,666
Oh that was
Howling Voice,

256
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,000
it's a mermaid techniques.

257
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,375
I wanna know what
exactly's goin' on here.

258
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,541
I went to check
on you in the

259
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,750
nurse's office,
and my mom was there.

260
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,625
[REN] Ya sure found
us out quickly, dear.

261
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,041
[SUN] And Dad's workin' here
as my homeroom teacher.

262
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,500
[GOZABURO] What's all
the fuss about over here?

263
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,041
[SUN] And Masa's here and
Fujishiro and Nakajima!

264
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,291
And then when
I opened my bag

265
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,166
I saw that Maki'd come
along with me too.

266
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,041
[NAGASUMI] So that
creature is here too?

267
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,083
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
This is unbelievable!

268
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,833
These people are going too far!

269
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,000
They're completely
taking over my school!

270
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,250
I've had it with them!

271
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,750
Sun needs to give 'em
all a good talking to!

272
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,750
Now, all of ya all of ya.
Ya have my utmost thanks!

273
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,833
[SUN] I'm so lucky to
have this many people

274
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,125
looking after me and
worryin' about me.

275
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,708
[NAGASUMI] And so
the Seto gang turned

276
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,500
up to look after their dear Sun.

277
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,000
They showed up in full force.
That's how my school year began.

278
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,375
[GOZABURO] We'll always be
watching over her, don't ya see?

279
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,208
[Nagasumi crying]

280
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,958
[NAGASUMI] It's horrible!

281
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,083
I can't believe it!
How could Sun's dad actually be

282
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,000
posing as a new
teacher at my school?

283
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,000
Now I'm going to have to see
his ugly face every single day!

284
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,541
[NAGASUMI] Sun, I don't know if
I want to go to school anymore!

285
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,166
[NAGASUMI] Oh it's Sun.
Sun's right there smiling at me!

286
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,041
[NAGASUMI] Sun!

287
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,083
[MASA] Oh, you on your
way home, Nagasumi?

288
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,250
[NAGASUMI] I know
that voice! It's Masa!

289
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,791
[NAGASUMI]
What fantastic timing.

290
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,333
I feel so lost right now.

291
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,958
Maybe I'll just give up and
leave everything in his hands.

292
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,541
[MASA] What are
you talking about now?

293
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,333
[NAGASUMI] At this point,
I honestly have no idea.

294
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,041
[MASA] So that's it, then?

295
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,625
The boss's paternal
affection for

296
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,250
Miss Sun is grindin' ya down?

297
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,791
[NAGASUMI] That's about it.

298
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,041
I mean, he did become a teacher
in order to come after her.

299
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,583
That just isn't normal.

300
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,583
And are you all
right with this?

301
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,208
Of course I'm not all right!

302
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,416
No, that isn't
what I meant.

303
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,083
What I was asking was,

304
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,041
if you're ready to
forfeit this battle.

305
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,166
Are you willing to accept
that you may care

306
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,083
for Sun less than
her father cares for her?

307
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,458
[NAGASUMI] Masa.

308
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,416
[NAGASUMI] You're right.
I can't lose this battle.

309
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,208
Sun's already
sacrificed too much

310
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,708
for me to give up like that.

311
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,083
I'm going home now, Masa.
I'll see you tomorrow at school!

312
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,125
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I'll
show Sun I care for her

313
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,500
as much as her dad does.

314
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,166
No, even better,
I'll become a man

315
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,333
who she'll really fall for.

316
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,541
[NAGASUMI] I'm gonna
give this my all!

317
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,958
[SARU] Sun! Are you ready?

318
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,458
[SARU] Let's get going!

319
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,791
So you're not here to walk
to school with me, then, huh?

320
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,875
Well, that kick of yours
wasn't half bad, Nagasumi.

321
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,458
But would you like to explain
why you're attacking me?

322
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,125
Listen very closely
to me, Chimp.

323
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
Sun is a special person,

324
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
and she is extremely
important to me.

325
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,416
I owe her my life.

326
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,083
No one can care about
her as much as I do.

327
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,041
You get me?

328
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,708
Oh yeah.
I get you.

329
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,500
Then you'd better make
sure you stay away!

330
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
What's with the threatening
and yelling all of a sudden?

331
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,500
[NAGASUMI] I've decided to live
a macho life, starting today.

332
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,916
You can just go live
in the mountains

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,666
like the chimp you are!

334
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,708
So you're suddenly
macho, are you?

335
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,958
Sure am.

336
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,750
[SARU] Then let me ask
you something, Nagasumi.

337
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,791
What's that sticking
out of your bag?

338
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,750
[SARU] Because it sure
looks like a doll to me!

339
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,125
[NAGASUMI] Maki!
What're you doing?

340
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,250
You know you're not supposed
to let humans see you!

341
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,666
[MAKI] Isn't it
obvious, sea louse?

342
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,666
I'm pretendin' ta be a doll.

343
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,083
Don't ya think that
getting' so worked

344
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,708
up talkin' to a doll
like this makes ya

345
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,125
look a little crazy, though?

346
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,125
Nagasumi, I don't
know what happened

347
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,583
to you over summer vacation,

348
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,166
but I can't believe that
you're into dolls now!

349
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,166
[NAGASUMI] N-n-n-no, wait!

350
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,541
[SARU] Well good luck to you.

351
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
Hope you enjoy the rest
of your life with your doll.

352
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,416
You're wrecking my new
macho life in the first minute!

353
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,041
[MAKI] Yeah, you can
handle that yourself.

354
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,541
Dammit,
I'm not going to lose!

355
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,500
I'll beat her dad and make
him acknowledge me as

356
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,583
a man if it's the last

357
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,791
--[SUN] Mornin'!
--thing I do in my life!

358
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,916
The road to manhood
is a difficult one!

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,708
[MAKI] Whatever,
just go to school.

360
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,791
Okay, since all of ya
brats are new to me.

361
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,500
We're gonna start off
with a kanji test right now.

362
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,750
Are ya ready, huh?

363
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,416
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I'm pretty good at Kanji tests.

364
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,791
This is my chance
to impress her dad!

365
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,333
[NAGASUMI] All right, Sun!
Watch this!

366
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,666
[SUN]
'Kay.

367
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,666
[GOZABURO] Okay, it's time
to check your answers.

368
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,333
First up. Code of honor.

369
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,833
The next
one is a bit tougher:

370
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,500
"Manly chivalry." The next
one is written "territory,"--

371
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,750
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
This is ridiculous.

372
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,791
I'm gonna forget
about impressing him.

373
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,541
[MASA] Listen up,
this'll be on the test.

374
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,000
If your monthly
action from Territory A,

375
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,375
newly controlled by you,
is two parts tribute money,

376
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,708
two parts rent, and three
parts protection money,

377
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,916
and you want to make
ten mil a month--

378
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,791
Mr. Masa's lectures are
so easy to understand!

379
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,208
They ARE, but
somehow I feel I

380
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,291
shouldn't get too deeply
involved in the subject matter.

381
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,375
Tell me this is not
what I'm thinking!

382
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,750
So far there have been
no opportunities to show off.

383
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,375
[SARU] Psst, Nagasumi!
Over here!

384
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,125
[NAGASUMI] Hmm? Chimp,
what are you doing there?

385
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,125
You'll get yelled at for
going out there, you know.

386
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,666
Never mind, come on.

387
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,791
You see. It's
a perfect view.

388
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,041
From here you can peep at all

389
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,333
the girls while
they're changing.

390
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,625
Hey no, Chimp, there
will be no peeping!

391
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,125
[SARU] What the heck, Nagasumi?

392
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,416
I thought you were going to
act like a man from now on!

393
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,791
[NAGASUMI] Like a man?

394
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,208
Hey, this is acting
like an animal,

395
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,625
not acting like a man!

396
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,958
Not that I'm entirely
uninterested in it.

397
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,375
Just get over
it, Nagasumi.

398
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,541
While girls are changing,
boys are peeping at them.

399
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,166
That's how it is.

400
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,333
In what country
is that the way it is?

401
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,000
[SARU] Nagasumi,
just think about it a minute!

402
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,625
If they didn't want us
to peep, why would they

403
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,375
be changing behind
one measly curtain!

404
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,291
The girls actually want us to
look at them, don't you see?!

405
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,916
No! No,
is that really true?

406
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,458
You won't fool me like that.

407
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm not that stupid,
monkey balls.

408
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,250
Why don't we
be honest with

409
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,166
ourselves for a
minute, Nagasumi?

410
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
On the other
side of that curtain,

411
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,375
paradise is waiting for us.

412
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,416
What are you saying, exactly?

413
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,291
[NAGASUMI] Pa-Paradise?

414
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,458
What do ya say, kid?

415
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't you wanna
find happiness together?

416
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,083
It'll feel real nice,
I promise you that.

417
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,458
[NAGASUMI] Happiness?

418
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,166
We could find happiness
in that shining paradise!

419
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,208
No, no, no, no.

420
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,541
If I'm not careful,
I'll be dragged

421
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,208
into Old Man
Chimp's letchosphere!

422
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,958
I will not lose this battle,
no matter what.

423
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,458
I am determined to live
a manly, macho life!

424
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
Damn, kid, you're
some kinda idiot.

425
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,958
Or is it that you're
more interested in

426
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,708
your little dolls than
in real live babes?

427
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,291
Is that it, little girl?

428
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,583
Don't make
fun of dolls, okay?

429
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,291
On second thought, drop
that subject completely!

430
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,583
[SHARK] Hey, you over there?

431
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,375
[SHARK] Who said
you could go out there?

432
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,958
Oh, no.
This is really bad.

433
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,458
Come on, Chimp.

434
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,500
[ANSWERING MACINE (SARU)]
I can't come to the phone now.

435
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,375
[NAGASUMI] Damn you,
Monkey Balls.

436
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,375
[SHARK] Well, well,
who is that? Is it Nagasumi?

437
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,250
[NAGASUMI] Oh no,
I recognize that speech pattern.

438
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,541
It's Shark Fujishiro!

439
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,791
No, I'm afraid that
name won't do here boy?

440
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,041
I'm the PE teacher
here, after all.

441
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,583
So it's Mr. Fujishiro to you.

442
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,875
He jumped up
to the second floor?

443
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,416
I'm so screwed.

444
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,458
This guy might actually be more
dangerous than Sun's father!

445
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,500
[SHARK] You're a
stupid boy, Nagasumi?

446
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,458
Letting me find you alone
in a deserted place like this?

447
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,625
You know what I'll do?
I'll eat you?

448
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,000
In under five seconds?

449
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,750
[SHARK] I'll bite off
your head and eat it?

450
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,666
[NAGASUMI] Just let
me go and I'll never eat

451
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,458
another bowl of shark
fin soup again, I swear!

452
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,708
Please!

453
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,666
Hey, is there something
going on out there?

454
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,583
This is bad!
I've hit a dead end!

455
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,916
[SHARK] Oh good!
Time for lu--

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,291
[NAGASUMI] I don't
want to be shark food!

457
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,791
How am I supposed
to get out of this?

458
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,000
I could dive into
that classroom.

459
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,958
But no, right now they're--Argh!

460
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,500
Sun, what do I do?

461
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,750
I don't want to be swallowed
whole by this man-eating shark!

462
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
It's all over now!
My life is over!

463
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,958
What was I supposed to do?

464
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,125
Arrest him!

465
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,500
Detain Nagasumi on
charges of molestation

466
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,333
and the public display of
obscene materials!

467
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,625
Do it now!
Now!

468
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,125
[GIRLS] Yeah, arrest him!
Arrest Nagasumi now!

469
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,291
[CLASS REP] Mawari, you should
at least put your shirt on.

470
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,833
[MAWARI] Well,
you've done it now.

471
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,458
You really crossed a
line today, Nagasumi.

472
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,708
[MAWARI] What could
you have been thinking,

473
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
barging into the girls'
changing room like that?

474
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,666
It was completely idiotic.

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,333
And I was in the
middle of changing

476
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,916
my clothes, I hope you know.

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,916
[MAWARI] Maybe
I should teach you

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,250
a lesson in the
rules of this society.

479
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,333
[NAGASUMI] Officer Mawari,
I understand that you

480
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:58,958
smoothed things
over with the teacher.

481
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,125
Thank you so much.

482
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
But, uh...
It's all my fault in the end.

483
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,333
It doesn't matter anymore.

484
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,000
A person like me has no right
even attempting to be macho.

485
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,875
[NAGASUMI] I can't
explain to her about Fujishiro.

486
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,458
I'll never tell anyone about
the secret of Sun's race.

487
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,666
She saved my life,
so I owe her that.

488
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,000
I hope that pervy
chimp dies, though.

489
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,541
[NAGASUMI]
What good is any of this?

490
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,875
Oh, Sun.

491
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,291
I don't want to go to school
anymore, I'm sorry!

492
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,250
[NAGASUMI] Oh its Sun!
Sun is smiling at me!

493
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,041
Just wait, I'll be right there!

494
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,791
[SUN] Did ya just call
my name, Nagasumi?

495
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,208
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Sun.

496
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
What are ya doin' out
here on the bridge all alone?

497
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,458
[NAGASUMI] Um, well.

498
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,875
[NAGASUMI THINKS] She told
she had some things to take

499
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,666
care of and I should
head home without her,

500
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,208
but she probably was just too

501
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,291
embarrassed to
walk home with me.

502
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,625
Now I've even
lost Sun's trust.

503
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,166
What are you doing, Nagasumi?

504
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,416
[SUN] I'm real sorry, Nagasumi.

505
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,208
I couldn't manage
to prove your innocence,

506
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,916
but I tried real hard,
I promise.

507
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,458
[SUN] I even asked Chimp
to help, but he wouldn't.

508
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,750
I swear on my honor I tried my
best to get you off the hook.

509
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,791
[SUN] In the end,

510
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,333
I guess I'm a
failure as a bride.

511
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,708
[SUN] Class Rep and
Officer Mawari were

512
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,083
eventually able to get
everybody under control.

513
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,041
[SUN] I was really sweatin' in
front of Officer Mawari though.

514
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,541
She makes me nervous.

515
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,208
Really, you can
just call her Mawari.

516
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,083
[SUN] But anyway,
everything's going

517
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,666
to be okay now, you'll see.

518
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,208
So then, you aren't...

519
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,458
You mean you aren't
mad at me or anything?

520
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,791
[SUN] What for?

521
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,125
Well after what I did,
I thought that you would be.

522
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,708
I'm sure that ya
had a reason, right?

523
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,500
I believe in ya, Nagasumi,
and today doesn't change that.

524
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,833
Ya see, if I didn't believe in
my husband, then it would

525
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,333
be a disgrace to all Seto
mermaids everywhere.

526
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,833
Ya see, because honor among

527
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,041
thieves' is
'honor under the seas.'

528
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,333
Thank you, Sun.

529
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,750
Understand now?

530
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,250
I'm yer bride,
Nagasumi, and there's

531
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,541
nothin' that's
gonna change that.

532
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:46,958
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I don't think my heart's

533
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,833
ever felt like this before.

534
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,208
An engagement that's merely

535
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,208
the product of the
law of the mermaids.

536
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,041
A love that doesn't come
until after the engagement.

537
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,583
But the feeling
I have right now has

538
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,916
nothing to do with
laws or sacrifices.

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,333
It's pure, and simple,
and quite real.

540
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,291
[SUN] Come on, let's go home.

541
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:11,250
[NAGASUMI] Yeah...

542
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,916
[NAGASUMI] Okay, Sun,

543
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,541
I think you understand
this already, but...

544
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,291
Right, our weddin'
is a secret.

545
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,791
I'll be careful not
to tell anyone,

546
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,375
so ya don't have to worry.

547
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

548
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,291
Let me in on all
the fun here, will ya?

549
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,291
Shut up, traitor!

550
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,375
Why don't you just
go eat a banana

551
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,625
like the pervy
chimp that you are?

552
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We are sorry, but ya
see, it's our little secret.

553
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:36,666
What?

554
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,833
[NAGASUMI] Right?

555
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,708
[SUN] Right!

556
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,750
They're in
their own world!

557
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,500
Why are they
alienating me like this?

558
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,875
[GOZABURO] A secret, huh?

559
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,916
Ya got a secret,
you little maggot?

560
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,333
That's no good Nagasumi,
no good at all ya fappy bastard!

561
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,333
Ya might wanna
rethink that, in fact!

562
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,291
[GOZABURO]
"Our little secret," my ass!

563
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,583
[NAGASUMI] So this is how
things are gonna end again?

564
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,666
[SUN] Dad, stop it!
Let him go!

565

♪

566
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,583
[NAGASUMI] It sure
seems that Mawari's

567
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,125
been lashing out a lot lately.

568
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,291
After Maki, I don't need any
more violent women in my life.

569
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,916
Huh?
Mawari's suspicious of Sun?

570
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,083
This is bad!
This is really bad!

fire technique:
Nagasumi Barrier.
