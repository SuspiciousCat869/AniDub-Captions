Nothing! It's nothing!

161
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's see it.

162
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,291
[kitty meows]

163
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,791
[Gozaburo screams]

164
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,625
[NAGASUMI]
It's just a cat.

165
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,583
[GOZABURO]
You're a bad boy, bringin'

166
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,291
a wild animal
to school, Nagasumi.

167
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,291
[NAGASUMI] Sorry.
You wanna confiscate it?

168
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,375
[GOZABURO]
Nah, no need for that.

169
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,125
[NAGASUMI] But teacher!
It's against the rules!

170
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,250
You should really take it!

171
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,166
[Nagasumi laughs]

172
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,500
So, as it turns out--

173
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,750
Sun's dad's still
terrified of kittens!

174
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,541
What? Mr. Seto? Really?
Hard to believe,

175
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,541
what with his "tough guy"
exterior and all.

176
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,833
Don't judge a
book by its cover.

177
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,625
[SUN] Nagasumi?

178
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, Sun! Come
on over, it's okay.

179
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,541
I promise I won't
let go of the cat.

180
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,958
Ya know.... Nagasumi,

181
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,333
I wish ya wouldn't
be so hard on Dad.

182
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,875
There's a real good reason
why he's still scared of cats.

183
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:29,541
There is?

184
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,041
[SUN] Yeah...

185
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,958
It's 'cause of somethin' that
happened when he was a kid.

186
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,000
Your dad as a kid.
That's hard to imagine.

187
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,000
[SUN] He told me he
was takin' a nap one day,

188
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,958
mindin' his own business,
when a cat came along.

189
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,708
[SUN] And it bit him on the ear!

190
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,166
And then his ear
got infected and

191
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
almost fell off,
or somethin'.

192
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,458
He's had a bad case
of cat-phobia ever since.

193
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,750
[NAGASUMI] Oh...

194
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,916
Alright! Everybody! Get to
yer seats. We're startin'.

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,250
[NAGASUMI] Well,
speak of the devil.

196
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,583
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
H-He's looking at me like

197
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,333
he wants to eat me alive!

198
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,500
Any other day, this would
be my cue to run for it.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,291
[NAGASUMI] But today--
I've got this little guy.

200
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,375
[kitty meows]

201
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,458
[GOZABURO] I'm the boss!
I never retreat! I never beg!

202
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,125
And I never look back!

203
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,458
What's wrong, boss?
Someone need whackin'?

204
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,291
[GOZABURO] Dammit.
The maggot's gone'n pissed

205
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,708
me off for the last time.

206
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,458
So this time, oh,
he'll see exactly what happens,

207
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,708
when you mess with me.

208
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,791
Let me do it!

209
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,416
I've just been
waitin' for an excuse

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,791
to teach that damn
sea louse a lesson!

211
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,500
Good. I'm callin' in my
elite guard to back ya' up.

212
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,583
But, boss...!

213
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,125
Using the elite guard?
Isn't that--?

214
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,583
[GOZABURO] Overkill.
An' they're all yours.

215
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
[GOZABURO] That
little shit thinks he's

216
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,958
a big man now, does he?

217
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
Thinks he can push me around?

218
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,875
Well if that's the game
he wants to play, fine!

219
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,291
Let's play!

220
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,041
It's my turn now--an'
I'm about to start pushin' back!

221
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,291
[SHARK] Listen up?

222
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,500
We have some
new students with us?

223
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,416
They're on temporary transfer
from Seto Junior High?

224
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,291
And starting immediately they'll
be joining the boys' gym class?

225
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,416
Transfer students
from Seto, huh?

226
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,041
I wanna do a
temporary transfer to

227
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,291
the girls' gym class
for the day! Can I?

228
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,625
[NAGASUMI] Shut it.

229
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,625
Before we get started,
come introduce yourselves?

230
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,083
I'm Maguro, here from
Seto Junior High, gyo.

231
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,541
I'm Ajitaro, gyo.

232
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm Burio, gyo.

233
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,333
[ALL] We hope we can
all be great friends, gyo!

234
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,791
[BURIO] My name is Burio, gyo!
I'm a master of surprise

235
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,791
tactics and disguise, gyo!

236
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,750
Only a brilliant
strategist like me can lead

237
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,250
this crack squad of
battle-hardened commandos!

238
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,333
Never say die, gyo!

239
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,333
I'm Ajitaro, gyo!

240
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,458
I'm a whiz at
information gathering!

241
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,625
Using internet auctions,

242
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,125
I can get you anything at all,

243
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,625
from limited-edition DVD's
to collectible figurines, gyo!

244
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,166
[MAGURO] And last
but not least...

245
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm Maguro, gyo!

246
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,916
My red flesh is
light yet flavorful,

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,291
making me a popular
guy at dinnertime,

248
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,666
perfect for sushi
and sashimi, gyo!

249
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,375
But please, just don't
overfish me, okay?

250
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,875
[BURIO] Together--we
scare the tears

251
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,375
right out of crying children!

252
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,500
We are the elusive elite guard
of Gozaburo Seto himself!

253
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,666
We are--!

254
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,166
The Branchial
Respiration Brothers!

255
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
[MAGURO] What sort of
trouble will we stir up next?

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,958
Tune in to find out!

257
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,500
Everybody, let's give
them a warm welcome, okay?

258
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS] These
guys are definitely merfolk!

259
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,291
What are they after?
Attention?

260
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,000
Anyway, they suck big
time at looking like humans!

261
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,500
Today we'll be playing
a friendly soccer match?

262
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,708
We'll split into two teams,
White and Red?

263
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,333
Gyo, gyo, gyo...

264
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,541
Seriously man, can't you
do something about that outfit?

265
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,250
[KAI] How am I s'posed
ta endure a bright,

266
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,666
wide-open place
without this?

267
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,458
How 'bout you just stick
to the sidelines on this one.

268
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,750
[KAI] You wish!

269
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,708
Anything you can do,
I can do ten times as well!

270
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,833
[Kai laughs]

271
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,166
[SHARK] And begin?

272
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,041
Is this what
you wanted, Maki?

273
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,083
Yeah!

274
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,541
We'll take advantage
of the confusion

275
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,750
of the game to give that
worthless sea louse a poundin'!

276
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,458
Quite the perfect plan,
if I do say so myself!

277
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,041
Try not to screw
this up, you three!

278
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,791
You! Quickly,
which one of these

279
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,958
boys is Nagasumi Michishio, gyo?

280
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,208
There. That's him.

281
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,500
[Kai still laughing]

282
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,875
[MAGURO] Take that you!

283
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,500
How dare you torment
the boss with a cat, gyo?

284
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,500
[KAI] You three obviously got
death wishes, kickin' me!

285
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,000
[AJITARO] Can it,
you NASA wannabe!

286
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,416
Those morons.

287
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,291
If the boss wanted
him worked over,

288
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,791
then why didn't he just have
me beat up the tasty human?

289
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,250
[MAKI] 'Cause you'd
eat him, Fujishiro.

290
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,625
That's a bad thing?

291
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,583
[MAKI] Miss Sun would
prob'ly say so, yeah.

292
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,666
[KAI] That's it!

293
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,291
I'll fillet every
last one of ya!

294
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,083
Get back here!

295
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
Wow... you sure
were right Mikawa.

296
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,708
You got your butt kicked ten
times better than I would've.

297
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,833
[GIRL] Boy, I'm hungry!

298
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,791
[GOZABURO] You dipshits!
[glass breaks]

299
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,291
I can't believe you
clobbered the wrong guy!

300
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,000
Now go back out there and
freakin' cream the right maggot!

301
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,250
We, we're real sorry,
Boss! (gyo)

302
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,833
Maki! This time you're leadin'
the attack personally!

303
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,166
[MAKI] On it! C'mon boys!
Let's go kick some ass!

304
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,625
[ALL] Gyo!

305
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,750
Right. That's the
sea louse, there.

306
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,916
Get ready.

307
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,541
[BURIO] Hey hey hey!

308
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,041
[MAGURO] You hold
it right there, gyo!

309
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,458
Yeah, ya stinkin'
shriveled up sardine!

310
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,750
[kitty meows]

311
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
[ALL]
Oh crap.

312
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,375
[kitty meows]

313

did you learn your lesson?

Yeah. I guess bringing
a kitten to school

probably wasn't the brightest
idea that I've ever had.

win against a feline

brought the cat to school.

I'll take it from you!

No, it's alright.

I thought you

Just so you know,
this behavior is
