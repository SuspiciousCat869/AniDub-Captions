00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,791
have to humor him,
Grandma.

158
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,041
I swear to you
that I'm not making this up!

159
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,083
I can't count the
legends I've heard

160
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,708
about mermaids in
the Seto Inland Sea.

161
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,416
People are always claiming
to see them in these parts.

162
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,125
Do they really?

163
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,958
And ya just better hope
the legends aren't true.

164
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,833
Or else you're gonna be
in a whole heap of trouble.

165
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,833
What do you
mean by trouble?

166
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,250
C'mon, mom.

167
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,416
He was just dreaming.
I found him asleep on the beach.

168
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,583
It wasn't a dream!

169
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,333
I don't know where
he gets this stuff from.

170
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,875
You raised me, didn't you?

171
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,416
Just let me describe
her for you, okay?

172
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,833
She had this long,

173
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,375
--[SUN] Uh, hello. Good evening.
--pretty auburn hair,

174
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,875
--Who's this?
--and she just looked..

175
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,000
--It's a little late for guests,
--like a mermaid, y'know?

176
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:33,875
--isn't it?
--like a mermaid, y'know?

177
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,333
She was actually really cute.

178
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,083
[NAGASUMI] Yeah!
Like this girl!

179
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
She looked like this.

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
[MOM]
Shut up!

181
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,375
Well now. There somethin'
we can do for ya, young lady?

182
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,750
Yes, thank you.

183
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,375
Well, uh, see my
name is Sun Seto.

184
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,166
[GRANDMOTHER] Sun Seto, huh?

185
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,416
--Mermaid! Mermaid...!
--So then, are you a

186
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,041
--Mermaid! Mermaid...!
--friend of Nagasumi's?

187
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,250
--[DAD] Snap out of it!
--I'm pretty sure he doesn't

188
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,166
--[DAD] Snap out of it!
--know anybody that

189
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,208
here in Kagawa.

190
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,916
Nagasumi? That's you?

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,541
That's me.

192
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,291
Okay. Well.

193
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,791
Will you please.
Will you...

194
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,000
Will you please
take me as your bride!

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,458
[SUN] Please take
me as your bride!

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,958
Ya see. I
know this is kinda

197
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,666
sudden and you must
be surprised, but, well.

198
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,291
I need you to
take responsibility for

199
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,750
what happened between
us this afternoon.

200
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
[SUN] Responsibility
for what happened.

201
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,166
What do you mean?

202
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,833
[DAD] What the hell have you
done, you little fappy bastard?

203
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,041
[DAD] How could you?

204
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,625
And right behind your
dear ol' dad's back?

205
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,833
You just had to go
and make me bust

206
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,916
out my left hook--didn't you?

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,708
All I did was drown,
I swear!

208
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,166
And what does
"fappy" even mean?

209
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,541
That's not a real word!

210
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
[MOM] I can't believe
you'd do such a fappy thing!

211
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,375
You're not even
in high school yet!

212
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,708
What were you thinking?

213
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,875
--What are you talking about?
--That poor girl!

214
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,541
[MASA] Excuse me.
Sorry to bother so late.

215
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,333
[MOM AND DAD] Yakuza?

216
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,500
[MOM] The one in the
middle is kind of hot, though.

217
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,708
Honey?

218
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,458
[GANGSTER A] Oh, come on!

219
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,083
Does every housewife
think he's hot?

220
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,000
[GANGSTER B] I ain't getting'
in the middle of this one!

221
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,291
Shut your mouths
and keep 'em that way.

222
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,458
[GANGSTERS] Yes sir.

223
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,791
We're with Miss Sun.
I apologize for this

224
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,666
inconvenience
but I do regret to say.

225
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,625
That you're gonna
have to come with us.

226
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,125
Both of you,
Mr. and Mrs. Michishio.

227
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,000
[MASA] Miss Sun's
father, my boss,

228
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,958
is eager to meet
with the two of you.

229
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,541
And he's not the type
of man you keep waiting.

230
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,958
[MOM AND DAD] She's
a yakuza daughter!

231
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,041
Nooooo!!!

232
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,041
[MASA] I need you
to follow me now.

233
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,041
[GRANDMOTHER] S'just
like I said it would be.

234
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,708
He's in a whole heap of trouble.

235
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,000
[NAGASUMI] Uh, umm.

236
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,666
[NAGASUMI] Is there
any particular reason

237
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,833
you brought us
to a jagged cliff?

238
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,791
[MASA] All right then, everyone.

239
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,833
You three can go first.

240
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
[NAGASUMI]
They're trying to kill us!

241
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,541
The yakuza wants to kill us!

242
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,125
[MOM AND DAD] Nagasumi!

243
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,208
[NAGASUMI] Mom!
Dad!

244
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,375
We blame this on you!

245
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,791
She's dragging me down!

246
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,208
She's actually trying to
make sure that I'm gonna die!

247
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,458
[NAGASUMI] M-Mermaid!

248
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,708
She's the one from
this afternoon!

249
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,541
[GOZABURO] Hey, kid.
Wake up.

250
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,750
[GOZABURO] C'mon,
kid, can ya hear me?

251
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,708
You okay, kid?

252
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,458
Quick Masa!

253
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,375
Mouth-to-mouth!

254
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
[MASA] Yes Sir!
Breathe, dammit!

255
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
[NAGASUMI] I'm fine!
Get up! Get off!

256
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,500
[MOM] I know I shouldn't
be jealous of my son, but...

257
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,916
You do know I can
hear you, dontcha?

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,166
Don't just sit there!
Why didn't you stop him?

259
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,333
Oh, god, that didn't count
as my first kiss, did it?

260
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,750
[MOM] I wish it'd been mine.

261
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,500
At least don't
say it out loud.

262
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,041
[GOZABURO] Somethin' wrong, kid?
Ya seem pretty agitated.

263
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,666
So, uh, where
are we exactly?

264
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,041
Well, Nagasumi, we're in Sun's
house, at the bottom of the sea.

265
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,583
It's a house for mermaids.

266
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,083
[GOZABURO] Thanks for makin'
the trip all the way down here.

267
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm Sun's father,
but most people know me

268
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,750
as the boss of the local outfit
of the Seto Fish Commision.

269
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,375
[GOZABURO] My name
is Gozaburo Seto.

270
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,666
I'm Ren Seto.

271
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,666
His lovely wife
and Sun's mother.

272
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,500
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
We're being held captive

273
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,416
by genuine mobsters!

274
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,916
How could
you do this to us?

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,666
After all we've
done for you.

276
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,791
Alright, enough
of the small talk,

277
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,750
let's just cut
to the chase here.

278
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,875
I brought you all down here 'cuz

279
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,666
my daughter saved your
son's life today.

280
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,041
She saved your life?

281
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,333
Why didn't you
tell us that?

282
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,541
I did!

283
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,958
I told you a mermaid
saved me from drowning!

284
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,458
[GOZABURO] Now listen close
to what I'm about to tell ya.

285
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,625
We live by the code
of the Mermaid law

286
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,708
and according to it,
any mermaid that

287
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,041
lets a human see
their true form...

288
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,625
...is sentenced
to death by execution!

289
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,000
[GOZABURO] We send em' off
to sleep with the fishes, see?

290
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,041
And there ain't nothing
we can do about it!

291
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,541
It has to be done!

292
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,791
Ain't that a pity?

293
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,958
Ain't that a pity my
daughter has to die?

294
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:08,708
[DAD] Uh-huh.

295
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,625
[NAGASUMI] Uh.
Yeah.

296
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,708
[MOM] Certainly.

297
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,791
And it's all yer
fault, ya little shit!

298
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,375
Why the hell should
my daughter have to

299
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,625
die just cuz' you don't
know how to swim? Huh?

300
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,583
[NAGASUMI] I don't know
how to answer that!

301
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,833
[REN] Now dear.

302
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,583
So this whole snafu
got me ta' thinkin'.

303
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,916
Why should a mermaid have
ta die just fer bein' seen.

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,208
[GOZABURO] When I
can solve the problem

305
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,333
by killing the human
who saw her instead?

306
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,708
--That's it!
--Don't sacrifice me!

307
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,166
--I'll just have you killed.
--Don't sacrifice me!

308
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,375
--Hell I'll kill you myself
--Boss, please calm down!

309
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,375
--right now you little BASTARD!
--Calm down!

310
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,708
You've got nothing
to worry about.

311
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,708
You just leave things to me.

312
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,166
[BOTH] 'kay.

313
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,708
--I'm gonna harpoon that

--little piece of fecal matter.
--mother and son fantasies!

315
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,541
[GOZABURO] Let me go!

316
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,958
--[SUN] Knock it off, Dad!
--Let me go! He has to die!

317
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,125
Ya can't kill him!

318
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,833
I saved him so that
he wouldn't die!

319
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,583
[SUN] And killin' him for
no reason is just as

320
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,958
bad as me savin' him
according to the mob code. 

321
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,208
But Sun....

322
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,625
...the code says ya have
to die fer savin' him.

323
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,250
Yeah, and I
can accept that!

324
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,666
I meant ta save his life.
It's my choice.

325
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,958
Go on...

326
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,041
Go ahead: boil me,
grill me, whatever!

327
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,750
[GOZABURO] How
can ya say that, Sun?

328
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,208
Please, just let
Daddy waste this

329
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,791
worthless human and
everything will be fine!

330
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,333
[DAD] Thanks for ruining
our vacation, Nagasumi.

331
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,083
[NAGASUMI] Shouldn't
you be trying to save me,

332
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,500
instead of blaming me?

333
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,041
I really do apologize.
Once my husband's blood

334
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,666
starts to boil,
there's no stopping him.

335
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,916
Uh, that's okay.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,083
And my daughter is
typically very respectful,

337
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,375
but she's got this
stubborn streak about her.

338
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,500
Is that so?

339
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,791
It certainly is, Nagasumi.

340
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,791
We have to adhere
to the mermaid code,

341
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,208
but there is one
solution that doesn't

342
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,875
involve any of this
killing nonsense.

343
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,375
[GOZABURO] No!
Don't tell 'em!

344
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,750
Well you see, Nagasumi.

345
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,666
All you have to do
is marry our daughter.

346
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,166
Marry her?

347
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,041
[REN] Once you're family,
you can know Sun's true form.

348
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,000
It wouldn't be an issue then.

349
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,791
So, what do ya say?
You'll marry into the family,

350
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,041
won't ya handsome?

351
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,125
[Gozaburo growls]

352
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,666
[GOZABURO] Well,
Mr. and Mrs. Michishio.

353
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,083
[GOZABURO] I hate to
say so, but there ya have it.

354
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,666
[GOZABURO]
Yer unworthy son can marry

355
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,250
my precious, wonderful,
beautiful daughter.

356
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,000
He'll take her as his bride,
or we'll just have to

357
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,875
murder every human
that knows about us.

358
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,375
[GOZABURO] And that includes
the two of you as well.

359
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,291
As I'm sure you've
figured out by now.

360
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,958
Murder every human.
That includes the two of you.

361
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,375
You're really gonna love
being married, Nagasumi.

362
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,958
[MOM] I'm just overcome
with joy for you.

363
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,333
[NAGASUMI] Look me
in the eye and say that.

364
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,666
That's right.
Your parents are always

365
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,875
looking out for you,
and we couldn't be happier.

366
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,208
[NAGASUMI]Why don't you use
your left hook on him, Dad?

367
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,833
[MOM] He's all worn out
from using it on you earlier.

368
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,375
[GOZABURO] Somethin'
wrong with ya, punk?

369
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,291
Ya tellin' me that ya
don't think my daughter's 

370
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,666
good enough for
you or somethin'?

371
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,000
I never said that!

372
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,500
I just don't think you
should rush us like this!

373
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,125
I mean, you can't force love.

374
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,083
We don't even
know each other yet.

375
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,291
There's a good chance
that she won't even...

376
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,875
Um, wanna marry me.

377
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,625
[GOZABURO]
Shut yer face, maggot!

378

to die and yer givin'

379
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,000

know each other' crap?

380
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,333
[GOZABURO] There's no
way in hell I'll let

381
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,250
her marry a pathetic
piss ant like you!

I'll kill you!
You small weak fleshy--

Ya oughta respect the bravest
decision of a girl's life!

Masa! Don't you
let him get away!

386
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,958
[NAGASUMI] Wait!
How can you do this!

387
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
You gave me my first kiss.

388
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,791
Well, Nagasumi...

389
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,583
Sorry it turned out like this,
but I don't have a choice.

390
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,750
You'd be dead if it
weren't for her, so it only

391
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,166
makes sense that you
give your life for her now.

392
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,375
[NAGASUMI] That doesn't
make sense at all!

Hold it right there!

Why won't this door open?

Open dammit!

Where did that brat go?

398
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,958
[GANGSTER E] The water
swept him into the house.

399
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,166
[GOZABURO] Rip him
to shreds, Shark Fujishiro!

he's a literal shark!

403
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,458
[SUN] Sorry Fujishiro,
ya can't eat him.

Why'd ya take my food?

Uh, wow, thank you.
You saved me again.

407
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,875
Hurry!

408
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,625
We'll sneak out through
the back entrance!

409
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,541
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
How many times am I gonna

410
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,875
have to be saved today?

411
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,333
[SUN] If you just follow
this tunnel out you'll be fine.

412
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,458
Come on, then!

[VOICES]
Fishy tail!

00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,333
Leave this to me! 'kay.

415
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,625
Um, well. I don't
need to run like you do.

416
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,583
But doesn't it mean that

417
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,541
you'll have to die
if I get away?

418
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,708
But ya don't havta
worry 'bout that.

419
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,708
I am worried about it!

420
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,250
[NAGASUMI] Are you okay, Sun?

421
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,333
I'm fine, are you okay?

422
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,291
[NAGASUMI] Oh yeah,
I'm doing great.

423
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,458
I wonder if Dad's
still chasing us.

424
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,833
[SUN] You just called him "dad."

425
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,750
[NAGASUMI] No, no!
That was a slip of the tongue!

426
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,250
I meant to say your dad.

427
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,000
[SUN] But Nagasumi,
if ya take me with ya,

428
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,583
he'll probably hunt ya all the
way to the end of the universe.

429
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,250
[NAGASUMI] Good point.

Well, no matter what, we're in

Hey...

00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,875
Why did you even
bother saving me when the

433
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,500
mermaid law says that
you're not supposed to?

434

Why'd I save you?

435
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,166
Ya see, Nagasumi.

436
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,541
If I saw somebody in
trouble right in front of me

437
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,958
and I just ignored him,

438
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,625
that would just disgrace
