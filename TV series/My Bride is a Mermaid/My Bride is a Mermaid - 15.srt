158
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,500
Fourteen Thirty:
Go to police memorial.

159
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,666
[NAGASUMI] Quite a schedule.

160
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,708
[LUNAR] Come on, manservant!
Time for a boat ride!

161
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,583
[NAGASUMI] No!
I'm riding with Sun!

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,916
[SUN] Nagasumi! Lunar! Wait up!

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,791
[KAI] I'm ridin'
with Sun, not you!

164
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,583
[CHIMP] I shall
accompany you, my lord!

165
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,208
[MAWARI] No, hold on
a second you guys!

166
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,500
We'll decide by drawing lots!

167
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,500
[SUN] Yea! Looks like we got
paired together, Nagasumi.

168
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,166
[NAGASUMI] Luck
hasn't left me after all!

169
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,500
[Chimp laughs creepily]

170
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,750
[LUNAR] Not Chimp!

171
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,208
How could this
possibly happen? No!

172
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,958
And after I went
to all the trouble of

173
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,541
gettin' a special
boat for Sun, too.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,333
Wait a minute. You don't
mean. That one, do you?

175
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,791
[SUN] Oh how cute!
It's a fried shrimp!

176
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,458
Uh, it's a shachihoko.

177
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,458
Hey! Does that mean
I have to ride in that boat?

178
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,291
No way!

179
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,791
Oh well,
the pairs are set,

180
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,375
so why don't we just get in the
boats without complaining.

181
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,208
We're thirsty, manservant!
Go and get us a drink now!

182
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,291
You're in a really bad
mood, aren't you?

183
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,708
[LUNAR] Quit your
yammering, manservant! GO!

184
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,958
[SUN] I coulda gone
for it, Nagasumi.

185
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,833
Sun, help! You stay
here and keep an

186
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,208
eye on this creep, ya got it?
It's touching us! 

187
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,750
[SUN] Okay.

188
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
[collision and gasps]

189
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,583
[CLASS REP]
That hurt.

190
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm so sorry!

191
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:39,541
[Class Rep groans]

192
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,041
Hey, are you okay?

193
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,208
[CLASS REP] Glasses, glasses,
where are my glasses?

194
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,833
[NAGASUMI] I'm sorry!

195
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,458
I ran into you and
broke your glasses!

196
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,708
It's all right.

197
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,166
Really. I have an extra
pair of glasses at home.

198
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,500
[NAGASUMI]
But... but still.

199
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,458
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Hey.
This girl is kinda cute.

200
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,083
[CLASS REP] Yes?

201
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,041
At least let me pay you.

202
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I'll have to
borrow from Lunar or something.

203
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,083
She's a celebrity. She's rich.

204
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,208
[NAGASUMI] Um, would you mind
coming with me for a minute?

205
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,333
My friends are at the
boat stand over there.

206
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,583
[CLASS REP] Oh, sure no problem.

207
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,625
[NAGASUMI] I'm really
very sorry for all the trouble.

208
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,500
[NAGASUMI THINKS] She seems
so nice. I wonder who she is.

209
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,958
[NAGASUMI] Oh... hey, could you
hold on for just a second.

210
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,583
[CLASS REP]
Um. Sure.

211
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,625
If I don't buy some drinks,
Lunar will punish me for sure.

212
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,666
You pervy monkey!
Just stay back!

213
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,375
Sun please! Let us
into that boat with you!

214
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,291
Hey Lunar be careful or
yer gonna tip over the boat!

215
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,666
Shut up and get
out of our way!

216
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,708
Let us in there right now!

217
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,000
[Lunar cries out]
[splash]

218
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,000
[WOMAN] We're
picking up something!

219
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,666
[NAGASUMI] Sun!

220
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,750
Oh I'm sorry! Could you please
wait there for a moment?

221
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
[CLASS REP] Oh... okay.

222
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,291
[SUN] Aw, that was a really
mean thing to do, Lunar.

223
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,875
[CHIMP] Ooh!
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy.

224
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,666
That a tail?

225
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,625
[NAGASUMI] Oh crap, that was
a really close call there, Sun.

226
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,583
Chimp almost saw
your mermaid form.

227
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
I'm sorry...

228
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,125
It's 'cause Lunar was
being real careless, ya see.

229
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,500
Yeah, well, this dumb,

230
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,291
pervy chimp wouldn't
leave us alone.

231
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,500
[NAGASUMI]
Of course, right, his fault,

232
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,041
sure, pervy, etcetera, etcetera.

233
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
So, Lunar, can I
borrow some money?

234
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,625
Money for a piece
of scum like you?

235
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,625
[NAGASUMI]
So that's a 'no' then?

236
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,958
[LUNAR] We don't mind.
Take this card.

237
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,208
[NAGASUMI] Oh, uh, thanks!

238
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,166
But of course.
It's at ten percent interest,

239
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,666
to be paid every ten days.

240
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,291
And if you can't pay, you'll
be our manservant forever!

241
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,500
Ah crap, I knew this
was too good to be true!

242
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,625
Obviously it was...

243
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,916
And now you're our
manservant for life!

244
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,333
That was you?

245
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,916
Don't worry about
us right now, Nagasumi.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,125
We're fine, ya see.

247
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,958
Just go find that girl
with the glasses, okay?

248
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,458
We'll kill you!

249
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,083
[SUN] Ya see, ya looked like ya
wanted to swim too, Lunar.

250
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,416
This is payback!

251
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,416
[LUNAR] Come back here, you!

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,041
[NAGASUMI] Hey, stop it you two!

253
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,250
Maybe mermaids just
need to swim sometimes.

254
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,208
[NAGASUMI] Sorry for the wait!

255
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,000
[NAGASUMI] Sorry again.
I only have a credit card.

256
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
[NAGASUMI] Do you
think you could come

257
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,500
with me to an eyeglasses shop?

258
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,958
Oh, sure, that's fine,

259
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958
but you don't have to
go to all this trouble.

260
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,333
[NAGASUMI] No, it's no trouble.

261
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,625
[CLASS REP THINKS] Hmm...

262
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,708
There's something
familiar about his voice.

263
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,916
It kinda reminds
me of Nagasumi's...

264
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
[CLASS REP THINKS] Nah...

265
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,166
Nagasumi's out on his
big double date right now.

266
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,125
What would he be
doing here in the park?

267
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,041
[NAGASUMI] Is there
something the matter?

268
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,458
[CLASS REP] Oh no,
it's nothing really.

269
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,916
Your voice just sounds
like someone I know.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,083
[NAGASUMI] Yeah?

271
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,166
Tell me about this guy,
so what's he like?

272
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,583
[CLASS REP] Well there's
this good friend of mine

273
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,166
who has wanted
to be a police officer

274
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,041
ever since she was a little kid.

275
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,583
[NAGASUMI] Oh...

276
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,416
You know, I actually have a
friend who's exactly like that.

277
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,958
What a coincidence.

278
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
And then there's this boy who's
a childhood friend of hers.

279
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,208
It's his voice that
yours reminds me of.

280
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,416
[NAGASUMI] Ah, so this
guy's a friend of a friend?

281
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,166
A type of distant acquaintance
situation is that it?

282
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,208
Distant? I guess so, more
of an acquaintance.

283
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,875
[CLASS REP] But there's
something about him.

284
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,291
I don't know.

285
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,583
He isn't particularly
attractive or anything, but...

286
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,708
When he talks, his good

287
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,458
personality really
shines through.

288
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
And he can be very kind,
especially to people who are

289
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,833
weaker than him and need help.

290
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,583
And lately he's
been maturing a little.

291
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,083
Becoming more
of a man every day.

292
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,500
My heart kinda starts racing

293
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,875
whenever I'm talking about him,
you know what I mean?

294
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,625
That's interesting.
So, do you love him?

295
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,125
Wh-Wh-What
are you talking about?

296
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,583
I never said anything like that!
No way! Love! No! Not me.

297
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,208
Whoa...
She's an open book.

298
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,583
[NAGASUMI] Listen,
you have to live every

299
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,666
day of your life so
you'll have no regrets.

300
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,208
Because you never know
when your life's going to end!

301
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,625
[CLASS REP] Huh?

302
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,000
For all you know, tomorrow
you could be chased around

303
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,000
by an over protective
father wielding a big knife,

304
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,791
or abandoned in a
dungeon for days at a time,

305
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,833
never knowing when you
might be drowned in the bay!

306
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,875
Sorry... It seems I lost my
cool there for a little bit.

307
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,833
Please disregard
what I just said.

308
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,750
[CLASS REP] Right.

309
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,208
Anyway, my point
is that you can

while you're still alive.

00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,041
You gotta at least try.

312
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,291
Yes... Yes,
I think you're right.

313
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,416
[CLASS REP THINKS]
I wonder if I love Nagasumi.

314
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,208
I keep feeling
this pain in my chest.

315
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,416
Is this what they call love?
This ache that won't go away?

[respirator sound]

317
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,000
[KAI THINKS] Come ta think
of it, this is the first time

318
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,458
I've been alone with
a girl other than Sun.

319
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,708
[MAWARI THINKS]
Come to think of it,

320
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,333
this might be the
first time I've ever been

321
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,833
alone with a boy
other than Nagasumi.

322
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,791
[MAWARI THINKS]
Mikawa's breathing really hard.

323
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,416
We're in a boat
with no one around.

324
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,666
[MAWARI THINKS] All alone.
A young boy and a young girl.

[VOICES] You're my friend,
but you look tasty!

You come any closer and I'll
arrest you for indecency!

328
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,416
Stay right there!

329
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,958
[KAI] Huh?

330
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
[KAI] Hey, Mawari,
that's dangerous!

331
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,750
Ya need ta sit
back down quickly!

332
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,541
I swear that
I will arrest you Kai!

[KAI] What're you doing?

335
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,083
[Kai and Mawari cry out]

336
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,250
[CHIMP THINKS] My lord.

337
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,791
Oh, holy crap!
Are you okay?

338
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,541
[CLASS REP] I'm so sorry!

339
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,541
Without my glasses,
I can't see anything.

340
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,625
[NAGASUMI] Well here...

341
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,291
Why don't you hold
onto my arm then?

342
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,000
[CLASS REP] Thank you.

343
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,708
[CLASS REP THINKS]
I can't ever let Nagasumi

344
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,750
see me look this
clumsy and pathetic.

345
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,541
As far as I'm concerned,
the guy you like

346
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,833
would just be
lucky to have you.

347
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,125
Why don't you just
tell him how you feel?

348
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,291
No. No,
I can't do that!

349
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,541
A cute girl like you shouldn't

350
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,333
have any trouble
snagging some guy.

351
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,583
Take it from me.
I guarantee it!

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,458
Thank you for saying that.
That gives me some confidence.

353
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,375
[NAGASUMI] The eyeglasses
shop is this way, isn't it?

354
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,958
[CLASS REP] It's just a
little past the athletic field.

355
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,708
It sounds real
lively down there.

356
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:01,916
Is there some sort of boys'

357

baseball game going
on or something?

358
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,000
No, I don't think so.

359
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,583
It looks like a bunch
of old guys are playing.

360
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,291
Come on now!
We can't lose.

361

Knock it outta the park!
Crush that ball!

[NAGASUMI] Oh no!
Not them!

363
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,958
Crush that ball!

364
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:18,333
Boss, take a look at the
top of the hill! Gyo!

nosed maggot! Gyo!

Walking with a chick!

00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,208
Could it be we've caught
him red handed

368

cheating on your
beautiful daughter?

Alright...

00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,333
Now let's drown
the maggot in the river.

372
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,791
Yes sir, boss sir.

373
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,375

...that boy was only trying
to replace my glasses.

377
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,333
That's all that it was...

378
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,083
I promise you, we haven't
done anything wrong.

379
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,916
Wait a second.

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,583
Isn't that girl one of
the students at the school?

381
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,583
What? I don't remember
anyone like this girl.

382
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,125
[REN] She's got an explanation.

383
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,916
She says they haven't
done anything wrong.

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,333
Just let 'em go.

385

[GOZABURO] All right, fine!
I'll release the maggot then.

386

[GOZABURO] But in return...

[GOZABURO] Take a
turn at bat before ya go.

388

But why?

389
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,708
[GOZABURO]
If he dies on the field,

390
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,458
it'll be treated
like an accident.

But there's no need to
get my own hands dirty.

00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,666
[CLASS REP THINKS] Why has
Nagasumi been acting so distant,

467
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
like he just met
me or something?

468
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,000
Could it be he doesn't
recognize me?

I can work with this!
