00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,416
It's a snake!

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,041
Oh no, Sun!

158
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:35,291
Bite it, snake now!
Liquid Machine Gun!

159
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,333
[Maki laughs insanely]

160
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,541
You go ta Hell!

161
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,000
Everything is going
to be fine, Miss Sun!

162
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,958
Maki killed the mean ol'--!

163
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,041
You all right?

164
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,208
Ha-has the snake
gone away now?

165
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,416
Yeah.

166
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,333
[MAKI] Oh no!
There's a poisonous snake!

167
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,500
[SUN] A snake?

168
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,083
What, Maki, there's
still a snake here?

169
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,416
Yes, there is!

170
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,166
A disgusting, poisonous snake!
He's right there!

171
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,875
What's with this shell chick?

172
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,250
[MAKI] You see this,
sea louse?

173
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,125
The water pouring out
of this shell is limitless!

174
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,333
Let's see how you enjoy a

175
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,958
little taste of my
water bullets.

176
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,375
Maki, what exactly are
you shooting at?

177
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,958
Uh, well,
you see, Miss Sun.

178
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
The snake looked
so big and dangerous

179
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,291
that I just started
shooting, you know?

180
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,541
[SUN] Oh, okay.

181
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,416
Thanks for always
looking out for me, Maki.

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,708
Oh, you don't
have to thank me.

183
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,708
Hey, Nagasumi, whatcha
doin' down there?

184
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,958
[NAGASUMI]
Oh, it's nothing, Sun.

185
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,000
That horrible, poisonous
snake almost got me too,

186
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,375
but I'm fine now.
Really, everything's okay.

187
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,958
All right.

188
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,166
Well, in that case, do you think
that I could ask you a favor?

189
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,125
Of course.

190
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,416
It's just that,
when I get a sunburn,

191
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,375
my skin gets
all red and swollen.

192
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,666
I have some sunscreen.

193
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,125
Would ya rub it
on my back for me.

194
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,083
Can, can I really do that?

195
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,958
[SUN] Sure.

196
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,833
You won't be rubbin'
anything on anyone, punk.

197
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,125
Do ya get me?

198

[NAGASUMI THINKS]
She's gonna kill me!

199
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Hey, Sun, look up there!
It's a UFO.

200
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,208
--What? Where? Where's the UFO?
--[MAKI] What're you doin'?

201
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,291
I don't see it!
Where? Show me!

202
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,416
Uh, Nagasumi,
I don't see anything up there.

203
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,250
Whoops, sorry.
It must have been a bird.

204
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,000
What a stupid mistake to make.

205
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,166
Oh, okay.

206

That's the meanest conch

207
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,875
that I've ever met.

208
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,458
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Sun was
the one who saved my life.

209
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,458
I'd behave myself
around her even without an

210
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,791
assassin chaperone
watching my every move.

Uh, Nagasumi.

No, it's nothing, really.

circles around my head.

[NAGASUMI] Why you little--!
Don't underestimate me.

I'm not gonna lose to

game they're playin'?

awfully hard for this.

Huh, ya pervy punk?

am I doing just standing here?

I have to tell Sun.

we're leaving tomorrow.

changed back into mermaid fins.

form while I'm wet yet.

able to when I grow up.

[NAGASUMI] Well,
when are you officially

270
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,625

[SUN] Dunno exactly.
Eighteen. Maybe twenty.

272
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,041
[NAGASUMI] So is
that really how it works?

[NAGASUMI]
Oh, well hi there, Maki.

275
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,250
So your shell can
float then, I see.

276
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,791
[MAKI] Yes. I can make it sink
or float whenever I want.

277
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,791
[NAGASUMI] All right.

any harm by it, ya see.

cruel as that, I'm sure.

It must be my fault for being
oversensitive, I guess.

So that's how you're going to

00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,333
Oh, hey, I know!
Miss Sun, I have an idea.

297
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,416
We should go
and see a coral reef!

298
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,875
[MAKI] They're rare
even here in Seto,

299
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,291
so Nagasumi shouldn't miss the

300
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,250
chance to see one,
don't you agree?

301

Yes! Let's go.
Sound good, Nagasumi?

302
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,500
[NAGASUMI] Huh?
Yeah. Sure.

303
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,000
[MAKI] Oh, wow!

304
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,250
That reef is
just beautiful, isn't it?

305
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,083
[SUN] Oh, I'm so sorry!

306
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,083
[SUN] I had no clue humans were
so sensitive to water pressure.

307
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,875
[MAKI] It's all my
fault, Miss Sun.

308
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,250
[SUN] Maki?

309
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,291
I don't understand this.
How could you marry a human

310
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,333
who couldn't live
underwater with you?

311
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,416
It doesn't make sense.

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,416
[MAKI] It wouldn't be a good
situation for you or for him.

313
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,958
I just don't think...
I don't think the two of you

314
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,375
really belong
together, Miss Sun.

315
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,000
I said too much.
Sorry about that.

316
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,625
I'll look after Nagasumi
while he recovers.

317
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
You should go see about
finding yourself a towel

318
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,625
so that you can
get completely dried off.

319
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,250
[MAKI] You can't do
anything on land like that.

320
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,000
You need your human form.

321
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,833
[SUN] Y-Yeah. You take
care of Nagasumi, okay?

322
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,291
Yes!

323
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,791
So that's what
your plan is now?

324
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,875
[MAKI] Well, so you
were awake, huh?

325
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,291
[MAKI] If I just whacked
you like normal,

326
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,916
Miss Sun would be very upset.

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,083
[MAKI] And that's
exactly why the boss

328
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,333
ain't done nothin'
to your sorry ass yet

329
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,666
Are you kidding?

330
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
The man is almost
constantly trying to kill me!

331
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,541
[MAKI] So the first part of the
plan is to get her doubtin' ya.

332
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,750
Thinkin' about how
hard it is for land creatures

333
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,416
and sea creatures
to live together.

334
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,750
I think I just took pretty
good care of that part.

335
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,791
And now you're gonna die
right here in a tragic accident.

336
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,166
[MAKI] This way she
can forget about ya

337
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,625
without blaming me or
the boss for your death.

338
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,875
Then you brought me to this

339
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,375
deserted island so
there'd be no witnesses!

340
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,208
[MAKI] If land folks find
out about us sea folks,

341
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,333
either the sea folks

342
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,291
or the land folks
gotta get wiped out.

343
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,083
That's the way it's been
for generations now.

344
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,458
[NAGASUMI] Sun saved me
even though she knew the law.

345
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,208
Even though she knew
she might die for doing it.

346
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,791
If Sun tells me to die,
then that's what I'll do.

347
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,208
If she tells me to live...

348
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,791
Then I'll do anything
to make that happen!

349
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,083
[MAKI THINKS] The punk's
displaying manly chivalry

350
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,291
for the one who
he owes his life to.

351
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,875
[MAKI] Can it, kid!

352
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,875
If ya die, Miss Sun will be free
to do whatever she wants.

353
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,833
You die now!

354
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,583
[blast]

355
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,041
[MAKI] Oh.
Miss Sun.

356
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,083
[SUN] Maki stop.
I've heard enough now.

357
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,916
You said he'd die and
that you'd make it look

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,333
like it was just an accident.

359
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,625
[MAKI] Mi-Miss Sun, wait.

360
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,625
What were ya thinkin' of?
I won't have it.

361
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,708
That would disgrace
all Seto mermaids.

362
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,333
But listen, Miss Sun.

363
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't ya see,
Maki, I'm beggin'.

364
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,916
Miss Sun, why are
you crying? Stop.

365
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,833
If you're angry then
yell at me or something.

366
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,416
Please tell me...

367
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,250
The reason ya did this is 'cause
ya care about me, is that right?

368
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,958
That's right, Miss Sun.

369
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,375
I'm really so sorry!
Miss Sun, I'm really, sorry!

370
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,208
[MAKI] Sorry sea louse.

371
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,583
You can either apologize
or pick a fight, not both.

372
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,000
[MAKI] Oh, Miss Sun!

373
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,541
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Well, I guess it's okay.

374
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,000
Maki won't come after
me anymore, at least.

375
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,375
[MASA] So Nagasumi
made it safely then.

376
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,166
I never thought
I'd see the day when

377
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,166
Maki the Conch
let someone get away.

378
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,416
Hah!

379
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,375
I just wasn't in the mood,
that's all, Masa.

380
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,958
[MAKI] Ya'd better
thank your lucky stars

381
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,583
for Miss Sun, ya damn sea louse.

382
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,708
[NAGASUMI]
Uh. Sun.

383
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,250
Yeah, what?

384
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,541
[NAGASUMI] It's just...

385
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,375
Well, there's something
that I need to tell you.

386
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,625
What ya been thinkin'
about since this mornin'?

387
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,041
Oh, so I guess
you noticed huh?

388
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,291
Well then...
Some things happened,

389
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,666
and I have to go home
to Saitama tomorrow.

390
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,625
I'll come back for
winter break, though.

391
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,083
Actually, no, I'll be back on
the next long weekend.

392
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,875
So wait for me, okay?
Will you?

393
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,625
[NAGASUMI] We can handle
a long-distance relationship,

394
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,208
I'm sure.

395
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,875
Uh, Nagasumi?

396
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,291
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

397
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,625
Is that what ya've been
thinkin' about this whole time?

398
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,250
[NAGASUMI] Oh... Yeah,
that was pretty much it.

399
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,125
[SUN] Didn't ya hear about it?
I thought ya would've.

400
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm gonna come and
live with you in Saitama.

401
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,750
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

402
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,125
What the hell?

403
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,958
[SUN] After all. I am your
future wife, Nagasumi.

404
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,875
Ya see. I have to do this
thing wholeheartedly.

405
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,041
Or else I'll disgrace all
of the Seto mermaids.

406
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,166
Because 'honor among thieves'
is 'honor under the seas'!

407
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,666
I know I'm not
anything special,

408
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,208
but I'll always do my
best to make you happy.

409
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,041
But, but we're
still just in junior high!

410
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,541
And changing schools
can be very rough.

411
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,583
And where are these cherry
petals always coming from?

412
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,333
What the hell
is going on here?

413
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,333
[MAKI] Boss.
Is this really true?

414
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,916
[MAKI] Is it, Boss?

415
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,916
[GOZABURO] Thing is. Sun came
to me and said "Ya see,

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,125
I'm gonna be his wife,

417
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,041
so I'm goin' ta live
with him in Saitama."

418
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,458
[MAKI] So that's why ya've been
so upset since yesterday then?

419
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,666
[GOZABURO] Shut yer damn trap!

420
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,708
[MAKI] Right.
Yes sir!

421
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,250
I'm so sorry
for this, Boss.

422
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,250
If it's necessary,
I'll strap dynamite

423
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,000
to myself and jump
on that fappy loser.

424
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,041
[GOZABURO] Am I leakin'
red or something, Maki?

425
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,125
[MAKI THINKS] He...
He's crying tears of blood!

426
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,625
I've never seen a
sorrow this deep before!

427
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,750
[GOZABURO] Sun decided this.
She decided for herself.

428
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,416
So I'm just gonna
watch over her, that's all.

429
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,750
Yes, of course Boss. If that's
what you're going to do,

430
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,083
Boss, then I'll
do just the same.

431
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,583
I'll watch over her too.

432
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,666
[GOZABURO] That's right, Maki.

433
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,500
All we can do now
is watch over her.

434
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:53,333
My darling girl.
Sun!

435
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,625
[GRANDMA]
Well, we'll see ya later then.

436
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,958
You take care
of yourselves, okay?

437
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Sun must be really nervous.

438
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,541
She's leaving everything behind.
All her friends, her family,

439
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,166
her whole life
is back there in Seto.

440
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,291
I still can't really
believe she'd

441
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,458
be willing to
do all of this for me.

442
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,291
[NAGASUMI] To think I
just went to visit Grandma

443
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,208
for summer break,
and ended up bringing

444
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,041
such a cute girl home
to Saitama with me.

445
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,250
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
And then there was that other

446
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,125
big event this summer...
When Masa gave me...

447
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,458
My first kiss!

448
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
But most importantly of all,

449
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,208
I'm finally free from those two!

450
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,541
That's right!
No one can get in my way now!

451
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,958
I have a whole new life with
Sun waiting for me in Saitama!

452
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,125
Just us.

453
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,791
[GOZABURO]
The only thing I can do.

454
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,583
The only thing that
I can do now.

455
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,750
The only thing I can do
for my girl is watch over her!

456
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,833
Wait a sec.

457
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,416
I thought I saw
something right there.

458
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,750
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Sun,
