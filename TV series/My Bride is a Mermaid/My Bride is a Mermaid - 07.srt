that I'm going

159
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,375
to be killed now that I've
seen your mermaid form?

160
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,083
My you do
catch on quickly.

161
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,958
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Why does
this keep happening to me?

162
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,333
[SUN] Stop it now.

163
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,541
[SUN] Yer talkin'
about horrible stuff

164
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,625
like killin' right in front
of my own house?

165
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,083
So now what's
all the fuss about?

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,958
My, the rain stopped
as suddenly as it started.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,041
Long time no see.
Sun Seto.

168
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,750
I recognize you.
You're Lunar Edomae!

169
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,875
[LUNAR] That's right.

170
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,708
Your fearsome rival,
your arch nemesis,

171
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,541
the famous singer Lunar Edomea

172
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,166
has come to pay
you a visit, Sun.

173
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,666
[SUN] Wow, it's been
so long, Lunar!

174
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,416
Don't hug
us so familiarly!

175
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,166
So, when the hell
did you arrive here?

176
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,208
A respectful mermaid would've
come to see us long before now!

177
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,583
[SUN] Oh... sorry.

178
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,000
Lots of stuff happened,
and I kinda forgot about ya.

179
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,916
Ooh look! It's the
pretty little singer

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,750
from the yakuza
singing contests.

181
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
[SUN] Give back
Nagasumi now, please.

182
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,791
Oh yes,
of course, here.

183
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,041
I'll have you
know that we

184
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,416
never once forgot
about you, Sun!

185
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,083
We remember what you did to us!

186
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,000
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
This girl's a bit different

187
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,875
from the Lunar that I've seen.

188
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,750
You certainly seem used
to drying off tails, human.

189
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,958
[NAGASUMI]
You have no idea.

190
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,375
[Sun groans]

191
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,000
[LUNAR] Now there's something
I'd like to know about.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,458
What sort of
relationship do

193
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,500
you have with this human?

194
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,291
[LUNAR] He saw your fins
so you agreed to marry him?

195
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,708
Impossible!
How could a noble

196
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,958
mermaid agree to
marry a lowly human?

197
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
[SUN] But there's
a really good story

198
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,958
about a mermaid
marryin' a human.

199
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,500
That story is fiction,
and it doesn't end well.

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,833
Why can't we get it over
with and kill him already?

201
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,000
Ya know, Lunar,
yer kinda mean.

202
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,000
That's exactly why Sun
took me into her family.

203
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,000
To avoid either
of us being killed.

204
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,708
Uh huh,
and your point is?

205
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,291
[NAGASUMI] So I won't
let you kill me, Lunar.

206
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,250
I'll do whatever I can
to stop you and I won't

207
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,875
go down without a fight.

208
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,333
I owe her that much.

209
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,000
My life belongs
completely to Sun now.

210
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,875
Thank ya, Nagasumi.

211
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,083
[SUN] What is it?

212
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,500
[LUNAR THINKS] We lost to
Sun in the singing contests.

213
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,708
Every single time.

214
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,250
[LUNAR] To us,
singing was everything.

215
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,750
To her, singing was nothing
but silly nursery rhymes.

216
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,416
To prove that we
were better than Sun,

217
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,583
we dedicated our
lives to singing.

218
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,958
We even entered the
entertainment industry

219
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,833
and struggled long and hard,
clawing our way to the top.

220
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,125
And when we came to her
to flaunt our musical success.

221
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,083
That girl.
That girl.

222
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,666
She turns around and flaunts
this human boy in our face!

223
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,125
Why Sun? Why do
you always make us feel

224
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,875
bad about what
we don't have, huh?

225
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,625
What do you mean,
what you don't have?

226
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,791
 In that case, Sun.
We'll take him.

227
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,500
We'll take that
husband of yours.

228
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,958
He saw us in our true
mermaid form, after all.

229
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,833
His puny life is
our rightful property.

230
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,875
Uh-oh. I don't
like this at all. Not good.

231
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,625
[LUNAR THINKS] That's right.
We'll steal Sun's happiness.

232
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,166
You're ours, human!

233
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
Just imagine for
the rest of your life,

234
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,916
you'll be our personal
manservant, my darling boy.

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Uh-oh... I don't think I like
the sound of that much, either.

236
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,000
[SUN] I'll teach ya to try
and take what's mine!

237
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,166
I met Nagasumi a long
time before you did, Lunar.

238
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,250
You better back off right now!

239
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,750
Now, now it isn't a question
of chronology is it?

240
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,708
It doesn't matter
who caught him first.

241
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,916
We're just offering to help out.
We can protect him.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,416
I refuse your offer.

243
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,125
I'm gonna be the one
to protect him. Ya see.

244
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,791
Let's go, manservant.

245
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,541
[SUN] Fat chance of that!
Nagasumi lives with me!

246
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,750
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
No way! It can't be true.

247
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,875
This girl isn't Lunar!

248
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,083
My Lunar is sweet
and modest and kind!

249
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,666
A servant's got
no home of his own!

250
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,666
He's not a servant!

251
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,250
Well, then I guess
he'll have to die!

252
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,833
Lunar you're taking this
rivalry thing too far!

253
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
Sun, you brat!

254
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,375
I see you're just as aggressive
and obstinate as ever, huh?

255
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,916
You're one to talk, Lunar!

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,375
I guess a girl
who comes all

257
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
the way to Saitama get married
has some fight in her yet.

258
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,458
Well, okay!

259
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,666
We'll show you
we can fight too!

260
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,291
Starting today,
we'll live in this house,

261
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,708
and we'll be in charge!

262
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,458
Then you'll realize we're
the master of all we see!

263
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,583
Just try 'n stop us.

264
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,750
Bring it on then you, cow!

265
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,000
No, there's no way. Lunar's
nothing like this girl.

266
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
That would just be silly.

267
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,250
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Lunar.

268
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,541
[alarm bell rings]

269
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,166
Aw man too bad.

270
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,791
Just a dream.
None of it was real.

271
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,250
For a second I was hoping that
Lunar really had come here.

272
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,041
Oh good morning
manservant.

273
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
But how could this happen?

274
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,416
This is like those stories
you hear about people

275
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,958
getting all drunk and
then waking up the

276
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,375
next day beside
some strange woman!

277
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,041
Okay, maybe that's
not the best analogy.

278
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,666
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I'm so close to Lunar we're

279
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,833
actually breathing
on each other!

280
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,333
[SUN] Hey!

281
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,666
[NAGASUMI] Sun!

282
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,250
Lunar, I was wonderin'
where ya'd gotten off to!

283
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,458
[LUNAR] Damn.

284
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,708
Ya were supposed ta
be sleeping in my room!

285
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,375
What do 'ya think you're
doing in here with him?

286
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,416
[Lunar chuckles]

287
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,666
Tell me something, Sun.

288
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,291
Have you ever
slept with Nagasumi?

289
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,125
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

290
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:38,875
[SUN] I haven't.

291
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,250
[Lunar laughs]

292
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,125
[LUNAR] Well, then I
suppose we beat you to it!

293
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,000
We slept with your
husband before you!

294
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,916
[SUN] Slept with him?
She slept with him?

295
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,208
[SUN] Even though
I'm Nagasumi's bride,

296
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,041
I didn't get to
be his first kiss.

297
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,625
That kiss was stolen from
him this summer by Masa!

298
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,166
[NAGASUMI] Masa!

299
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,791
[SUN] And then my childhood
friend had an affair with him.

300
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,208
No one's leaving anything
for his promised bride!

301
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,500
[NAGASUMI] I think
'sleeping in the same bed'

302
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,708
is different from
'sleeping with.' Come home!

303
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,041
How lucky you
are to sleep with

304
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,125
your master on
the very first night.

305
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,833
Right manservant?

306
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,583
I'll admit that it
was a little exciting.

307
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,708
[Lunar laughs]

308
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,125
[LUNAR] You hear that?

309
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,666
[LUNAR] My manservant was
excited to sleep with me!

310
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,958
Nagasumi, I'm your bride!

311
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,625
What am I supposed
to do about this?

312
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,458
I don't think
there's anything

313
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,250
you can do about it, Sun.

314
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,416
Nothing Nagasumi?

315
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,791
Are you sure
there isn't anything?

316
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,958
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Whoa!

317
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,875
Sun's holding my
hands so tightly in hers.

318
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,166
I wonder what she
wants to do for me?

319
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,958
[LUNAR] You think you can
touch a mermaid's hands?

320
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,041
Behave yourself!

321
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,166
[LUNAR] Listen up.

322
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,583
You shouldn't have
survived the night.

323
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,750
By rights we should have
had you killed yesterday.

324
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,375
[LUNAR] But we have
mercifully decided to

325
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,083
allow you to live
as our manservant.

326
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Somehow the situation

327
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,958
keeps getting worse and worse.

328
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,291
[LUNAR]
The Michishio family will

329
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,791
remain our servants for life.

330
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,583
You got that, you filthy human?

331
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,583
It's lively up there, huh?

332
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,750
Honey can you pass
the soy sauce?

333
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,916
[BOB] Yeah.

334
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,458
Oh, thank you.

335
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,291
[BOB] Soy sauce.

336
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,291
[DAD] Uh, what?

337
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,458
[BOB] Oh yes! Oh yeah!

338
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,875
Nice.
Nice singing.

339
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,458
It must be difficult to be
one of Lunar's bodyguards.

340
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,708
If you haven't eaten yet,

341
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,208
perhaps you'd
consider dining with us.

342
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,291
It'd be an honor to have you.

343
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,375
[MOM] Welcome to our happy home.

344
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,291
Yes, so happy.

345
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,791
[STUDENT 1] Hey!
Isn't that Lunar, the pop star?

346
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,666
[STUDENT 2] What's a celebrity
like her doing at our school?

347
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,208
[STUDENT 3]
Nagasumi's involved again.

348
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,583
What's with him?

349
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,958
[GOZABURO] I don't feel
good. Too bad I have class.

350
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,958
And now I'll
introduce a new

351
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,708
student who'll be joining us.

352
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,000
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I can't
believe Lunar got all the

353
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,833
transfer paperwork
done in one day.

354
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,000
The entertainment business
can sure pull strings.

355
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,500
Time to introduce
yourself,

356
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,500
only daughter of the
Edomae gang's boss.

357
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,541
So our homeroom
teacher is none

358
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,833
other than the boss of the
Seto gang and Sun's father.

359
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,666
It's nice to
meet all of you!

360
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,916
My name is Lunar Edomae.

361
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
I've transferred here
to this school for

362
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,375
various reasons that
really aren't important.

363
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,375
It's a pleasure to be here!

364
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,458
[GOZABURO] What the hell?

365
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,083
What's gotten into
all of the little brats?

366
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,291
Mister Seto,
are you saying

367
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,750
you don't know who Lunar is?

368
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,958
What? Of course
I know who she is.

369
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,208
She's the Edomae gang boss'--

370
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,875
What he means is that
we used to be neighbors.

371
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,416
Isn't that true, Mister Seto?

372
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,416
Uh, yeah, right.

373
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,708
What do you say, Sun?

374
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,625
Yeah, Lunar and I
were childhood friends.

375
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,791
Wow!
Sun, you're so cool!

376
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,125
Huh?
Why do you say that?

377
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,666
'Cause, you're childhood
friends with a celebrity!

378
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,708
I hope that we're
all going to be friends.

379
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,041
[room erupts in cheers]

380
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,208
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Listening to Lunar today,

381
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,750
she seems really
sweet and cute again.

382
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,958
Yeah... What I saw earlier

383
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,958
must have been
some sort of hallucination.

384
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,083
[SARU] Nagasumi!

385
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,208
[NAGASUMI] Can I help you Chimp?

386
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,791
Only yesterday
you were talking about

387
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,916
how big a fan
you were of her,

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and then today she just

389
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,958
miraculously appears
at our school?

390
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
What, did you stumble
across some sort of

391
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,416
magic lamp or maybe you gathered

392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,583
the seven Dragonballs
or somethin'?

393
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,500
Try not to freak out when
I tell you, but, well, see...

394
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,916
I kinda became Lunar's
manservant somehow.

395
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,458
[SARU] Huh?

396
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,875
[NAGASUMI] I'm sure that you
understand my meaning, Chimp.

397
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,125
So that's how
this happened then?

398
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,666
You somehow went
from being her devoted,

399
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,458
screaming fan to being
her kinky love slave?

400
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,000
[SARU] Seriously?

401
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,000
[NAGASUMI] So, as of yesterday,
Lunar is living at my house.

402
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,166
A love nest!

403
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,666
Your house is now a
love nest, Nagasumi!

404
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,000
Wait, what the hell?
Where's the camera?

405
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,083
I know it's here somewhere!
Where's the camera?

406
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,791
Where's the camera?

407
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,875
It's okay, Chimp.

408
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,041
I don't understand
my meaning either.

409
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,291
Give me a break!

410
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,375
If being a slave meant
you got to live with a

411
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,583
celebrity 100 percent
of the world

412
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,000
would do it without a doubt!

413
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,875
And for now you're keeping
them both all to yourself?

414
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,208
[NAGASUMI] No, at least,
that isn't my intention.

415
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,666
Listen carefully
to what I'm about

416
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,166
to tell ya, kid, because
maybe your pathetic

417
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,416
pea-sized brain just
hasn't noticed this yet.

418
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,708
[SARU] Sun's got long, shiny
hair and beautiful eyes.

419
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,208
She's kind of spacey,
but let's face it,

420
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,875
men are attracted to that,
so she's become very popular.

421
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,416
Right now Sun's
shot to the top of the

422
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,625
chart as our school's
number one star.

423
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
Are you with
me here so far, kid?

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,833
Wha--.
Sun's a star here?

425
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,750
[SARU] And you live with her.

426
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,125
That's enough to
make any man jealous,

427
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,041
but it keeps getting worse
for us normal guys.

428
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,458
[SARU] Lunar's a star not
just here, but nationwide!

429
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,333
She's impish and
sexy and, above all,

430
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,666
blessed with an amazing voice.

431
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,500
Her albums consistently
top the charts.

432
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,791
She's the most popular
pop star out there!

433
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,291
[SARU] And now you're telling me

434
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,250
that you get to
live with her too?

435
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,250
[NAGASUMI]
No, you don't get it...

436
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,458
She forced her
way into my house!

437
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,750
[SARU] That just makes
me more jealous!

438
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,375
[SARU] Is all this world
offers to be yours alone?

439
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,166
And is the torrent of ardent
pathos yours alone as well?

440
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,458
[CLASS REP] Chimp,
could you get down?

441
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,875
We're in homeroom right now.

442
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,416
Your vocabulary really
expands when you

443
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,250
get excited
about something.

444
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,791
Looks like you
got all famous while

445
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,250
I wasn't paying
attention, Lunar.

446
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,083
My, you flatter us.

447
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,541
That wasn't
a compliment.

448
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,083
[GOZABURO] Now go
take the desk next to Sun.

449
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
Looks like we're gonna
be neighbors again, Lunar.

450
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,583
Yeah, it looks like it,

451
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,625
and we're honored to
be sitting next to you.

452
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,875
You've always
sorta followed me

453
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,000
around nippin' at my heels,

454
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,875
but ya do seem
more intense this time.

455
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,250
[LUNAR] Of course we're intense!

456
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,833
We've suffered humiliation
at your hands for too long!

457
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,041
We're getting sick of it.

458
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,125
[SUN] Really?

459
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,333
But when we appeared
on the music scene,

460
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,250
the entire country
acknowledged our greatness!

461
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,416
They loved me
from the first note I sang!

462
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,125
[LUNAR] Basically...
The judging at the

463
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,416
Children's Singing contest
was clearly screwed up.

464
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,916
It must've been rigged.

465
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,291
[LUNAR] Just you wait.

466
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,541
We'll show you how inferior
