00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,958
Nagasumi was still in
the bath when I came in.

159
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,333
[MAKI] It was Nagasumi!

160
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
[MAKI] Nagasumi waited
until Miss Sun and I

161
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,875
were about to take
a bath and then he, he--

162
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,666
Forced his way in.

163
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,791
[DAD] You can take that,
mister Naughty-sumi!

164
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,083
[MOM] How horrible. I don't
know who he takes after.

165
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,083
[MAKI] Nagasumi
is truly a beast.

166
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,250
[DAD] I could just die,
knowing I sired him.

167
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,583
[SUN] What?
No, wait. You're wrong.

168
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,791
[NAGASUMI] And yet,
I don't hear any apologies.

169
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,666
[NAGASUMI] Well, I guess it's
pretty well cleaned up now.

170
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,958
I really am so sorry to be

171
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,958
takin' yer room
like this, Nagasumi.

172
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,375
[NAGASUMI]
Hey, don't worry about it.

173
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,625
The attic won't be so bad
once I clean it up a bit.

174
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,958
But I've been
meaning to ask...

175
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,333
[NAGASUMI] What are
those things up there?

176
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,583
From Dad...

177
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,291
He insisted that I take
them along with me here.

178
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,666
He insisted, huh?

179
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,916
Yep, he did.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,916
Well, is there anything
else that you need now?

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,583
Huh.
Good question

182
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,291
[NAGASUMI] I know!
Let's go shopping.

183
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,500
I can show you
the neighborhood.

184
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,875
Yeah!
Sounds great.

185
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,208
And we can bring Maki, too.

186
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,375
[NAGASUMI]
Oh, no! Maki is--

187
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,166
[SUN] I guess Maki's
pretty tired out, huh?

188
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,625
She has been
goin' full steam 'an all.

189
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,125
[NAGASUMI] Yes, she has.

190
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,291
It would really be
a shame to wake her.

191
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,708
Why don't the two of us
wander around by ourselves?

192
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,916
Yeah, okay!

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,708
[NAGASUMI] Woo-hoo!
No Maki! Yes! Yes! Yes!

194
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,333
[SUN] Wow! That's the
third one so far!

195
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,083
There are so many convenience
stores in your neighborhood!

196
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,208
So I take it there aren't

197
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,541
too many around
your place, huh?

198
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,875
Yeah, our store
was really far away.

199
00:08:58,958 --> 00:08:59,958
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Of course, you idiot.

200
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,833
Her house was at
the bottom of the sea.

201
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,375
[SUN] Only 100 yen,
it says! Only 100 yen!

202
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,208
[SUN] I'll have some jakoten and
some beans with soy sauce.

203
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,000
[SUN] I'm not gonna lose
to some darn mole!

204
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,041
Take that mole!

205
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,083
[SUN] Oh wow!

206
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,916
Look, buses come
every few minutes.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,625
And there are so many!

208
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,125
[SUN] This is a
real huge city, huh?

209
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,541
[NAGASUMI] Well, no, not really.

210
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,791
[NAGASUMI] But I guess that,

211
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,791
compared to your town,
it is kinda big, huh?

212
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,208
It's a fun place
with so many stores!

213
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,416
I'm glad you like it.
This is a lot of fun!

214
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,791
[both laugh]

215
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
It's so peacefully normal

216
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,708
walking around with Sun.

217
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,083
Just the two of us!

218
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,750
I wish this time without
Maki could last forever!

219
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,833
That would be perfect!

220
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:44,333
[MOM] Ahh.. She's out like
a light. How cute!

221
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,250
[MOM] She looks
like a little angel.

222
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,041
[MAKI] I'll kill
you and tear off

223
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,791
your freakin' head, sea louse.

224
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,916
[MAKI] I'll see your guts
spilled all over the floor.

225
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,791
[SUN] What's wrong?

226
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,875
A chill just ran down
my spine suddenly.

227
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,291
Are ya okay? Do we
need to head back home?

228
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,708
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

229
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,833
[GIRL A] No!

230
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,750
[BOY A] What's all of this
stupid screaming about, huh?

231
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Ow, let me go.

232
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,291
Come on. We're just
askin' if you two

233
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,083
wanna grab some tea with us.

234
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,958
[SUN] Hey, you there!

235
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,125
What're ya doin'?

236
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,916
[NAGASUMI] Wait, Sun!
Stop! Please stop!

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,666
There's a police
station nearby, okay?

238
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,125
Telling off guys like that
yourself is a bad idea.

239
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,291
But I'm a mermaid.
I can take 'em down easily.

240
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,666
If anybody sees you
then you're dead meat!

241
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,166
You can't use
your powers in public.

242
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,416
You'll get the death penalty!

243
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,083
But if I abandon
someone who's in trouble

244
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,541
to save my own hide then I'm

245
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,625
a disgrace to all
Seto mermaids, ya see?

246
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,750
[NAGASUMI]
We're not abandoning them!

247
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,583
We're getting the police!

248
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,000
[BOY A] Who're you losers?

249
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,833
Are you stupid punks tryin'
to pick a fight with us?

250
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,208
[whistle]

251
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,166
You two boys
over there!

252
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,041
Stop disturbing the
public order this minute!

253
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,625
Perhaps I need to teach
you a lesson in manners!

254
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,000
--[BOY A] Huh?
--[BOY B] A girl?

255
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,208
You girls there!
Get away, quick.

256
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,708
Oh, yes.
Thank you so much!

257
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,208
Hey!
Wait a second!

258
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,791
Oh wow I can't believe it!

259
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,541
The knightly spirit is alive
even among humans!

260
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,791
Oh no it's--.

261
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,666
[SUN] Huh?
Ya mean ya know her?

262
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh.
Hi, Nagasumi.

263
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,958
[NAGASUMI] That's Isono
Eighth Junior High School's

264
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,458
demonic disciplinary committee
member, Mawari Zenigata!

265
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
[SUN] Disciplinary committee?

266
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,625
Mawari's been my classmate
since elementary school.

267
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,583
If she thinks she's in the
right, she'll charge into a

268
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,041
fight full speed ahead
without thinking

269
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,958
or asking any questions.

270
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:40,916
So I guess
she's a little bit

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,291
of a risk-taker then, huh?

272
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, Sun. She's
exactly like you!

273
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,458
Ya mean I'm like that?

274
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,291
I saw what you did,
Nagasumi.

275
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,583
You were stopping
her from trying

276
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,333
to lash out at those two,
weren't you?

277
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,625
What a reckless girl.

278
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,083
Yeah, well so are you!

279
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,208
Who are you?

280
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,750
You think
you kin ignore us?

281
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,000
Thanks ta you we lost our chance
to go out with those chicks.

282
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,541
Say you're sorry.

283
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,791
I'm sorry if you thought you
had a chance in the first place.

284
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,375
You wanna say that
again ya little brat?

285
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,916
Ya lookin' to fight
us or somethin'?

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,166
Is that it, huh?

287
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,500
No, actually, I'm not.
He's going to fight you!

288
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,083
[NAGASUMI] Why me?

289
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,416
The reason you
were trying to stop her

290
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,125
from fighting those guys
earlier was so that you

291
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,666
could take care of
them in her place,

292
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,541
isn't that right Nagasumi?

293
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,083
How like you!

294
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,875
Damn Mawari's
gonna get me killed.

295
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,333
This sucks!

296
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,875
[SUN] I didn't even realize
that's what he was doing.

297
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,958
I'm an utter failure as a wife.

298
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,041
Now she's charging in, too!

299
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,250
If I don't let
my husband shine,

300
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,750
what kind of wife am I?

301
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,208
You third-rate scum!

302
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,875
You don't stand a
chance against Nagasumi!

303
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,291
[NAGASUMI] Please,
stop the madness!

304
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,041
Yeah, bring it
on you little shit!

305
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,708
You think you can get
all up in our business, huh?

306
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,666
[NAGASUMI] I don't quite
know what that means,

307
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,125
but please don't hurt me!

308
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
There's no way I can fight

309
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,166
these guys at the same time!
I'm in trouble.

310
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,375
Nagasumi!

311
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,791
Are you okay?

312
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,833
It's a good thing that
this river is so deep!

313
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,416
[BOY A] You little bastard!

314
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,625
I will kill you!

315
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,250
[NAGASUMI] Mawari!

316
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,791
I came to give you
a little help, Nagasumi!

317
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,625
[NAGASUMI] Help me?
But you can't swim.

318
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,541
Quit it! You're strangling me!

319
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,500
Well, you're supposed to
help someone who's drowning!

320
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,208
What did you
jump in here for?

321
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,125
To help you, obviously!

322
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,083
[BOY B] Ya threw me in a crick!

323
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,083
I'll whoop ya both for
doing that, just you wait!

324
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,250
You ugly freak!

325
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,416
[BOY B] Whadja call me?

326
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,791
You're gonna pay
for that ya little brat--

327
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,958
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

328
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,666
Wha--.What the--?

329
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,916
You piss ant!
I'll show you!

330
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,500
[NAGASUMI]
What's going on here?

331
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,041
[Sun laughs]

332
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,666
[MAWARI]
Do something Nagasumi!

333
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,708
We're gonna die!
Nagasumi!

334
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,083
Mawari, you overdo
everything!

335
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,791
Why not try thinking first?

336
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,333
Don't jump into a river
if you can't even swim!

337
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,583
Is that any way
to treat someone

338
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,416
who just came to
your rescue in a fight?

339
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,041
Maybe you need a
lesson in manners, too!

340
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,000
[NAGASUMI] You've
always been like this.

341
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,625
[NAGASUMI] You start
fights with people even if

342
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,500
you have no chance
at all of winning them.

343
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,958
You're not a kid anymore,
and you should realize it!

344
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,916
You don't even act like a girl!

345
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,083
Are you saying I don't...
look like a girl either?

346
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,625
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
This particular moment is not

347
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,791
really something
I'd like Sun to see.

348
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,000
[NAGASUMI] No, Sun, wait!
You've got it all wrong!

349
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,291
I don't get why she hasn't
come out of the water.

350
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,833
She's just sitting there.

351
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,166
[NAGASUMI THINKS] That's right!

352
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,458
She's changed back
into a mermaid by now!

353
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,791
Oh, no!

354
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,916
It seems as if Sun is being
swept on downstream.

355
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,083
I really should
go and save her.

356
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,083
[MAWARI] Nagasumi, wait!

357
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,791
[NAGASUMI] How's this, Sun?

358
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,125
I think you're
basically dried off now.

359
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
[SUN] Thank you.

360
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,541
[NAGASUMI] Oh sure.
You're the one who took

361
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,541
care of those guys, right?

362
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,208
I should really
be thanking you.

363
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:12,916
[SUN] So, that girl.

364
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,250
[NAGASUMI] No, no.

365
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,291
She's just a rowdy
childhood friend, that's all.

366
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,916
[SUN] She was incredibly macho!

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,250
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

368
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,541
Saitama's got some
really brave folks in it, huh?

369
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,208
I don't think that 'brave'
is the right word, necessarily.

370
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
Mawari

371
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,958
[NAGASUMI] Maki!

372
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,000
I've been lookin'
for ya, sea louse!

373
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,791
How dare ya sneak
out while I was sleepin

374
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,208
and take Miss Sun to
such a secluded place?

375
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,916
[MAKI] What were ya plannin' ta
do with her, ya perverted snake?

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,375
[NAGASUMI] I haven't
done anything!

377
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,625
[SUN] Uh, Maki?

378
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,166
[MAKI] Oh, Miss Sun!I
do wish you would make

379
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,166
sure to take me with you
when you leave the house!

380
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,875
There are so many
dangers outside!

381
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,833
See!
A scorpion!

382
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,250
A scorpion? Where, Maki?
Where's the scorpion?

383
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
[NAGASUMI]
That isn't true! You liar!

384
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,125
[MAKI] Oh, my!

385
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,458
That scorpion seems
to be getting away!

386
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,875
I need to catch it!

387
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,666
[MAKI] Ya really think
I'd let ya escape?

388
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,083
Ya probably think yer doin'
somethin' clever sneakin' out

389
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,833
while I was
sleepin' don't ya?

390
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,125
[NAGASUMI] It's not like anybody
forced you to take that nap!

391
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,416
[MAKI] Shut yer trap now! And
drop dead, ya fappy bastard!

392
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,333
Well, mister Naughty-sumi,
just what exactly do

393
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,375
you think you're
doing now, huh?

394
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,041
What about you pointing

395
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,333
that stupid little
toy sword at me?

396
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,041
Ha! This little
baby here is famous.

397
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,250
The 'slice of the fugu'
is what she's called.

398
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,541
And the blade is covered with

399
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,500
highly concentrated
tetrodotoxin.

400
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,958
Perhaps you've heard
of it, sea louse?

401
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,416
Just one tiny little
scratch and then you die!

402
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,125
Stop it, no!

403
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,583
[MAWARI] Hey, Nagasumi?
There you are!

404
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,708
Wait, what the
heck are you doing?

405
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,041
W-W-Well,
see I'm uh, uh, uh.

406
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,625
Just playing with my
little doll here, that's all!

407
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.
Dolls are really fun.

408
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,583
Wouldn't you agree
with me, Mawari?

409
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,750
I don't think so.
And why are you playing with

410
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
it in a place like
this, Nagasumi?

411
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS] This is bad.

412
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,750
Under mermaid law,
humans who find out

413
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,791
about the sea folk
have to be executed!

414
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,375
I can't let Mawari become this

415
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,666
midget Grim Reaper's
next target!

416
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,750
[NAGASUMI] Check it!
This little thing has

417
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,458
48 points of articulation!

418
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,583
It can really move!

419
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,416
[MAWARI] I'll just
keep this between us.

420
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,916
I guess everyone's entitled
to their own hobbies.

421
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,416
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I lost
a good deal of dignity today.

422
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,541
But then again.
I did save a human life,

423
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,875
that has to at least
count for something.

424
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
[SUN] Mawari.

425
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh. Are you
doing okay, too?

426
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,083
Mawari.

427
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,916
Your handling of
those guys was great.

428
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
Really impressive.

429
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,125
I just wish the Seto outfit from
back home was here to see it.

430
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,041
The Seto outfit?

431
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,791
And that knightly
spirit ya got.

432
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,833
I think you and me are gonna
be good friends before long.

433
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,250
Knightly what?

434
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,083
That's not it.

435
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,208
[SUN] Huh?

436
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,250
No, you see. It's
a sense of justice.

437
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,958
[MAWARI] My dad is
the superintendent of the

438
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,833
metropolitan police and someday

439
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,583
I'm going to be
a police officer, too!

440
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,666
Just as good as my father!

441
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,083
[VOICES]
Police Officer's daughter

442
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,666
[SUN] He-he-he's the
s-s-s-superintendent?

443
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
Th-th-the boss
of all the police?

444
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,541
My nemesis!

445
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
Glad we met.
Sun Se--

446
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,458
Take pity on me. Please,
don't send me away.

447
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,291
Mercy!

448
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,375
Uh, Sun,
you really haven't

449
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,791
done anything wrong, you know.

450
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,666
[SUN] Mawari was so
dashing and impressive.

451
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,041
She's amazing!

452
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,333
This is no time to begin
idolizing someone, Miss Sun.

453
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,500
With her being so
close with the fuzz,

454
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,333
we need to be extra careful.

455
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,791
Actually, what we need is to
go back to Seto immediately.

456
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,375
Yer just overreactin'.
There's no need for that.

457
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,625
Besides, we haven't
done anything wrong.

458
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,125
Well, if you're sure.

459
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,333
But if push comes to shove,
I'll be ready to strap

460
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,708
some dynamite to myself and

461
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,000
blow up whatever
needs blowing up.

462
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,166
Now, Maki.

463
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,625
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary,

464
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,291
and ya shouldn't
say stuff like that.

465
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,416
Oh. Okay then,
Miss Sun.

466
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,833
