1
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,317
So what time's the competition?

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,257
I'm pretty sure they open the hall at 3:00,

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,363
and the competition starts up at 3:30.

4
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,162
What? But it's already 3:20.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,073
Crap! We really need to hustle.

6
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:19,039
Chill out, you guys. We're gonna make it.

7
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,092
I'm the fourth one up, so I've got some time.

8
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:21,664
Huh?!

9
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,664
You're cutting it so close.

10
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,727
Whoo-hoo! We just made it!

11
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,140
Way to beat the clock!

12
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,080
Oh.

13
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,500
Here. Have a program.

14
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:17,587
Oh, thank you.

15
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,829
Number 11 got Honorable Mention last year, right?

16
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,271
What about the Audience Award?

17
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,907
I wonder if she'll play up to her ability?

18
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,395
Looks like Mr. Kazama's heading up the panel of judges.

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,075
Good chance to catch his eye.

20
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:31,687
I guess in a place like this,
folks like Kaori are the rock stars.

21
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,625
Is it weird that I'm starting to
get the pregame jitters over here?

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,285
I don't even have to do anything!

23
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,629
Honestly, yeah.

24
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,464
All right, then.

25
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,620
It's about time I went backstage.

26
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:44,596
Break a leg!

27
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,789
When you hear cheering, that's us!

28
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:48,696
Thanks! Later, guys!

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,620
The auditorium's this way, right?

30
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:52,586
Yeah.

31
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:55,910
Huh?

32
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,225
Huh?

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,866
You okay?

34
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,175
Oh. Uh...

35
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,797
yeah. I'm good.

36
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,832
You came here to win.

37
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,628
Huh. I kinda thought it'd be bigger in here.

38
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:32,270
It's a concert hall, dummy, not a stadium.

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,489
Last time I came here was back in
sixth grade when I came to cheer you on.

40
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,913
Forgot what it feels like.

41
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:40,491
The dryness of the air.

42
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,831
The scent of dust.

43
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,005
Oh, hey, those look good.

44
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,080
That's Arima, right?

45
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,788
Look. It's Arima.

46
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,480
Wait. Like, Arima, the pianist?

47
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:54,881
He's way taller now.

48
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,420
Youngest kid to ever win the Saiki Competition, right?

49
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,173
I could have sworn he moved overseas.

50
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,560
So what is he doing here?

51
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,703
Hey, look who's famous.

52
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:06,567
It's pretty crazy how they still remember you, isn't it?

53
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,682
You could have told me we'd be doing this!

54
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,529
Springing it on me is not cool!

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,498
I should have.

56
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:12,898
Hmm?

57
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:16,115
But if you'd known about it, you wouldn't have come.

58
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:20,275
It's not so awful now that you're here. Am I right?

59
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,803
Okay. I get that you're mad at me loud and clear.

60
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,274
Please take your seats.

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,902
We will now begin the preliminary
round of the Towa Music Competition

62
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,420
with the Violin Section for Middle Schoolers.

63
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:13,004
Beethoven, "Violin Sonata Number 9,"

64
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,728
the "Kreutzer."

65
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,773
What the... Asleep already?

66
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:22,835
It's been a while since I
heard a performance in the flesh.

67
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:24,858
Even so...

68
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,596
it's giving me goose bumps.

69
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,856
It's the same song over and over again.

70
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,337
That's the set piece,

71
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,276
and you're the one who dragged me here.

72
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,538
There's a pretty good crowd here, wouldn't you say?

73
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,772
I'm kinda surprised.

74
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:53,951
This competition is new, but it's
starting to pick up steam in these circles.

75
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:55,720
The rules are a bit different, though.

76
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:01,212
Usually at something like this, they'd have them all
play a Bach or a Paganini number in the preliminary round

77
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:02,807
and as a solo, at that,

78
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,040
but in this contest, everyone gets an accompanist.

79
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:07,299
That's pretty rare.

80
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:12,595
The winning violinist gets to play a recital
on a rare Guarneri owned by the organizer.

81
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,619
What's a Guarneri?

82
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,272
And who's Paganini?

83
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,629
He's off tempo.

84
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,097
Not so hot, is he?

85
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,038
Huh?

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,978
Just calm down.

87
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:37,965
You've got this.

88
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:51,766
That's too bad.

89
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,636
And he started off so strong.

90
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,418
Couldn't keep it together in the middle.

91
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,682
He's one of Mr. Sato's students, right?

92
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:58,878
Not a shock.

93
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:02,873
That bow work really took a dive
halfway through. I guess he panicked.

94
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,459
I can look beyond a bit of youthful flailing.

95
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,521
That was raw, but the boy knew what he was doing.

96
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:10,045
His attempt was laudable.

97
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,793
Oh, yes, Mr. Kazama. You're absolutely right.

98
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,569
At least it got interesting after he bombed.

99
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,475
I'm gonna pass out at this rate.

100
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,895
Who's next on the chopping block?

101
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:24,068
Next one up's Kaori.

102
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,716
Hey, stop drooling over there.

103
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,817
Aw, man. I really blew it.

104
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:36,904
Eh?

105
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,319
You look so pretty, Kaori!

106
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,415
You can do it! We believe in you, Kaori!

107
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,357
Time to put these nerves away.

108
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,954
The music I create here...

109
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:07,571
is it going to reach them?

110
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:11,409
Elohim, Essaim.

111
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:15,117
Elohim, Essaim, most humbly I implore you.

112
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,143
She's so cute.

113
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:53,389
Eh?

114
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:56,908
Whoa.

115
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,061
Wait a second.

116
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,862
That is the same song from before. I mean, right?

117
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:03,120
It's the set piece, the Kreutzer, no question, but...

118
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:17,920
Blasphemous.

119
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,562
The tempo and dynamics are abysmal.

120
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,830
Look. Her own accompanist can't even keep up with her.

121
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,795
She's dragged Beethoven into a back-alley brawl.

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,331
It's Beethoven's "Kreutzer," but
this piece no longer belongs to him.

123
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,087
Here and now...

124
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,301
she owns it down to its soul.

125
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:03,360
She's tempestuous and capricious.

126
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,262
I can't read her, but...

127
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,437
This girl...

128
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,762
she's beautiful.

129
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:46,872
Kaori, bravo!

130
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:48,912
That was out of this world, man!

131
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:56,489
Now, that was something else. Takes a lot of
guts to play tug of war with Beethoven like that.

132
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,185
And of course Kazama hated it.

133
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,361
How dare you sully the score?!

134
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,596
This girl is in a league of her own.

135
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:06,960
Huh. How on Earth is she not famous already?

136
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,402
This is amazing. They're still cheering for her.

137
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,579
You'd think this crowd was a full house.

138
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,239
She's gonna win, right?

139
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,005
Huh? Uh...

140
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,837
Brilliant with a bow,

141
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,430
but she won't even place.

142
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,037
This is a competition, after all.

143
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:34,367
I'm sure they docked her a bunch of points.

144
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,461
Not playing the score the way
it's written is a total taboo.

145
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:39,603
This is as far as she's gonna get.

146
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:40,965
But that's stupid!

147
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,853
Look how much everybody loved it.

148
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,199
It'd be one thing if this were a recital,

149
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,543
but it's a contest.

150
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:51,337
But then I don't think she even cares about the contest.

151
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:55,220
How does she look so free while she's performing?

152
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:56,784
Hmm.

153
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,318
We will now take a 15-minute intermission.

154
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,292
Thank you.

155
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,895
That number four was awesome.

156
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,674
Yeah. What was her name again? Kaori Miyazono, right?

157
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,176
Whoever she is, I'm a big fan.

158
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,671
She's a tough act to follow.

159
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:12,977
And so cute.

160
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,377
That's crazy.

161
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,646
All these people are talking about Kaori.

162
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,253
She really hit a home run.

163
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:20,162
Everything before her was a snooze,

164
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:22,149
but I couldn't even blink during her song.

165
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:24,602
You better hope I don't tell her how you were snoring.

166
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,802
I was awake for hers.

167
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,135
Excuse me.

168
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:30,187
These flowers are for you.

169
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:31,229
Please accept them.

170
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,804
Your playing was so beautiful.

171
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,204
Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.

172
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:39,974
Just to let you know, we'll be posting the
results 30 minutes after the final contestant, miss.

173
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,429
Whenever is fine.

174
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:41,795
Uh...

175
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,104
I really don't care about the competition part.

176
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,716
Coming in first is all that matters.

177
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,937
Oh?

178
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:53,838
Kaori! Hey!

179
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:55,132
Hey, Tsubaki!

180
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,481
I gotta run, but thank you so much.

181
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,226
Okay.

182
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,012
The violinist who enchanted us all

183
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,753
comes running towards those who await her,

184
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,960
prancing through the crowd,

185
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,470
laden with flowers.

186
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:20,878
It's like...

187
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,107
a scene straight out of a movie.

188
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,020
That was incredible.

189
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:30,641
You totally rocked up there.

190
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:32,385
Really? Thank you.

191
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,628
Seriously, I mean it.

192
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:35,603
Well, how's Friend A?

193
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:37,794
Hey, guys!

194
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:39,946
What did you think of it?

195
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,404
Uh, how do you mean?

196
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,498
I think I did a pretty good job.

197
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:46,018
It was, you know...

198
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,086
Yeah? Go on.

199
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,355
Honestly, I thought...

200
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,005
I've never seen anybody get flowers before, not like that.

201
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,659
The way those girls came up to you,

202
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:09,796
they... they don't even know you, do they?

203
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:14,495
After you played, they ran out and
bought the first flowers they could find.

204
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,217
They had to.

205
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:21,080
So, yeah, I think you did pretty good today.

206
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,902
Not too shabby, huh?

207
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:33,898
It's a moment pulled straight off of a movie screen.

208
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:39,421
The ingénue, the hero...

209
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,148
and Friend A.

210
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,784
We'll now be posting the names of
everyone who cleared the prelims.

211
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,396
Cool! I see my name!

212
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:49,686
Number eight isn't going on?

213
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,721
Hey, I made it!

214
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:51,932
Dad, get a picture!

215
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,159
Hey, look, I found your name.

216
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,109
The audience's favorite makes it to the second round, too.

217
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,738
Wow!

218
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,637
Watari. What's up?

219
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:32,145
You trying to give me a heart attack?

220
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,878
You weren't in the nurse's office, so I go
looking and find you flopped on the floor?

221
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:37,593
I thought that free throw killed you.

222
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,297
Ooh!

223
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,045
Timeout!

224
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:43,562
Stick it on your head, or drink it. Whatevs.

225
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:44,651
Thanks.

226
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,026
So what are you up to?

227
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,754
Aside from ditching class and screaming bloody murder.

228
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:52,503
Nothing. Just trying to clear my mind, you know?

229
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,543
You're acting pretty weird today,

230
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:56,825
and for you, that's saying something.

231
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,640
Maybe you were laying here, thinking
about some chick you like. Yeah?

232
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:03,731
Huh? What could have given you that idea?

233
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,378
You're a teenager, dude. What
else is worth thinking about?

234
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,858
So was it the fair Miss Kaori, perhaps?

235
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:11,187
Hey, I get it. I almost did a double take myself.

236
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,645
It's not like that, okay?

237
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:13,822
Besides...

238
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:14,353
Huh?

239
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,903
What's the point?

240
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,256
Kousei Arima as the ever-dependable Friend A.

241
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:22,723
She likes you, Watari.

242
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,837
I would never have a chance with a girl like her.

243
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,785
That's got nothing to do with it.

244
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:30,333
Huh?

245
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:34,201
Cute girls have crushes, too,
man, just like the rest of us.

246
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,951
And because she's in love, she's even cuter to you,

247
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,027
so you fall for her,

248
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,187
even knowing it's not gonna happen.

249
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,932
Hearing you talk, I get why
the girls throw themselves at you.

250
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:49,261
Yeah, and I throw myself right back.

251
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,976
I can never be that kind of guy.

252
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:53,951
No chance.

253
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,298
Maybe there isn't,

254
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,811
but I think that's up to the girl to decide.

255
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:03,128
You give really good advice. You know that?

256
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:03,995
I try.

257
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,879
What the hell's your problem, Watari?!
Keiko's crying 'cause of you again!

258
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,119
Calm down, Tsubaki.

259
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,875
Try telling her that! She's a mess!

260
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,688
I was just thinking how I should
ditch practice today and walk Keiko home.

261
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:17,195
See? Problem solved.

262
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:20,150
Maybe your advice isn't so good.

263
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:23,592
He saw right through me, huh?

264
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,214
I'm not myself today.

265
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:28,060
Might as well go home.

266
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,386
Before I know it,

267
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:40,312
under the reds and yellows of the sunset,

268
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:43,927
her song takes root in me and blooms anew...

269
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,759
over and over...

270
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,154
and over again.

271
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,998
And every time I hear it unfurl...

272
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:57,805
all the things my mother left me

273
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,293
just scatter on the wind.

274
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,687
I want to hear her play again,

275
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,167
but then I don't.

276
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:09,619
When you appear...

277
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:14,527
it's what I want

278
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:16,944
and what I dread.

279
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:26,356
This feeling I have, what do they call it?

280
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:28,538
Eh?

281
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:34,938
Maybe I've forgotten or never really knew.

282
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,829
You're Friend A.

283
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,927
You live within a veil of spring.

284
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:50,578
And that's our school uniform,
so I guess you really do go here.

285
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,750
Uh, why are you staring at me?

286
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,453
You were gonna sneak another pic!

287
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,203
Pervert.

288
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:57,688
Honestly, not my plan.

289
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,079
Don't lie! You wanna put it online, huh?

290
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:01,103
What?! No!

291
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,957
Huh. If you did post my picture,

292
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,072
I'd become an Internet sensation overnight.

293
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,251
Cocky much?

294
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,231
No sign of Watari so far.

295
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:10,878
Watari?

296
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,904
I want to surprise him, so I've been waiting around.

297
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,069
I was thinking I should ditch
practice today and walk Keiko home.

298
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,046
He is an elusive one.

299
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,907
Hmm.

300
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,324
How much longer should I give him?

301
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,620
Look, here's the truth.

302
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:32,381
He's still in practice.

303
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:33,607
Yeah.

304
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:37,301
Okay.

305
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,195
Maybe I'll go give the soccer team a peek.

306
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,378
Wait! What?! They... They've got
their summer tournament coming up,

307
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:49,907
so it's not a great time to be barging in on practice.

308
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,588
You know, the more I think about it,
the more it seems like a really bad idea.

309
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,020
How 'bout a rain check?

310
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,346
Hmm. That make sense.

311
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,382
Oh, good.

312
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,481
He won't like me if I bug him.

313
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,187
So, Friend A,

314
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,188
you're gonna be his stand-in.

315
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,073
Huh?
