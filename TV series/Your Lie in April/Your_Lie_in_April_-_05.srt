00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,708
- Eh?

323
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,125
- Well, any day now.
- Uh, what you doing?

324
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,416
- Awaiting my "glad you're
out of the hospital" gift.

325
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,583
- Uh...[chuckles]

326
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,083
- Wait. For reals?!

327
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,125

- You're such a cad!

330
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,458
Watari gave me flowers,
and he's not the one

331
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,208
who torpedoed my performance
at the competition!

332
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,250
The least you could do is get me

333
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,416
a stuffed animal
or some candy or something!

334
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,416
- This is why I hid from you
on the roof!

335
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,375
- Stop being mean to her!
- [sobbing]

336
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,416
- This is why boys are stupid!

337
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,791
- Look, I'm sorry!
Whatever you want, I'll do it!

338
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,333
- Like whatever, whatever?

339
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,375
- Okay.

340
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,958
- Anything?
- Anything.

341
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,375
- All right!
- [girls laugh]

342
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,416
KOUSEI:<i> That was quick.</i>

343
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,708
- What to ask for?

344
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,958
[gasps] I've got it!

345
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,541
You are gonna enter
a piano competition.

346
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,958
- [gasps]

347
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,291
- It's your turn now.

348
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,375
- Ask me for something else.

349
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,666
- But at the recital,
you were awesome.

350
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,166
Are you still afraid?

351
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm gonna tell you
a little secret.

352
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,625
Going onstage to play,

353
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,083
it scares all of us,

354
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,750
'cause maybe you mess up.

355
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,791
Maybe the audience hates you.

356
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,416
Doesn't matter.

357
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,708
You walk out there
like you're 10 feet tall.

358
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,500
Making music
is like a heartbeat,

359
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,458
and without that, you're dead.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,166
- You feel that way, too?

361
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,125
<i>Everything you say and do,</i>

362
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,833

<i>sparkles so brightly.</i>

363
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,666
<i>Sometimes I can't even look.</i>

364
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,583
<i>That's how bright you shine.</i>

365
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,833
I'm a failure.

366
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,208
I left my talent
in a corner to rust.

367
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,375
I don't deserve to play.

368
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,250
YOUNG KOUSEI:<i> I thought</i>
<i>if I did a good enough job</i>

369
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,250
<i>as a pianist, then maybe</i>
<i>you would get better!</i>

370

- [Kaori laughs]
- [gasps]

371
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,083
- You talk like you're
the only one who ever choked.

372
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,166
We're all just faking it,

373
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,375
some of us better than others,

374
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:15,208
but you put your music
on the stand and play anyhow,

375
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,375
'cause that's the way you tell
the most beautiful lie of all.

376
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,958
[laughs]

377
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,375
Be afraid later.

378
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,333
Right now, we're 14.

379
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,083
Let's take a deep breath
and dive in!
