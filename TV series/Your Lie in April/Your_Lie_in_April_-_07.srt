Emi Igawa and Takeshi Aiza,

those two are basically

You can tell
they practice night and day,

He's such a jerk.

He left without looking
at the results,

250
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,000
like he knew he won.

251

he just doesn't care,

doesn't care about us?

That's all the more reason
to command his attention.
