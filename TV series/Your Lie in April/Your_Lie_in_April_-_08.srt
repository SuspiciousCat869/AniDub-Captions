you've received an invitation

Congratulations. You're
finally heading to Europe.

00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:13,875
It'll conflict with the Maihou,

but we can cancel that one.

those chances are?

The Chopin Competition is soon,

16
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,958

exposure before then.

17
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,583
Besides, you won the Maihou
last year, Takeshi.

18
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,250
There's no reason
for you to do this.

19

There's a rumor

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,833
Honorable Mention
at the Kumagai.

169

Third place
at the Tanizaki Festival.

170
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,458
And the other day, she didn't
even make it past the prelims.

- A pleasure to see you,
Ms. Ochiai.

By the way,

Aiza's performance was amazing,

all thanks
to your tutelage, I'm sure.

183

that's kind of you to say.

it's time to shift his focus
to the world stage.

189

can throw off
the girl's equilibrium,

201
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,708
like the way a new pair of shoes
might pinch at her toes,

too incessantly

Her only worthy foe

doesn't pass muster?

Emi doesn't pass muster for him.
