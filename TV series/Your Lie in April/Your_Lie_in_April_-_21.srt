1
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:05,413
No way.

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,543
When I went to go visit her last week, she was fine.

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:11,612
I mean, we talked about shopping.

4
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:15,177
It happened just as we were heading in to see her.

5
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:17,330
Out of nowhere.

6
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:21,033
They got to her in time,

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:23,387
but she's in the ICU right now.

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,782
She'll be okay, though, right?

9
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,429
They don't think that she's gonna...

10
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:30,450
I don't know.

11
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:34,079
After seeing all that, I don't know what to think.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,247
Oh, man.

13
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:37,697
You said we were heading.

14
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,410
Was Kousei with you?

15
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,149
Please.

16
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,662
Please go and save Kousei.

17
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,445
If he breaks again,

18
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,551
we're gonna lose him.

19
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,695
Damn it, Kousei! I know that you're home!

20
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:00,663
I'm coming up!

21
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:03,907
Listen to me!

22
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:19,929
I know you're hurting, but you
need to get your head on straight.

23
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:22,217
That competition is right around the corner!

24
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:30,210
You are gonna practice if I have to drag you!

25
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:35,736
I can't.

26
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,460
I can't do this.

27
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:46,549
Why does it have to end this way?

28
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,608
All I wanted was to play the piano

29
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:55,791
and make my mom better again.

30
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,194
That's all.

31
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,865
I didn't know

32
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,571
I was going to fall in love.

33
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:16,112
I can't save her.

34
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,222
I'm done.

35
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,319
There's nothing left.

36
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:33,790
Ah, look at this cute stationary!

37
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:14,710
Hey.

38
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:23,026
So, yeah, they let me come back here yesterday.

39
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,466
The ICU was a drag.

40
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,120
I'd never been in one before but I don't recommend it.

41
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,022
Everybody's so serious.

42
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:33,138
I'm sorry you had to see that, by the way.

43
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,692
We should have stuck to phone calls, Friend A.

44
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:36,693
Just saying.

45
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,287
Snap out of it!

46
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,467
Hey, what the heck?

47
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:47,672
Don't make a big deal about
coming if you're gonna be all gloomy!

48
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,765
What are you trying to do? Make me even sicker?

49
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,048
Canaeles! You and me on the roof!

50
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,328
But it's cold out.

51
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,588
I'll steal your coat.

52
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,873
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

53
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,311
One fat joke and you're going down the stairs.

54
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,182
Just don't eat more of the caneles.

55
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:19,652
She's light. Very light.

56
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:24,655
I always used to tell myself she was going to be fine.

57
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:26,701
She'd weathered the worst of it.

58
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:32,579
She was strong but now I... I don't know.

59
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,846
She loves stuffed animals and has a sweet tooth.

60
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:40,980
She's fragile. I see that now.

61
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,377
God, I'm a moron.

62
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,100
Ah!

63
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:52,808
It's snowing!

64
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,075
Are you playing the piano?

65
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,027
No, I'm not.

66
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,405
Of course you're not.

67
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,057
You're too busy moping, huh?

68
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,955
I just can't do it.

69
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,763
The people I love, they keep on leaving me.

70
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:35,997
Music just brings to mind what I've lost.

71
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,587
And now I'm gonna be alone.

72
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:46,500
But you have me.

73
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,752
You know that, right?

74
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:58,352
There's a chance they can fix me.

75
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:01,236
The surgery's set for the 18th.

76
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,607
Nobody knows if it'll work,

77
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,848
but they said there's a chance, so I'm taking it.

78
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,502
Just so you know,

79
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,172
it's your fault I'm going through with this.

80
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,317
Your fault that I'm struggling to live.

81
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,847
Why I don't have the good sense to give up.

82
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,338
Why I dream.

83
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:22,082
The moments we share,

84
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,192
I' hanging onto them

85
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,434
for as long as I can.

86
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,537
You should fight, too. Don't you think?

87
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,020
That's what being a musician is all about.

88
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,909
In a way, it's life or death
every time we step out on stage.

89
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,726
But I haven't touched the piano in over a week.

90
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:46,736
I'm rusty.

91
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,171
You were rusty when we played, too.

92
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,942
At least I was playing a bit
for my part time job back then.

93
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,028
Whatever I do now is trash.

94
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,271
It would take a miracle. What's the point?

95
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,016
You're looking down again.

96
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,715
There, you see?

97
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,127
Getting a miracle can be a cinch.

98
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:23,663
Whoa!

99
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:30,055
In the same way that you have me,

100
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,088
I have you, too.

101
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,620
You like to drink milk

102
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,875
'cause it washes down all those sweets.

103
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,955
What else do you like, though?

104
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,118
Do you collect stuff?

105
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,740
Bugs or stamps or anything?

106
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:46,060
Do you like anime?

107
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,367
So much that I don't know about you.

108
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,970
I envy Tsubaki for having all of the answers.

109
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,991
I want to ask you so many things.

110
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,819
I'm scared.

111
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,722
I don't wanna die.

112
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:04,509
Kousei!

113
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,290
Don't go! Don't leave me all alone!

114
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:16,903
I'm a moron.

115
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,582
She's tempestuous and capricious.

116
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,361
I can't read her,

117
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:28,137
but this girl is beautiful.

118
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:34,609
A vision of spring.

119
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:36,900
Friend in snow.

120
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,127
We're going to start the anesthesia.

121
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,698
Just breathe deeply.

122
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,241
There's this quote from the "Peanuts."

123
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:13,374
"We all need someone to kiss us good‐bye."

124
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,155
Her vitals are holding steady.

125
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,228
Patient is anesthetized.

126
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,983
Very good. Let's begin.

127
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,231
Bravo!

128
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,482
You're incredible!

129
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:49,586
Emi, that performance was sublime!

130
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,123
How does someone play like that?

131
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:55,838
Takeshi's piece blew the others out of the water,

132
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,063
but Emi's song was every bit as good.

133
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,745
I see.

134
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,264
She's further along,

135
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,436
but we're both on the same path.

136
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,126
Splendid work.

137
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,302
I didn't think Ochiai's girl would rise to the challenge.

138
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:11,783
Technically the two are neck and neck.

139
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:14,977
Spare me the gloating, you witch.

140
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,082
These finals are riveting.

141
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,946
Two prodigies in the same district?

142
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,345
I wonder which one's gonna win?

143
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,051
You were dazzled by those amateurs?

144
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,042
The greatest pianist of them
all has yet to grace the stage.

145
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,365
Hold on. Isn't that...

146
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,250
Yeah.

147
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,714
I'll give the old gal this.

148
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,799
Ochiai's great at lighting a
fire under the ass of her kids.

149
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:36,980
Please, Ms. Seto,

150
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:39,147
how is Arima doing back there?

151
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:42,305
He's a damn mess.

152
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,073
I was able to drag him down here.

153
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,713
Who knows if he can play?

154
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,310
It's two years ago all over again.

155
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:52,534
He might be done with the piano,

156
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,391
not just today but for the rest of his life.

157
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,537
Help me! Please!

158
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,028
Help me, anybody!

159
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,755
Please just let him get through it.

160
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:04,917
Very good.

161
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,077
Marvelous.

162
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,724
See that, you two?

163
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,196
Hey, what's wrong?

164
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,020
You look terrible.

165
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,322
I can get you something for your stomach,
if that's what's bothering you, Arima.

166
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,203
He might just be getting focused.

167
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,071
Huh? I guess,

168
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,119
but he looks so bad.

169
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,499
I gotta play.

170
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,974
I gotta play. I gotta play.

171
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,372
I gotta play.

172
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:40,632
Arima's turn is coming.

173
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:41,654
At last!

174
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,109
That boy is amazing.

175
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,489
I'm waiting for this.

176
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:46,062
I hear that he's better than ever.

177
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,552
Number 23, Kousei Arima.

178
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:50,876
You're the next one up,

179
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,960
so please take your place in the wings.

180
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:58,090
Hold on, man! Are you good to go on?

181
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,160
Uh‐huh. I'll be fine.

182
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:01,726
Don't worry about me.

183
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:02,866
What?

184
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,512
Your face is white as a sheet.

185
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,236
You can't compete in this condition.

186
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,318
We need to get you to a doctor.

187
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:12,643
Sorry, but I've gotta play

188
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,232
because I'm a pianist.

189
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,247
I made a promise.

190
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:26,221
It's Arima!

191
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,292
Here he comes.

192
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:29,172
He's so cool.

193
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,996
I hope he doesn't faint on the way to the piano.

194
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:55,913
I'm making you remember things better left forgotten.

195
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,147
I'm a violinist who can't hold her bow anymore.

196
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,258
I'm useless!

197
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,182
I'll never forget about us,

198
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,789
no matter what happens.

199
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:06,086
I've gotta play.

200
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,340
All you have to do is forget about me.

201
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,413
Just press the reset button in your mind.

202
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,450
I've gotta play.

203
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,958
You'd be happier if we had never met, huh?

204
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,912
I've gotta play.

205
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,722
I've got to because I'm a pianist.

206
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:26,462
Arima!

207
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,622
Come on, kid!

208
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:29,762
Is he cracking?

209
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:30,510
It's the pressure.

210
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:31,994
But it's Arima.

211
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,954
You're looking down again.

212
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,908
Tsubaki, you dummy.

213
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,827
We are so not with her.

214
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:52,693
Tsubaki, I see you.

215
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,772
All of you.

216
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,245
You're all here with me.

217
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,482
This isn't just pesante.

218
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,582
It's so deep. So unhurried.

219
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,350
Such a rich tone for one so young.

220
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,867
One of Chopin's loneliest pieces.

221
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:01,894
Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, Opus 23.

222
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,578
Like a whispered word,

223
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:28,964
or loving touch,

224
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,827
it manifests so gently,

225
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,429
yet it's fraught with true sorrow.

226
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,212
Thinking about some chick you like, yeah?

227
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,858
You bet I am.

228
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,842
For now it's enough that you play what you feel.

229
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,144
But my heart is a sinking ship.

230
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,727
What a cliché.

231
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,807
That doesn't mean it's not true, though.

232
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:55,820
Are you gonna play that song all night,
or are you gonna comfort me already?

233
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,199
Guess it can't be helped.

234
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:59,304
I'm not good with words.

235
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:04,465
Everyone, the reason I'm here right now

236
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,944
is because I had you.

237
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,920
The people who play a part in my life,

238
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,671
the people who make my life fuller,

239
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,055
I can't let them down.

240
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,563
Maybe it's because all three of us are pianists.

241
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,578
We gotta say it with music.

242
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,161
Yeah, you're right.

243
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:24,701
That's how it is.

244
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,691
Whether you're sad or hurt or empty,

245
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,200
you have to keep playing,

246
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,686
'cause you're a musician.

247
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,585
Sure feels like I'm winging it.

248
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,922
We're totally winging it,

249
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:36,886
but we'll be great because we're just that awesome!

250
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,680
And so I play.

251
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:46,586
Not because it haunts me, but because I want to.

252
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:49,975
Heart and soul, I'm a pianist.

253
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:51,315
A musician.

254
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:53,275
You taught me that.

255
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:57,955
Amazing.

256
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:00,621
Arima's playing is incredible.

257
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:04,549
The music pouring out of him, out of his life itself,

258
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:07,399
it's sparkling with colors I can't even name!

259
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:14,368
He summons this song with all the contents of his heart.

260
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:19,085
Bearing his soul before the frost.
