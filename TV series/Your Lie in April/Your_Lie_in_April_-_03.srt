<i>What do I say</i>

324
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,208
<i>to make her give up on me?</i>

325
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,708
- There's a difference,
you know?

326
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,041
It's not that you can't play.
You just won't.

327
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,250
You say
you can't hear the piano,

328
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,416
but all I hear is an excuse
for you to run away.

329
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,041
- [sighs]

330
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,666
When I play...

331
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,250
I feel...

332
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,791
horrible.

333
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,583
[water flowing]

334
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,291
<i>It feels like...</i>

335
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,708
<i>I'm at the bottom</i>
<i>of a dark sea...</i>

336
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,375

337
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,875
<i>no light, no sound.</i>

338
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,750
CAT:<i> It must have been a relief</i>

339
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,750
<i>realizing the notes</i>
<i>had forsaken you.</i>

340
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,916
<i>Finally you had an excuse.</i>

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,041
<i>You never had to set foot</i>
<i>onstage ever again.</i>

342
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:48,750
<i>No great loss.</i>

343
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,375
<i>You're no Beethoven.</i>

344
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,458
KOUSEI:<i> Help me, please.</i>

345
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,541
[crying]<i> I can't hear anything.</i>

346
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,958
MAN:<i> Huh.</i>
<i>Bad case of stage fright?</i>

347
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,458
-<i> Why isn't he playing anymore?</i>

348
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,625
<i>- Did he forget how to play?</i>
<i>- What a weird kid.</i>

349
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,125
KOUSEI:<i> Somebody...</i>

350
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:03,916
-<i> Arima's self-destructed.</i>

351
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,541
-<i> Lucky for the others, huh?</i>

352
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,583
-<i> It's over for him.</i>
<i>-</i> KOUSEI:<i> ...help me.</i>

353
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,500
<i>- He cracked</i>
<i>under the pressure.</i>

354
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,291
-<i> Mom.</i>

355
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,666
<i>And now she wants me</i>
<i>to go back down</i>

356
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,416
<i>to the bottom of the ocean.</i>

357
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,916
- You'll have me this time.

358
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,833
- I know you can't hear
your own notes

359
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,666
and that you're
all kinds of rusty.

360
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,500
I know all of that.

361
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,375
And I want you with me anyway.

362
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,000
- [gasps]
- Maybe we'd bomb out there.

363
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,791
Maybe we step off that stage
in defeat,

364
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,541
but we are gonna play

365
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,833
If there's a crowd
and a chance to play...

366
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,500
- Kousei!
- I'm taking it.

367
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,166
- Kousei!

368
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,791
KAORI: I'll give it
everything I've got,

369
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:52,750
and the people who hear it,
they'll never forget me.

370
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,250
Part of me will echo
in their hearts forever.

371
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,166
I think those moments
are why I'm alive.

372
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,875
I was put on this Earth
to make music,

373
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,708
and so were you.

374
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,125
- [gasps]

375
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,416
- So, please, do it for me.

376
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,708
Say that you'll be
my accompanist.

377
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,333
- Huh? But...

378
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,458
I just...

379
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,333
- Believe in me,

380
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,708
even a tiny bit.

381
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,083
[crying]

382
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,541
You don't know
how close I am right now

383
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,458
to just losing heart.

384

<i>Impossible or not...</i>

00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,583
<i>that's up to the girl</i>
<i>to decide.</i>

388
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,416
I'll do it.

389
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,916
I'll be your accompanist.

390

No promises
I'll be good, though.

- [gasps]

394
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,958
Hmm.

395
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,958
- [both yell]
- [both gasp]

396
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,125
- Attack!
- Attack!

397
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,208
- Leaving Kaori
high and dry like this?!

398
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,458
- You keep making trouble
for that gorgeous girl,

399
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,333
and I'm gonna bring
the hurt, dude!

400
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,333
- If we run,
we can be there in 20!

401
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,458
- Run that far?

402
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,500
I'll die on top of the piano.

403
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,416
- Hmph. Check it out.

404
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Watari for the save.

405
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,625
- Onward, ho! [laughs]

406
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,541
[Kousei screaming]

407
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,833
- Have you even
played the song together,

408
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,000
or are you winging it?

409
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,541
- We're totally winging it!

410
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,125
But we'll be great,
because we're just that awesome!

411
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,000
- You got
a soccer player up here.

412
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,166
You need time to rehearse,
I'll make it happen.

413

- Shouldn't you two
be in class right now?

414
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,791
And whose bikes
are these, anyway?

415

WATARI: Don't sweat
the small stuff. Am I right?
