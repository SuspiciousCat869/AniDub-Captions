00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
I am Reinbach Jamil.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
Reinhart is my son.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Which of course means
I was the previous duke.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
I'm Reinhart's wife,
Elise Jamil.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
I've heard good things.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
Thank you for being
there for my husband

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
and his men the other day.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
Happy to be of help.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
And lastly,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
I'd like to introduce
our daughter.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.342 position:50% align:center
My name is Eliaria Jamil.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
Pleasure to meet you.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
And you are?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you all
coming to visit,

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
but I don't have the means
to offer the proper hospitality.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH laughs]

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.069 position:50% align:center
Well, we did come unannounced.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.280 position:50% align:center
In this situation, I think
we're the ones at fault.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
You know,

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
I heard you were
a tamer who managed

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
to contract a slime or two.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
But I believe that was
an understatement.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
There's even more.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
Or seems like it.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
They've split since
you were last here.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
Can they all fit
inside your house?

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.047 position:50% align:center
Eventually, they learned how to.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
How to what?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
Here. I'll show you.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! Combine!

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
As you can see, a group of over
100 slimes has the power

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
to join together if they're
of the same type.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
They also have this
ability that allows me

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
to conserve space and food.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
I dubbed that handy
little trick "minimize."

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Um... What?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
That slime is gigantic!

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
It's great!

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
That's insane!

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
You really tamed
a slime that big?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Well, uh...

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
If that's what you're saying,
you would be the first

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
person in history
to accomplish that feat!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
I would?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
As far as I know, yes!

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
I didn't think Taming Contracts
were even effective

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
on big slimes!

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
Um, thing is, it's more
than one, though.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
It looks like there's
only one core,

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
but it's actually over 100
separate cores merged together.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Making 100 contracts
at the same time?

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
That would be quite
the feat to accomplish.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
Taming them individually
and then merging them

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
is different.
And here's the proof!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
Well done!

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
You single-handedly
figured out a mystery

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
that's baffled tamers for
as long as I can remember!

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] Madam.
Do contain yourself, please.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
I believe you may be
scaring Mister Ryoma.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
Oh! Please forgive me!

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
Nah. Nothing to forgive.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
But... My word.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Taming over 100 slimes
is quite impressive

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
in its own right.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
I am simply amazed, is all.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's true.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
I never thought this
mystery would be solved

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
in my lifetime, let alone that
I would witness it firsthand.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Join the Tamers' Guild!

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
Then present what you've found!

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That's right.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
There's an organization in
Seilfall that collects

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
this type of info.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
Anyway, um...

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
You've been on your
feet long enough.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
Please come in
and take a load off.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
Sure. Sounds good. Thank you.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
Now, "minimize!"

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Right, then. Your slimes.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
They're so amazing they
nearly made me forget

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
why we came.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
We're here to give a
token of our gratitude.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
I mean no offense,
but I noticed you don't have

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
a clock in your possession.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Well, yeah, but...

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
No buts! Just take it, kid!

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
You gave me time by saving me.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
Now let me return the favor!

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
You're acting like you're
the one giving it to him.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
I'm just grateful is all.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
It's such a kindhearted gift.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
I'll be sure to treasure it.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] I'm happy to hear it,
though there is another

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
reason we came
to the forest today.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
We, the Jamil family,
have all been tamers

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
for many generations!

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
The time has come for me
to catch and tame

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
my very first familiar,

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
and I'd like that
creature to be a slime!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
Well, then, you've come
to the right place.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
Did you find one yet?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
We searched on our way here,
but we didn't see any.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
Here!

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
Slimes often go to
this watering hole

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
when they need
something to drink.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Looks like my path is set.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
Um... Question!

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
I still haven't decided
on what kind of slime

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
I want to capture.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
I'm fairly well versed
in sticky slimes,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
acid slimes, poison slimes,
and healing slimes

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
because they're documented
in books that I've read.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
But I've never seen the other
two types you have before.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
I confess that I'm
rather intrigued.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
What variety of slime are they?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] This one here
is a scavenger slime.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
Scavenger. Got it.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
Their diet consists of
excrement and trash.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
And they eliminate bad smells.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
The stuff that they eat
becomes fertilizer!

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Who knew such
a creature existed?

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
Not me. I had no idea.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
Next up is the cleaner slime.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
These little guys are
all about cleansing.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
How do they work?

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
Let me show you!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
This here is a loincloth I
got from a goblin I defeated.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
Gross.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
What purpose could
that possibly serve?

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You'll see.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
It's like a washing machine,
but slimy.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
It looks like a completely
different loincloth!

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
Goblin grime is among
the most difficult stains

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
to clean in the whole world!

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
But it's spotless!

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
So what you're saying is,
these slimes eat dirt

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
like the other ones eat garbage.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You got it.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
Cleansing's kinda
the same as eating.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
In fact, if it's not dirty,
they don't want anything

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
to do with it.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
What in the world?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
That didn't hurt one bit.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're unharmed?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Positive.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
This little guy wouldn't
even eat animal meat

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
unless I told it to.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
More and more surprises. Wow.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
I was so afraid you'd get hurt.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
Please don't scare us
like that again.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
I think the cleaner slime
is the slime for me!

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
It'll make a perfect familiar!

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
I'm absolutely sure of it!

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They're great.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
So tell me.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
How exactly do you
pick them out?

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
Is there some kind of trick?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
How do I know it'll evolve
into the one I want?

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
Um... Well, uh...

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
Can't say. Since you're a lady.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] That's it.
That's how it evolves.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
Who would've guessed?

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
I see why you were
embarrassed to share.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
I doubt women would talk
about their bath water either.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll do the honors, then.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
Hey, ladies!

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
Wait till you hear this!

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
So what is it I need to do?

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Take a bath!

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
But scrape the ring
of filth from the tub,

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
because you're gonna
need to use it as bait!

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ah. Could he be any more blunt?

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
I swear. Your tactlessness
knows no bounds.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
Laugh it up.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
So... it's true.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
To attract the slime
that you want,

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
you would literally have to
use the sweat off your back.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
Though I never would've thought
it had a trait like that.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Oh, don't apologize.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
It's not your fault,
Mister Ryoma.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
These slimes.
They're interesting. Sure.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
But I still want one!

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Maybe one of your
guards can help you out.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
No, that won't do.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
I chose to become a tamer, so...

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who has
to put in the work!

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
You moron!

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Doing everything
by yourself isn't always

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
the best way to go about it.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
But the very first step
of my journey

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
should be mine to take alone!

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
Okay. It's your choice to make.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
I choose to do it!

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
That slime's as good as mine!

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
Look. I'm ready to go.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
Good luck!
We're rooting for you!

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I'm back!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Everyone say hello to
my very first familiar!

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
I'll always treasure him!

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy for you.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] By the Grace of the--
wait, what'd you say?

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
--[RYOMA] I abbreviated.
--[ELIARIA] Ah, I see!

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
--[RYOMA] Enjoy the break?
--[ELIARIA] Hope so!

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA, RYOMA]
Let's get back to it!

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Makes me think
about my first slime.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
He was every bit as sluggish
as he was precious,

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
but that just made
him more memorable.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
Li'l Tabuchi.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
He reminded me of
a younger colleague

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
I used to work with,
so that's who I wound up

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
naming him after.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
Although neither the slime nor
the human are here now.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
I sincerely hope both
of them are living

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
their best lives
in some other world.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Ryoma. Tell me.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
Do you intend to keep
living here by yourself?

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well...

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I haven't decided.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Staying and moving both
have pros and cons.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH]
Here's a third option for you.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
How would you feel about
joining us on our trip?

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
Trip?

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
We're actually in
the midst of a journey

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
to a town called Gimul.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
We'll be staying there
for quite some time.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to come
with us and return here

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
whenever the mood strikes you.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Huh. Let's see.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
Should I leave the forest
and go someplace new?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
I can't even remember
the last time I took a trip.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
Um... Hey. Mister Ryoma?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
I'm like you.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
I'd never been on
a trip before now.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
Never been to this forest.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
I was so nervous
when we left the town.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
In fact... I'm still nervous.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
But, I've seen so many
new and amazing things

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
along the way.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
I even made a friend.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
I also met you.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
All because I left my home.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
I know, every worst-case
scenario is probably

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
rushing through your mind now.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Although there's lots of
bad things in the world,

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
there's lots of good, too!

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
And those things make
the risk worthwhile!

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
Thank you for saying that.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
Such wise words.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
I would like to see
the rest of the world.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
I don't wish to be
a burden to you all,

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.849 position:50% align:center
but I think I'll go ahead
and take you up on

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
your offer.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
You will? That's wonderful!

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
I'll say.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Yay! I'm so glad!

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.565 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Good!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
Since you're coming with us now,

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
we should help you
prepare for the trek.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
You can leave your
belongings with Sebas

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
and his Item Box.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
Oh. No need for that.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
I'll just use my own
Item Box spell.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
You mean you actually
have that skill?

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
Is that weird, or...?

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
It's basic magic, but it
belongs to a higher element.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
What makes it impressive
is that you know it

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
at such a young age.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I had no clue.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
Hey. So!

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
If you have questions
about magic,

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you anything you want!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
I promise to answer
to the best of my ability!

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
She's teaching me
about magic as well,

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
which means that we'll
be learning together!

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
I've lived in this world
for three years,

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
but the only things
I know about it

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
are what the gods
wrote in that manual.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
I can learn some street
smarts and common sense

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
from these people.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
How lucky am I to have met them.

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
That night...

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
I took every possession
in my little cave house

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
and stuffed them
into my Item Box.

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
I took fur from
animals I'd hunted.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
Equipment from thieves
who'd made the mistake

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
of messing with me.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
I've built up a fairly sizable
collection in the past

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
three years.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
And that's everything. Almost.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you guys
probably already know this,

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
but I'm about to embark
on my first journey

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
in this world.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure when I'll be back,

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
so I'm taking everything
I own with me.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
And if I don't return here,
I'll make another statue

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
wherever I end up.

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
A town.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
Sure sounds exciting, huh?

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
The next morning came quickly.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
I had my affairs in order
and was ready to go.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
Locked and secured.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH]
Then, shall we?

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
Our journey has just begun!

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
And with that, I took my first
step in a new direction,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
and it actually
felt pretty good.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Mister Sebas is unbelievable!

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
He has living animals as
well as inanimate objects

00:15:58.708 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
in there!

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that's the
intermediate space magic,

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
Dimension Home.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Question!

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
I know you have Earth and Space,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.598 position:50% align:center
but do you also have
Water and Fire elements

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
along with those two?

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
My grandmother told me I
have control of all elements.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
And in addition to those,
you use barrier

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
and taming magic as well?

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
Be mindful that those who
have all the elements

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
can wind up being
a master of none.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
I will, thanks.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
Did something I just said
strike you as amusing?

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Hmm?

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
You were smiling to yourself.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
Ah. It's just...

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
My grandmother had said
the exact same thing

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
to me before...

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
That was back when
I was first trying my hand

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
at some healing magic
and alchemy.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
You've tried alchemy, eh?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
Now that's a rare one
to show an interest in.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Is it really that uncommon
of a practice?

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH]
Nowadays, yes.

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
You don't see it often.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
Alchemists tend to keep
to themselves and have

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
a disturbing image
associated with them.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
So then, what kind of alchemy
did you work on?

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
In truth, not much.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
The only thing I pulled off
was removing mineral poisons

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
from rock salt
to make it edible.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
That was it, though.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
You just continue to amaze me.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
Oh. Do I, now?

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
I feel like they praise every
single thing that I do.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
The sooner I learn the common
sense of this world,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
the better.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
Good.
They look as happy as I feel.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I took this first step.

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
Over the next few days,
we traveled until nightfall

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
and set up camp
wherever we had to stop.

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lie, it was
surprisingly comfortable.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES sneezes]

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
We hardly ever get such
a heavy downpour

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
around this time of year.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
It's making me quite chilly.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
Madam. Take this.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
So thoughtful. Thank you.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
And what about you? Cold?

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
No. I'm just fine.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
Um... Thanks for
breaking my fall.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
What did they stop for?

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL] Duke Reinhart!
There's a problem!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
No way we're getting around
a landslide like that.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
Is there?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
Not unless we took
a huge detour.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
At least three more days.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
Three more days?

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
we were told this area

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
happens to be a hotspot
for thieves to attack.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
That's why we should
try and get through here

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
as quickly as possible.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll have to
unblock it with magic, then.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
A landslide.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay
if I step outside?

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
I don't see why not.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
What is it you're going to do?

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
Help. Or at least try
to help, if I can.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
It's my raincoat.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
It's great for repelling water
since it has a layer

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
of sticky solution from a slime!

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
The adhesive properties
of sticky slime solution

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
were all I knew.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Just when I think
I've gotten used to

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
your surprising talents,
you go and do something

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
like that.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
It's mind boggling.

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
This shouldn't take too long.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Please be careful
out there, okay?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Do you think that
coat of his has any

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
commercial potential?

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely
willing to find out!

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Would Mister Ryoma be
able to profit from that?

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
But of course!

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
Once we get to town,

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
perhaps we should
introduce him to Serge

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
at the Morgan Trading Company.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
Use Break Rock to crush up
the boulders and larger debris.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
Then use Rock to consolidate
the dirt into manageable sizes,

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
you understand?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
[JILL]
It sounds simple enough.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Energy within.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
Envelop these men and shield
them from this downpour.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
"Rain Block."

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
What the--?

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
[ZEPH]
Where'd that barrier come from?

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
Who cast this?

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
Ryoma!

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES whistles]

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot!

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad we bumped
into you that day!

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
Me, too.
And I have an idea.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's hear it.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
I overheard your plan
to cast those earth magics

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
separately, but...

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
There's combination magic
based on those two

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
called "Create Block."

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
Using that would
be more efficient.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
Okay, what do we do?

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
I'll just show you.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier to demonstrate
than to explain it verbally.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Focus and Create Block.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Whoa.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
Just like this.

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Imagine casting magic
on the rocks and dirt

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
at the same time.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
If you can use
"Break Rock" and "Rock,"

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
you should be able
to do this, too.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
You don't say!

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
Let's test it out!

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA sighs]

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
We can finally get through.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] I didn't expect
it to go so quickly.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
We are in your debt yet again.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ah...

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:43.261 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ryoma! I'm so proud!

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] You'll get mud
on your clean clothes!

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
A little dirt doesn't hurt!

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I can't breathe.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You're fine.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] As draining as that
was, I still came out of it

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
feeling happy.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
I like being able
to help these people.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.071 position:50% align:center
Because it makes me feel good.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
It was smooth sailing--

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
well, riding for the next three
days of our journey.

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
Gimul, the mining town!

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
We're here!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.209 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It'd been a long time
coming, but I finally arrived

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:15.877 position:50% align:center
at my first town in this world.
