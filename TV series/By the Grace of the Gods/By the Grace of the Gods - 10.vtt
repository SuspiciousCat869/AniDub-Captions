00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:09.759 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
Thank you for coming.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.386 position:50% align:center
Though, I should apologize
for not giving you

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.929 position:50% align:center
very much notice.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
How's the Bamboo
Forest Laundry doing,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.849 position:50% align:center
by the way?

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
Good!

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
Actually, I've been meaning
to say thank you.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
You're the one who introduced
the Norad siblings

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
to me, after all.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
They're great!

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
I've hired a few
other employees, too,

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
so the shop runs
with or without me.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
Ah! Smart move!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
Glad it's going well!

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel like
it's going a little too well,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50% align:center
you know?

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
And it's about to get even
better because I have

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
yet another business
proposition for you.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
[SERGE] You're currently
producing a steady supply

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
of ingots and
sticky slime string,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
but how difficult
would it be to include

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
a hefty amount of
waterproof fabric

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
to your next delivery, hmm?

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
What for?

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
Mister Ryoma.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
By any chance,
have you been informed

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.722 position:50% align:center
of the upcoming
grell frog outbreak?

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I have, actually

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
[SERGE] They're used for sturdy
armor and strong medicine,

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
so you can imagine how
many people hunt them.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
Rest assured that when
the outbreak season

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
finally arrives,
every single adventurer

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
in Gimul will be
out on that lake.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
Which is why commodities
such as waterproof

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
garments and waders
would sell remarkably well

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
during a special
event like this!

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd wager that they would!

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
I'll start making them
as soon as I can.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
[SERGE chuckles]
You are amazing!

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.045 position:50% align:center
Working with you
is such an honor!

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA chuckles]

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] What's that
one eating over there?

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
Iron powder.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
Well, I hypothesize that it
will evolve into a metal slime

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
if I continue to feed it iron,

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
so think of it as another
of my experiments.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
How fascinating.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
Are you going to the mines
to make the fabric

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
that Mister Serge asked you to?

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
I am!

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
It's nice 'cause there aren't
many distractions there.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Can I tag along?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
Having no distractions
would help me as well!

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
Sure, I guess you can come.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
But why do you want to?

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh. For violin practice, huh?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
I figured I could practice
here to my heart's content

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
without bothering anyone.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I didn't even know you
were a musician until now.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
This for a recital?

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
Remember the limour birds
we told you about

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
a few days ago?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
How they flock to
the lake at one time?

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
Well, if I want to tame them,
I have to play music for them.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
It's essential!

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
That's cool.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
While their melodies
are absolutely beautiful,

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
they use those same
songs to communicate

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
with and identify each other.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
So if the limour birds
like the music I play,

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
it'll make it easier for
them to accept a taming

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
contract with me.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
Ahh. I had no idea.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
I'll practice as much as I can!

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
So. Please.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
Go and work on your
fabric while I stay here

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
and work on my music!

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Good plan.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
Guys. Let's get
to work, too, 'kay?

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
You did great, Mister Ryoma!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
You, too!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, if anyone did
a great job, it's you!

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
So great, I feel like you
should be rewarded somehow.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
And I know just the thing.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
You mean the doll?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I do.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
So, you'll make it
right here and now?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
Go, Create Block.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
Break Rock.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Playing Clay.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
So far, so good.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
Now for the details.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Whaddya think?

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
She's just like me!

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
I can't describe how
wonderful this is!

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
I love her already!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
My mini-me!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
Ah! Looks just like me!

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
And I have one as well!

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] There's me, Sebas,
Araune, Lilian. Everyone!

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
Extraordinarily exquisite work.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
Your craftsmanship is as
flawless as it's ever been!

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
You're too kind.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad you like them.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
What's not to like about them?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
It's a very thoughtful gift!

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
I'm flattered to the point
where I almost feel

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
embarrassed about it.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Hey, Elia. How about this?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
Take all of them with
you when you leave

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
for school.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
That's a terrific idea!

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
If you have us with you,
you won't be so lonely.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's true. But...

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
The collection is shy
of one doll in particular.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
You mean me?

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I do.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay if
I took you away with me

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
to school?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
Hmm. [laughs]

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
Sure. Why not?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA giggles]

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The next day, I decided
to check in with the shop.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
Next in line!

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
Hi, how are you doing today?

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
I'm great now!

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
[FINA] Thank you!
Please come again!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Number eight is ready! This way.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Since everything was
operating smoothly without me,

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
I went to the mines.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
I just have to wait
for it to dry.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
But I can't leave here.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
What's something productive
I can do while I wait?

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
I know!
Haven't fought in a while.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
And I don't want you slimes
getting rusty on me!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
Nice! Your form's lookin'
better than ever!

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
All right! Keep it up, you guys!

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
I think I'll do a little
training exercise of my own.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
You ready? Let's go!

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA yells]

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Physical Attacks
aren't gonna work on you!

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
Good one!

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
Stay on the offensive, big guy!

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
Don't let up!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
Pretend like you're holding
the enemy down right there!

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA yells]

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA sighs]

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
What a workout!

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
Do you think those
sheets are dry by now?

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
Evolution?

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
It worked!

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
You're heavy like
the other metal slime,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
but you kinda seem
different somehow.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
Monster Appraisal.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
An iron slime?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
Iron. I see.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's all
you've been eating,

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
so it makes perfect sense.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
But I thought iron
was the main thing

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
metal slimes ate, too.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Appraisal.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
Substance comprised of iron
oxide and aluminum oxide.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
I get it!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
If you eat lots
of different metals,

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
you become a metal slime.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
However, if the only
thing you eat is iron,

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
you become an iron slime!

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
Now I know the secret to
your evolutionary process!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Another great day's work.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
I'm proud of you!

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hi.
I didn't know you were here.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
I only just arrived.
That's why.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
I overheard you talking
to the cleaner slimes

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
and thanking them for
all of the hard work

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
they put in.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
Everyone should try
and follow their example.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think you
already do that, Miss Fina.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
[FINA]
What's wrong?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
They split in two!

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That they did.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
Which means they'll
be twice as efficient

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
as they were before.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
Oh, no way! That's great!

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So work like they do,
but not to the point

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
where you split in half.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone.
What's with the huddle?

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Hello, Manager.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
We're just looking at sales.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
Were we slower than usual?

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Not at all.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Take a look.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
We tripled our profits? How?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
What caused such a rapid
spike in our sales?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
There's the fact we had
a big morning rush.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
Word's definitely
been getting around.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
We had blacksmiths and
carpenters stop by.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
And then some iron
foundry workers too.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
Every last one of them
was blown away

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
by how clean their clothes were!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
We're seeing a lot of
individual guests as well!

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
This place is the best!

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You guys. This is nuts.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
But I'm grateful it's happening.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
Just like I'm grateful
for all of you.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
We succeeded because
we had a team

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
that made sure we succeeded!

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
Thanks, everyone!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
You realize, you're thanking
us for doing the jobs

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
you hired us to do.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Jobs we want to do.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
It makes me happy to
hear you like your jobs.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
That said.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
If there's anything
I can do to make them

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
even better,
don't hesitate to let me know.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Even better than this?

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
I mean we're pretty
good as we are.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
You've gone to great lengths
to ensure our work

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
environment is comfortable.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
It's so fun I feel like we
might as well be at a party!

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
Well, that's great to hear.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
I completely forgot
about holidays!

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
How can they enjoy their jobs
if they're never away from them?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
[REPA] I've come from the
bureau of labor standards.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
A very big complaint
was filed against you

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
by one of your employees.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I've created an
exploitative workplace!

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
It's like all of the color
suddenly drained

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
from your face.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I'm very sorry.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
I totally spaced on
scheduling proper time off

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
for you on holidays!

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
Holidays?

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!
Did you actually just say that?

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
We'll be employed, but we'll
still get some time off?

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
Any decent employer
would do the same.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
Let me think.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
We can afford to close
the shop one day a week,

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
or we can try taking
holidays in shifts.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
That's so nice!

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
Am I dreaming right now?

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
Why would this be a dream?

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Manager.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
She's emotional because if
you're not from the town

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
you work in, the chances
of getting vacation days

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
are slim to none.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Are you serious?

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
All of our families were
so sad when we left

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
our hometown, just so we
could find some work.

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
They wanted us to stay,
but we had to make money, so.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
We could've been
hired by someone

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
who would overwork
yet underpay us.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
We might also be expected
to service them

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
in other ways.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
Ways I'd rather not say.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
But, you get it.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
[JANE] You'll give me nightmares
just talking about it, Fina!

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
It's awful, but true.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
Those types of employers
do exist in the world.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
So, workers have to be
mindful of those things

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
when they're applying for jobs.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So sexual harassment
and employee exploitation

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
happen in this world, too.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
Well, my shop's goal is
to run a clean business

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
in every sense of
the word and take care

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
of the employees.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
Everyone okay with that?

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes! Thank you, Manager!

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
Just popped in to
say dinner's ready.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
Selma's the best!

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
Yes! Perfect timing, too!

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
[SELMA] I'd love it if you could
stay and eat with us, Manager.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I guess I'm staying, then!

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
[SELMA] The oil's stuck
to the bottom of the pan.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
[JANE]
You're a lively one, aren't you?

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
Looks yummy!

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
[FINA]
"Yummy" as in you wanna eat it?

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
How's it going, Miss Maylene?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
Hi, Ryoma!

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
Doing guild work today?

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
Well, I had some free
time since my employees

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
can handle the shop!

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Owning a business is one thing,

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
but hiring people to run
it is quite a step up!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I really lucked out, huh?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
"Luck," you say?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
I think what got you
where you are is skill.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
Luck is part of it,
but far from all of it.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
Maybe my luck'll hold out
and I'll find a good job.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
Before you go...

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh?

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
It's not a job or anything.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
But it's something
I think you'll like.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
I know you,
which is why I also know

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
this adventuring party
called Pier of Sikum

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
has something that
would interest you.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
'Kay. I'm listening.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
They informed us that
they caught a rare breed

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
of slime not too long ago.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
Say what?!

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
I need all the details you have!

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
They went to the Tamer's Guild
to try and sell it, but no dice.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
Even though they
knew it was rare.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
Slimes are very
neglected creatures.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
Actually, that's good!

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
That means it's up
for sale, right?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
So, you want it?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Oh, you bet!

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
that party is right now?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.983 position:50% align:center
This is where she told me to go.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
But I think it's abandoned.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Hello.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
Are you guys the Pier
of Sikum, by chance?

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
[SHIN]
That's right. And you are?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
Oh, where are my manners?
My name is Ryoma.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
I'm a tamer 'n' adventurer.
Like you.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
What? But you're so young!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
Ah! You're not an adventurer.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
You're a scruffy little kid!

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
Sein, pipe down.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
Sorry. It's not you,
he's just in a bad mood.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yeah, I heard the story.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
You found a really rare slime,
but weren't able to sell it.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
[SHIN]
Yeah.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
And Sein's not taking it well.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
Did you come to
laugh in our face?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
[SEIN]
Laugh it up, then!

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
We're a party of idiots!

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
We know how lame slimes are,

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
but we heard they
can sell pretty well

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
if it's a rare breed.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
So we came all the way
to this stupid town,

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
but we have nothing
to show for it. Nothing.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Note to self:
always drink in moderation.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
[SIKUMA] If you're gonna
hurl, don't do it here.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
[retching]

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
[SIKUMA] Hey! The heck
did I just tell you?

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
Anyway.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
I'm the Pier of Sikum's leader.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
You can call me Shin.

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
And I'm Kai.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
So, why exactly
did you seek us out?

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Remember that rare
slime that nobody wanted?

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd like to
purchase it from you.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
You're joking, right?

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
I collect and study slimes

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
as a kind of hobby.

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
So if you actually
did come across

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
a super unique slime,

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
I would love to take
it off your hands.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
Huh. We do, in fact,
have a rare slime,

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
and we'd love to sell it.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
For how much?

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
Might be better if
you set the price.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
The Tamer's Guild told us
it was a worthless monster.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
Makes it hard to gauge.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Would you mind
if I see the slime before

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.864 position:50% align:center
I decide the cost, then?

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
I'll pay extra if it's
a type I don't own yet.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
Does that sound okay?

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Deal.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
Wait here.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
It's inside?

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
[KAI]
Be careful.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
Always am.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
What type of slime could it be?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Whoa.
What kind of fluid is that?

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Never seen anything like it.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
[SHIN]
So. Whaddya think?

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
It's brand new to me,
so I'll pay extra!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
Wow! Really?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
Finally!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Here. Will this be enough?

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
I mean yes, it is enough,
but maybe a little too much.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you,
I have a new breed of slime

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
to research.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
It makes me happy, and you
can't put a price on that.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
All right.
So long as you think it's fair.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
Pleasure doing business.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
You have my sincere thanks.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
We should be thanking you.
Big time!

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
Very true.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
At least we don't have
to worry about money now.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
That should calm
Sein down a bit.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Nothing quite ruins
a mood like money problems,

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
that's for sure.

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:25.980 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
Your party should
stay in this town!

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Or at least you should if quick
cash is what you're after.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
Every year there's an
outbreak of grell frogs

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
in a nearby lake, so it's
basically a treasure trove

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
for adventurers!

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
Never heard of a grell frog.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
Well.
Every part of them has a use,

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
so every part of them
fetches a price.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Check with the guild to
get more specific details.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
We will. Thanks!

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
We owe you!

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're definitely
indebted to you.

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
But, hey if you come
visit my shop one day,

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
we'll call it even!

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
[KAI]
What shop?

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Besides being an
adventurer and slime enthusiast,

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
I run a laundry service.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
What? Kid, you're unbelievable.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
It's a place in town
called Bamboo Forest.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
If you guys ever get goblin
grime on your clothes,

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
please come see me!

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
You got it, kid.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Till we meet again, then!

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Okay.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Time to make a taming contract.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
All right! Contract complete!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
Now, for the appraisal.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Bloody slime.

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
that is what it looks like.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
And it has a "vampirism" skill.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
Three guesses
as to what it eats.

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
It's drinking!

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
Did it go inside so
it could suck directly

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
from the blood vessels?

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
What an intriguing little slime.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
Guess it must've
gotten its fill.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
Y'know what you'd be good for?

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
Cleaning up defeated
monster corpses.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
Among other things, I'm sure.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Hello there, bloody slime.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
How pure is Ryoma
and the love he has

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
for his slimes?

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
I'd wager the feeling is mutual.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
He treats them so well,
how can they not?

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
That face.

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
It's so much brighter
than it was before.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
He looks every bit like
a normal kid, doesn't he?

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
Sending him there might
be one of the best

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
decisions we've ever made.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
I'm so proud.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
The older I get,
the more easily the tears

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
seem to flow.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
[KUFO, LULUTIA laugh]

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The grell frog outbreak
was fast approaching.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Mister Ryoma.

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
My father, grandfather,
and mother

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
are teaching me
taming magic tomorrow.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
You're more than welcome
to come and join us,

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
if you want to.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
That does sound fun.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:51.978 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
And educational since
I'll have three teachers.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
True!

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:58.401 position:50% align:center
I'd really love to see you
use taming magic, so yes!

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
Thanks. That means a lot.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
Shall we travel
together tomorrow?

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'm really looking
forward to seeing

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
what someone with
your potential can do

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
with taming magic.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.997 position:50% align:center
Hope I don't disappoint!

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.332 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]
