[RYOMA] Bamboo Forest Laundry
Service, or my laundry service,

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
was just about to open,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to throw a party
to celebrate the occasion!

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
I invited every single person
who helped me out.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
It was my way of giving
back and thanking them

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
for their kindness.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
We'd love to go!

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
That sounds lovely.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
I may be old,
but I can still party!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
Great! It should be fun!

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
Are we there yet?

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.931 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's just right
around the corner here.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
The building with the flowers.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Even goblin grime.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
Cleaned for cheap, huh?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM] What's with
the name "Bamboo Forest

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
Laundry Service," though?

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
I think this'll be perfect.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
How's it coming? You okay?

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Yes! Nearly ready to go!

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
All that's left is
to wait for it to bake!

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
Then we're right on
track with everything!

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have done
it without your help.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
Every party needs snacks,
so I'm very grateful.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Of course, we're more
than happy to help.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
If you ever need any assistance,
please don't hesitate to ask us!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
Especially if it's for
something fun like planning

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
a party! Okay?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.871 position:50% align:center
[door chimes]

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
You hear that?
Mister Serge's back!

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
A very impressive shop.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
And an 11-year-old built
this whole place

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
from the ground up, you say?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
Age is quite irrelevant
in this boy's case.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
Try not to judge by appearances.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
The world's much bigger
to those with open minds.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
And although he's been staying
with the ducal family, he--

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Mister Serge!

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
Glad you're here!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed by what you've
done with the place.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
Top notch, Ryoma.

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
Hard work pays off!

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
Hi there.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
You must be my new recruits!

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
Yes. They are, indeed!

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
I'd call them "assistants"
before "recruits," though.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
Greetings.
My name is Carla Norad.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
Hello. My name is Callum Norad.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
And I'm Eliaria Jamil.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
I helped out with
the preparations

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
for the party today.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Nice to know you're
here to help as well.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Of course.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
My brother and I
are at your service.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] Whatever you need,
we shall do our best to provide.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
They're young,
but they know their stuff!

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
They served as sub-manager
and deputy sub-manager

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
at the Luiam branch
of my own company.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[SERGE] If anyone is suited to
get your business on the

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
right track, it's these two!

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
Allow me to show you how
the workflow will operate here.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
Follow me, please.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
First thing.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
We request that every one
of our customers purchase

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
a sack to hold the laundry
we'll be cleaning.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
There are several sizes,
and they can use it

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
as many times as they want.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Right.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
How much they're charged
depends on what size

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
sack they use.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
The larger the sack,
the larger their laundry fee.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Right.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Now once you've accepted their
payment and taken their laundry,

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
the next thing you do is
give them a reception tag

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
like this one.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
They'll need it so they
can claim their order

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
once it's ready.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
As soon as you get a sack,
please put it in here.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
This is the room where the
cleaner slimes will operate.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
Oh. Have you two been
told what those are?

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
Actually, we have.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
They're slimes that eat grime.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
Precisely.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
Do either of you have
any questions so far?

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
We have a few regarding
this new breed of slime.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
Does it really clean
as well as they say?

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
And how should we dry the
laundry after it gets washed?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
That's how it's done.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
Just put the laundry
back in the sack,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
then return it to the customer.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] So these slimes
are capable of cleaning any

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
and all grime?

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
I haven't found a reason to
suggest otherwise as of now.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
But that said,

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
I would still like you to
double-check everything

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
before returning it, please.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM]
Understood.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
As for drying, the process
doesn't involve water,

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
so there isn't a need to.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Guess it's misleading
to call it laundry.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
Just some slimes having a meal.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
We understand now.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
So that's how everything works.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
You keeping up okay?

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
As well as we can, thanks.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
Well, any questions, please
don't hesitate to ask me.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
We'll do that.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I wonder if they don't
approve since it's not a typical

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
way of doing laundry.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
They both strike me
as very professional.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.780 position:50% align:center
Maybe they think this kind
of work is beneath them.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
Employees are the only
ones allowed back here.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
If you see a customer,
please direct them elsewhere.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50% align:center
This side, there's a dressing
room, should you need it.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
There's also a break
area and office.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
And a restroom, as well.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
You'll find the
kitchen over here.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
We understand.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.719 position:50% align:center
These are the dorms.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
You two are the
first to live here.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
So choose whichever
room you like.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Understood.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
Hey! [laughs]

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
I didn't know they'd
all be so punctual.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. So, um...

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
I'm throwing this party.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
Would either of you mind
giving me a hand with it?

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
We can do that.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
Here. For you. Drink up!

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
Thanks, my lady. I will!

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] This reminds me of those
office speeches I sometimes

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
had to do in the morning.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
Hardly anyone ever listened.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Um! Everyone?

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming!

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping Bamboo Forest
Laundry will be successful!

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
Your presence makes
me feel it will!

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
They just grow up so fast.

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop acting like
you're his mother.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
This wouldn't have been
possible without you,

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
and I mean everyone!

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
So thank you!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
I mean it more than
words can say.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
So... I tried saying it
with food instead.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
Please, feel free
to help yourselves.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
It's not much, but hopefully
you'll find it to your liking!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.147 position:50% align:center
To happiness! Cheers!

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
This is great! Well done!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
Congrats, Ryoma!

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Thank you, my lady!

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] If it's fish,
I'll take the whole plate!

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
Yummy!

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
This is good.
I'm goin' back for seconds!

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
How'd a dirty hag like
you get an invite, huh?

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
Who're you calling dirty?

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm a self-proclaimed hag,

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
but I'm the furthest
thing from dirty!

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
If anyone knows that word's
meaning it would be you!

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
There's no need to bring
up the past every time

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
you and I happen to meet, okay?

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
No, please go on!

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
Why does he know the
meaning of the word "dirty?"

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
Well, Maylene.

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
once, on a mission,
this whippersnapper--

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
Enough! Please, stop talking!
Maylene!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
Go get some food
while the line's down!

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
Fine. See ya later.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Good grief. Hey.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
What now? Can I talk?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN] What's your honest
opinion of Ryoma's business?

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
You think it'll thrive?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
There's not a doubt in my mind.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Yes. Although I don't know
exactly how well it will do.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
I'm confident he'll
stay in business.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN] Aren't you gonna give
him some tips or something?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA] He has a good
head on his shoulders,

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
so I'm perfectly content just
watching from the sidelines.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
For now, at least.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
However.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
If he came to me,
directly, seeking advice,

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be
opposed to giving it.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
You'd better keep close
watch over him, too,

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
you hear me?

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Yeah. Loud and clear.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
It appears he's earned the trust
of everyone in attendance.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
Yes. It does.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
That's really kind of you!

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
Such helpful creatures!

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
They really are!

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Yes! Nice and flakey!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Mmm! They look as
good as they smell!

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
So, Duke Reinhart.
Did you like all of the food?

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
Yes. Very much.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
I enjoyed every bite.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
That's hard to believe.
Your palate's more refined.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
What I served is nothing
like noble party food.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
Did I say something wrong?

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
Not wrong.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
Although I should
probably fill you in.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
Fill me in?

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
The rich may eat it.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
But sometimes they
have poor taste.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Whaddaya know?

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
I guess even nobles have their
fair share of problems.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
[MIYA sighs]
I am one fat cat! Fur real!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
Coming was a very good choice!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
I think I'm gonna need you
to roll me home, Miya.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Everyone! Look!

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
Dessert is finally ready!

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
There's dessert?!

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Always room for that!

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
I'm gonna get a meow-thful!

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
[JEFF]
Looks delicious!

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I'm glad they're
enjoying themselves.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
This is great!

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
It was over before I knew it,

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
but it was a success
nonetheless!

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Mister Callum? Miss Carla?

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
Thank you both for
all you've done today.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's opening day,
and it'd be great if you

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
could be here to
help me with it.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
But I understand if
you'd rather not.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Now that you mention it,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
we've discussed this.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
If staying here with you
is a good fit for us.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
And we both want to work here.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
You're positive?

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
We definitely had strong
concerns at first.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
A laundry service
done by slimes?

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
And run by an
11-year-old, no less.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
You made every worry
we had disappear.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
The shop. Your bright
and friendly demeanor.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
Also, the amazing amount
of trust that so many

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
have in you.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] We saw all
of those things clearly

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
and believe we could learn
quite a bit from you.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
If you would have us, that is.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best
not to let you down.

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
Day in and day out.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
We know the Takebayashi name
must be important to you.

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
So we will both
strive to honor it.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
Such a relief to have
people with your expertise

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
in business on board.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
Not just one, but two!

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
It's great!

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
Same.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
Uh... "Honoring my family name"
might be a bit much, though.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
But I'm not like Mister Serge.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
I don't have a
reputation at all.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
It's the least we can do, Sir.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Even if it were small,
a distasteful rumor

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
among nobles
spreads like wildfire.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
But why would the nobles
be gossiping about my shop?

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] Well, most of them
make it their business to know

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50% align:center
about other nobility's business.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
Other? Wait.
There's some kinda mix-up.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
You don't think I'm
a noble, do you?

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you aren't?

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
We've been misinformed, then.

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
We thought you were
connected to the Jamils.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
Their daughter seemed
friendly enough with you.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
Oh, well...

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
It's true that I'm
friends with them,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
but I'm actually
not a noble myself.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
That's my fault.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
I should've explained,
but time got away from me.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
So he's not? Huh.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I'm just an adventurer,
so please act normal.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
Okay? I'm not a
big deal. Honest!

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we have a
big day ahead of us,

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
so make sure you get
plenty of rest tonight.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Right!

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] Drinking that
will change your color?

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] Rub-a-dub-dub
till you're all squeaky clean.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
Rub-a-dub-dub.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It's finally opening
day for Bamboo Forest.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
I wonder if we'll
get any customers.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Best not to get
my hopes too high.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.123 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Good morning.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
Manager and my lady.

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
Heh. Thanks, same to you.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
Yes, good morning.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
All right.
Let's have a great first day!

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
Looks good.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
You're officially open!

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I'm heading out
for a minute, you two.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
I sincerely doubt we'll
get customers right away,

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
but I trust you'll
be ready when we do.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
I'll see if I can drum up
business by telling

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
the Adventurer's Guild
we're open now.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
I hope you both have
a wonderful first day!

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Thank you. Please take care!

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You don't have to walk with me.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] But the inn's not
that far out of the way.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] I've got it
covered, though. See?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES yawns]

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
I gotcha.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
So today's a
training day for you.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
Hope it goes well.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.177 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I hope your day goes well, too!

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
Mister Ryoma!

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
Bye!

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
[M ADVENTURER A]
Hey!

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
Today's your shop's
grand opening, right?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
I'll visit as soon
as my job's done.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
That's really nice of you.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
But how did you know I was open?

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
You mean you didn't see it?

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ryoma's laundry service?

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
Open now? Whoa.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
Earlier, Miya and
Welanna came by

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
and put that sign up.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I had no idea.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
[M ADVENTURER B] They said they
were gonna advertise at other

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
places, too.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
[M ADVENTURER A]
But yeah!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
I'll see you as soon
as I knock off work!

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
Awesome!
See you in a few hours, then!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
Oh! Our full-body wash
includes clothes,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
weapons, and armor!

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
Bring everything!

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
No matter how dirty it may be!

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
[M ADVENTURER A]
You got it!

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Cool. I'll work, too!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
A gathering-herbs request?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
I can do that and patrol
the mines at the same time.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
Done.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
Heya! Here!

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
I wanna take this job on today.

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
Always such a go-getter!

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
But is this really
time for a job?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be elbows-deep
in laundry by now.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
I'm not expecting much
business on the first day.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. All set. Off you go.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
Everything seems
to be in order here.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
That should be
enough patrolling.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
You guys did great.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the others are
having luck gathering herbs.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
I checked on the mines just like
Duke Reinhart requested.

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
Then I delivered the
herbs my slimes found

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
and collected my pay.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
That's when I
returned to my shop.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
What the--?
Maylene was right.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have
taken on that job!

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
They need me! I have to help!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You're here!

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
Are you guys okay? Or uh...?

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
Of course! We're more than okay!

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
Good news travels fast.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
So the whole neighborhood
heard of this shop.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What? Really?

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting
for you to open.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
I caught wind of this place
from a few adventurers.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
The sign says you
clean goblin grime,

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
and I believe you
shouldn't knock something

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
till you've tried
it at least once!

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
And the prices are great!

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Such a steal!

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Aw. I'm glad you think so.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
All right! Go time!

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
You two handle the front!

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
Keep doing what you're doing!

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of
the back of house!

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Good thing
I don't have time to cry,

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
otherwise I'd be a wreck.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
There was only time to work!

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
And we worked nonstop
for the entire shift.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA sighs]

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
You both did amazing!

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
That goes for you guys, too!

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] It was a very
impressive turnout, I must say.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
It was!

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
Who knew so many
people had clothes

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
that needed cleaning?

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
No chance to breathe.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
Did either of you
get any break today?

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Sorry 'bout that!

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] How could I exploit
my workforce so carelessly?

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
Did I learn nothing
from my past life?

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
I'll hire new workers
as soon as possible.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
How many should
I hire is the question.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Four? Actually, six sounds good.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
Great idea.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
Because it's going to get
even busier than it was today!

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
And word has only
just begun to spread.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
Contact the Merchant's
Guild about this.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Trust me, okay?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
They can introduce you to
a ton of potential employees.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
Oh, perfect!

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
I'll make my way
over there right now

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
and get everything
taken care of!

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir!

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
You should get some
rest once you're done

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
calculating our sales.

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
Phenomenal work, you two!

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
We're off to a great start!

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA]
So. How was your first day?

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
It was a lot crazier
than I thought it'd be,

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
but somehow we managed.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA laughs]

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.021 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling business
would be booming.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
What I didn't know
was just how explosive

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
it would wind up being.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
So. Let me guess
why you're here.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
Is it to find more employees?

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
You really are quick
on the uptake, huh?

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I've been an
old hag for a while,

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I've learned some things.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
How long is "a while?"

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Right, then.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
I'll gather you some
grade-A candidates.

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
Who you actually employ
will be your decision to make.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
Thanks!
Just what I wanna hear!

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Wow!

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
You had that many
customers on day one?

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Fantastic news!

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
True. But it's still too
early to call it a success.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
Now that my shop's held
in high regard, it'll hit harder

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
if it falls.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
But I plan on giving
it all that I've got.

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
Hopefully it'll be enough.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
I think you'll be fine, Ryoma.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Just wait and see!

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
You should pay a visit to the
town guard's quarters soon.

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Why?

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
Because it's jam-packed
with working men.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
Which means laundry galore,
I would imagine.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
Who knows? Might be a stable
source of income for you.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
Worth a try.
Thanks for the suggestion.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're ready for bed.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
We'll talk later.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
Saying it was a long day
feels like the understatement

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
of the year.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA yawns]

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.801 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Mister Ryoma.

00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
Have a good night!

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
You, too, my lady.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Man, I'm beat.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
But...

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
Just us yet again!

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
Shut up and do your work.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I might as well
have been dead before I died

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
from how little
I slept back then.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
Now, even though
I'm exhausted...

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.627 position:50% align:center
...I feel so at peace.
