00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.472 position:50% align:center
I think this place will do.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
Well, then. Shall we begin?

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
Sure, ready when you are!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
First, what's the nature
of taming magic?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
Do either of you know?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
--Ooh!
--Elia?

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
The nature of taming magic
is to enter a contract

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
with a monster in order
to gain its help!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
The tamer and monster are
then able to communicate

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
with each other thanks
to the link that's forged

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
between them as a result
of the contract.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Precisely.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
And based on that very
link you just described,

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
the two of you are
going to be learning

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
"Shared Sensation" magic today.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of that kind.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
It lets you gain
information through

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
your familiar without
actually speaking.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
It also does things
like let your monsters

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.100 position:50% align:center
know if you're in trouble.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
It's specific to taming magic.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
So you'll never see a
summoner use this technique.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why's it not possible
with summoning magic?

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
The bond isn't exactly the same.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
Summoning magic forces
the monster to obey

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
its master's commands.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
It's a one-way link since
it doesn't have a choice.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ah, I gotcha.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
You'll need a great
deal of experience

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.914 position:50% align:center
if you're going to
fully utilize this skill.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
The closer you are
with your familiars,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
the more effective it will be.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
The deeper your shared
understanding, the better.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.882 position:50% align:center
But today, rather than
train with the monsters

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.175 position:50% align:center
you've tamed,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
you'll be working with
these crew birds instead.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
We should use our slimes,
shouldn't we?

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
It's hard to tell how
effective the magic is

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
--with slimes.
--Mm-hmm.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.019 position:50% align:center
Sad, but true.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
They don't have the
senses that we do.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.315 position:50% align:center
No sight, or smell, or hearing.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
And though they eat,
they don't taste.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.362 position:50% align:center
I understand, too.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] Good! Let's get these
contracts with the crew birds

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.699 position:50% align:center
underway, then!

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.783 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA, RYOMA]
Right!

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Contract complete.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Yes. Same for me.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.884 position:50% align:center
Then it's time for you to try
sharing your sensations.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Now, there's not a verbal
spell involved in this.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.431 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is focus on your link

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
with the familiar.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
That's really it?

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.309 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
Imagine what it's like
to be behind its eyes.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.363 position:50% align:center
Create a mental image.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.242 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Like a video camera.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
Or maybe a virtual
reality simulator.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
Wow. It's working!

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
But...

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
This is making me nauseous.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
You succeeded?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.761 position:50% align:center
Of course he did.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
Right now,
I can see myself.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
Which makes me fairly
certain I'm doing it.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
It's supposed to be
a hard magic to learn,

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
yet he's treating
it like child's play!

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] Don't worry,
the nausea you're feeling

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
is natural.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
It may not be pleasant,
but it is part of the process.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Give closing your eyes a try.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
Concentrate on just
the familiar's vision.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That was a good call.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
I feel much better.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] This is a rather
peculiar experience.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The only reason I
was able to do it so quickly

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
is that I had knowledge
of similar Earth technology

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
to help me out.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
The Lady didn't have
any such advantage,

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
but still picked
it up right away.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
That's impressive.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
[ARAUNE]
Mister Ryoma. Here you are.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I appreciate it!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
It's truly remarkable
how fast both of you

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
picked up that technique.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
I thought this one might
slip him up a little bit,

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
but no!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
Though being a quick study
is good thing, dear.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to train.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt I'll get
used to that weird feeling

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
any time soon.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
But I'll still try!

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The first time
I tried virtual reality,

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
I got sick, too.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
But If anyone can
overcome it, she can.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
By the way...

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
This is your very first time
contracting a monster

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
that isn't a slime, is it not?

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Uh... Yes. That's right.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Does anything feel off?

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Not in particular. No.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
We know how good you
are with your slimes,

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
but it seems you have an
aptitude for bird-types, too.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Aptitude?

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
Something every
taming magician has.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
It's easier to tame some
monsters than others.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
Just depends on
the one doing it.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Hmm.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
So then, taming slimes
is easy for me

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
because I was meant to!

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
I don't think there's
any doubt about that.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] Not only are
you compatible with them,

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
but you've also managed to
tame more than a fair share.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
Discovering which familiar
is the perfect match

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
for you is one of the
key skills for becoming

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
a good tamer.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
And the only way
you can do that is

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
through experience.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
If you don't mind me asking,

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
what kind of aptitude do
you have, Sir Reinbach?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
If it's something with scales,

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
then chances are
we'll match quite well.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
Though I can't handle
the amount of monsters

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
you can at one time,
the ones I do tame

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
are very powerful.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Oh, wow.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
I, on the other hand...

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
I've always had a knack
for taming things

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
with four legs.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
I couldn't enter a
contract with a bird-type

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
to save my life, though.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
As for me...

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
[ELISE laughs]

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
I honestly had no
intention of startling you.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
This is Lwarg.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
If you've heard of little
fenrirs, that's what this is.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50% align:center
Fenrir?
Like the legendary one?

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
That's the Fenrir.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
You mean they're not the same?

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
The one you're thinking
of is divine.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
But little fenrirs are
wolf-like monsters

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
with the ability to use
some ice magic.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
While they may not be divine,
they're certainly not pushovers.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
That's really something.
That they can use magic.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
And what's more is the madam
completely domesticated it.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] This one might look
slightly more majestic

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
than average because it's
the alpha of the pack.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
I have 20 others, you see.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Twenty?!

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
In addition to
my little fenrirs,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
I've also managed to
tame about 100 more

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
various wolf-type familiars.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
Wolf-type monsters
are my specialty,

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
as I'm sure you've guessed.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] My slimes win in
quantity, but she's definitely

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
got me beat in quality.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
Elise is one of the most gifted
tamers in all of Seilfall.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
However, with that said,
it's not because

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
little fenrirs are
difficult to tame.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Could've fooled me!

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
Back in the day,
just watching her pure skill,

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
I wound up developing
a bit of a complex.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
Whatever complex do you mean?

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
"Well, I have a sword!"

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
is what you said when
you chose to focus

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
on your swordsmanship.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Still, you could've stuck
with taming magic

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
if you wanted since
you weren't exactly

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
lacking in it.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
Not in comparison
to Father and you.

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
Being a "just okay"
tamer is pretty much

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
the equivalent of being useless.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH laughs]

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
I don't seem to remember
you ever being

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
that bothered by it, though!

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.225 position:50% align:center
In fact, the thing I recall
is you setting aside

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
your taming magic training to go
and practice with the sword.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
That's not either of
our faults, now is it?

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
[REINHART chuckles]

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] This is such
a crazy development!

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
So the madam
has 20 little fenrirs

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
and 100 more wolf-type
monsters on top of that!

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
Then there's Sir Reinbach,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
who's just as impressive
in his own right!

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Looks like something heavy's
weighing on your mind.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
It's just dawning on me
that when I'm surrounded

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
by you and your family,
I'm surrounded

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
by incredible people.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
--[ELISE] Ryoma.
--Yes?

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
What you just said,
about us being incredible?

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
What if I told you
that Lord Reinbach

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
is even more incredible
than you think?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
He has fewer than 20 monsters.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
But the number isn't
important when you look

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
at the quality.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
Since half of them are
dragon-type monsters.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
It's like he hacked the
system with cheat codes

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
or something!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH laughs]

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
Sometimes people just
get lucky like that.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
Not only did I have
the right aptitude.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
The first monster
I ever contracted was

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
an extremely powerful beast!

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
It had other dragons
under its command,

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.215 position:50% align:center
so when it joined me,
they joined, too.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
I don't call on them
unless it's important.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
How much chaos could
I cause with no restraint?

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] A lot.
And that's an understatement.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
So, if you rarely use them,
then where are they normally?

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
We own land in the mountains,
and they all live there.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
Though, they're not the
only threatening things

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
in those cliffs.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
That's why my dragons
stay there and prevent

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
those other monsters
from coming down

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
and running amok
throughout our land.

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] While my familiars
live on a different mountain.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
One that's home to
precious medicinal herbs.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
If poachers find
their way up there,

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
the wolves run them off.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I see.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
A tamer with strong creatures
at their command

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
is nice and everything,

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
but they have to take
into consideration

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
where those creatures will live.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Okay. Break time is over.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
So. Are you two ready to
practice shared sensation again?

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Pochi. Miké. Tama. Kuro.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
Don't come any closer.
You might hurt yourself!

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] A few days after
our training, the lady and I

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
continued to practice
our taming magic

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
in the mines.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center
I made waterproof fabric
while I was at it.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Did you just say
the grell frog outbreak?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
Yes! It'll be starting soon!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. It's time.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
[LEIPIN] The peak will probably
be in three or four days.

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center
Can't wait to get my
paws on some cash!

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
No joke considering the
medicine that they make!

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
It's also an ideal
time for training.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
So, yeah! Ryoma!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
We actually came here
because we had a question.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
A question for me?

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.232 position:50% align:center
What do you wanna know?

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
[WELANNA] Remember that work
outfit you wore that one time?

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.905 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us where
exactly you got it from?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
Please?

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
We love your shop,
but we wanna get clothes

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
that don't soil
so easily for this.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's a great question!

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
And the answer is at the
Morgan Trading Company.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
Just ask for Mister Serge.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
And don't forget to tell
him that I sent you all!

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
That way he'll know
to take care of you guys!

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
I know that place!
There's one in Gimul!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yep!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
And there's lots of gear
like mine for sale!

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center
Then we shall take
our leave of you

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
and make our way over to
this Morgan Trading Company.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Always a pleasure.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] So. I take it
that you heard the news?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yes.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
Since limour birds fly in
to hunt the grell frogs,

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
there'll be an outbreak
of them, too!

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
And I'm going to
tame at least one!

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
We should go ahead
and let you know.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
We've decided that
we're going to visit

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
the lake the day after tomorrow.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? I understand.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
[guitar playing]

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] So if the limour
birds like the music I play,

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
it'll make it easier
for them to accept

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
a taming contract with me.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[guitar continues]

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
I've lost my touch.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
That happens when you
don't practice, though.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll keep at it
till it's good enough

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
for the contract.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
Or, at least I hope
it's good enough.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
It's soon.
The day after tomorrow.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
In other words...

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
It's nearly time for me
to say good-bye

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
to the lady and the others.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
In the blink of an eye,
the day after tomorrow arrived.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
So. Tired.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
Um, how're you feeling, Ryoma?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
I'm even better than usual!

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
Gosh, I really wish I had
your kind of stamina.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
You're fine, my lady.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Ryoma's an outlier,
so I assure you

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
your stamina is
nothing to scoff at

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
for a child your age.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
You can say that again!

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
Emphasis on the "outlier" part.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I feel like
he's not of this world!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
Most 11-year-olds would be ready
for a snack and naptime by now.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Those guys!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid!

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
Mister Shin!

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
You know them?

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
Guess you could say
we're guild buddies

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
since they're a party
of adventurers.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
Go on ahead.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
I'll catch up with
everybody later.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Thank you. For your help.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
You're like a hero to us.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Don't be silly!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
I should be thanking
you for that rare slime

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
you sold me!

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
So you're the one
who bought the slime?

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's me.

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
I see. My name's Sein.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
Please forgive my crude,
drunken behavior!

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
Not only did you
overpay for that slime,

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
you told us all about
the grell frog outbreak!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
That little tip is gonna
keep us fed for months

We're gonna sell these

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
then head over to this
awesome little place

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
called Bamboo Forest

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
It's cheap, fast, and
the results are better

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
than anything I've ever
hand-washed myself!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center

for your patronage!

could be so cool?

suck like never before

Ryoma. Elia.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Just down the way,
there's a person attempting

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
to tame a limour bird.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
How much does musicality factor
into this process, exactly?

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
I heard there was a man who was
very confident in his ability.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
But he wasn't able to
attract a single bird.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
At least until, he smashed
his instrument.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
That was the one
noise they liked.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Great for him.
Bad for his instrument.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Yes, and when they don't
like a performance,

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
they make a rather
uncomfortable, cautionary sound.

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
I wonder what it sounds like.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center

It's more like they're,
straight-up mocking him.

Some people assume
mild-mannered creatures

are weak, but that's
not the case with these.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
If you underestimate them
and try to subdue them

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center

to regret it instantly.

currently regretting it

Sure. But...

I don't understand
what they were doing.

What?

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
So then, those sound

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I guess not.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
That was no ordinary limour
bird Ryoma just stopped.

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
It was an advanced
species known as

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
the nightmare limour bird.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Nightmare, huh?

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
Based on the sound it made,
I'd say that's a fitting name.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
Once every ten years,

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
that rare and terrifying
creature flies down

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
and makes itself known.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
And while all limour
birds have wind magic,

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
their nightmare counterparts
wield dark magic as well.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
It can also attack the mind.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
And thanks to
the dark magic song

that pierced our eardrums,

we got to experience that
prominent feature firsthand.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
It has the power to create
fear inside the heart.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
It causes confusion.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
It's even been known to
knock a person out cold.

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Now that I'm looking,
it caused quite a scene.

[SEBAS] Even the most
seasoned adventurer

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
isn't immune to losing
consciousness.

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
And those ones over
there are just about

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
as green as it gets.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
So I'm not surprised
it turned out like this.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
You can train to counter it.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
But it'll still feel
awful no matter what.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Oh, yeah.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
I do have a skill called
mental pain resistance.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
That's probably why
I wasn't affected by it.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
But I still need to be careful
about that

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
because I didn't even
realize I was under attack.

--[ELIARIA] Mister Ryoma?
--Yes?

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Oh. I think I have
some kind of resistance

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
to mental pain.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
So how much damage
was done in total?

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
Just one injury.

in the first place got hurt.

I see.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
So whadda we do?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
Not a bird in sight.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
That damn ruckus
scared them all away.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
We could try and
find their nest.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
We could.
But it's not exactly easy.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
And, well, those birds
fly much farther

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
than other monsters do.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center

think about the ground

That's too bad.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center

who wanna tame

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center

to stake 'em out?

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center

they'll even be back today.

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center
Whacha think?
You wanna wait?

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
