Miss Selma.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center
Our stomachs are growling.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
Good timing.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center

So, what's on the menu today?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
[SELMA]
I'm glad you asked!

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
Awesome job!

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
But, I guess that's nothing
new for you guys.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
Hey. You better not be
slacking off in here.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
And what makes you
think I would be?

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
Another busy day in the books.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and
lock the front door.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.080 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm on it.

[RYOMA]
They're not coming back.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
No.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
Umm, Mister Ryoma?

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yes?

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] We'll be going our
separate ways soon.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Uh...
What in this world and the next

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
am I supposed to say to that?

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:24.417 position:50% align:center
This kind of thing is completely
out of my wheelhouse.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.295 position:50% align:center
Um... Uh...

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.715 position:50% align:center
I read a novel once that had
a similar situation play out.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center
But I forget what the
main character said.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
Uh... C'mon. Think!

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
He said, "It's not like
we're never going to

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
see each other again!"

[RYOMA]
You know, it's not like, uh...

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.396 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] It's not like you're
never going to see

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
each other again, Elia.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
She beat me to the punch!

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
Well? Isn't that right?

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's like you read my mind!

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess so.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.242 position:50% align:center
We will see each other again!

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
And besides.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
Until we reunite,
we can write to one another.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
I'll write to you as
much as I can!

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
And I promise that
I'll do the same!

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.712 position:50% align:center
You idiot!

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.338 position:50% align:center
Man up and go for a hug
when a girl gives you

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
a window like this!

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.882 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
something a member

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.467 position:50% align:center
of the lady's guard
should be saying!

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to stop
guys from doing that stuff!

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.014 position:50% align:center
Not whisper in their ears
and give them ideas!

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
But this is for my own
personal amusement.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
There's no need to pressure
him into doing something

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.396 position:50% align:center
he doesn't want to do.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
Although he's wise
beyond his years,

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
he's still just a boy.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I've never seen
the duke look like he wants

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
to tear someone's
head off before!

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
Ryoma.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
See? Muah, muah! Just like this!

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
Plus, if you don't
make a move now, 

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
somebody else
might beat you to it.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
You were totally
asking for that one.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
The tree has more
sense than him.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what else is new?

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
Nobody else found
that funny but you.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
And think of how
the lady must feel!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Wait!
How are you feeling, exactly?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Aw, man.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
The limour birds came back!

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
So did the nightmare one.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
Does it have its eye on me?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
I think I should step away.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
Just until the lady
plays her song.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
I doubt the nightmare bird
likes me very much.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
I am the reason they
left to begin with.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
They're probably cautious of me.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
If I stayed and watched,
I might wind up interfer--

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I don't care!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
There is a chance that my
attempt could end in failure,

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
but I refuse to blame
that on you!

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
So I would appreciate
it if you'd stay right

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
where you are and watch
me tame these birds.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
Because I want you here.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
You give me courage.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
All right then. I'll stay.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center

decide to fly away!

Oh! Yes, I nearly forgot!

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
I tamed them all!

That's my girl!

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
It was done beautifully!

I'm so proud, Elia!

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
I call that a score!

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center

get nine birds at once!

That's amazing!

You did it, my lady!

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
Always knew you could!

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center

and colorful new familiars!

Let's see what I can do!

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] I didn't realize you
were going to try as well!

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
I'm nowhere near as
talented a musician

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
as you are.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
But maybe your
luck will rub off!

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
Huh.
It looks similar to a violin,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
but I don't believe I've
ever seen that instrument.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
Just relax, Ryoma!

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
I wonder what his
music will sound like.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to hear!

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
Go on! I know you've got this!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center

I've never heard
this tune before.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
The scale he's
playing's quite rare.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center

it's very comforting.

liked me very much.

Hey there.

You did it, Mister Ryoma.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
I knew you could!

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
You're the cat's meow!

Wow, that song you
played for them

was so soothing!

Taming those limour
birds like that

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
was very cool!

Marvelously done, Mister Ryoma!

Simply taming one limour bird

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
can be a difficult
challenge to overcome.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
Yet both you and Elia
managed to tame

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
so many at one time!

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center

to say the very least!

advanced species too!

Huh?

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
But its feathers look different
than my nightmares.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] Oh, that's because
it's not a nightmare.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
It's something called
a "phantom limour bird."

magic like the nightmare,

It can cast light magic?

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
How extraordinary!

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
But wait. It gets better!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
Because the phantom's
even more rare

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
than the nightmare,

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
seeing both of these
creatures at the same place

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
at the same time is truly
a wonder we shouldn't

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
take for granted.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Duke Reinhart did
mention he isn't compatible

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
with bird-types.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
I thought he was exaggerating,
but I guess not.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I love traveling by slime,

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
but I stick out like
a sore thumb.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA laughs]
Please take me to Mister Ryoma!

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That night,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
the Jamils held a huge banquet.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
The main reason was to
celebrate the lady's success

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
in taming her birds.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
But it also served as
a farewell party for me.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yeah.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
It's almost time for us
to part ways.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Almost.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
Wow, the party's
still goin' strong.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
I wonder if they intend
to keep this up all night.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
I really hope no one has
a hangover tomorrow.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Since you're leaving
first thing tomorrow,

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
that would make it tougher.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Mister Ryoma.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
Are you going to be
living near the mines

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
from now on?

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
Uh... I am.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna patrol
them frequently,

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
it makes sense to
just move there.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
It's also a good place
to practice my magic

00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
without bothering anyone.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
It'll only be me and the slimes,
but I'll add rooms over time.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Ah, I see.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
So what about you?

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna be living
at the school dormitories

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
pretty soon?

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] Children of nobles are
supposed to attend school

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
in the capital from age 12.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
It's what's expected.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Not that there's
a law or anything.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
But if you don't have a special
reason for skipping out,

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
it just looks really bad.

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I see.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
The thing is...

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What is it?

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Going doesn't bother me so much,

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
but knowing I won't have
any friends does.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
You see, if my family's status
doesn't scare them off,

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
my magical power
is usually the cause.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Guess I've never
considered that.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
Status aside, you do
have a lot more magic

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
than the average person.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
Even though that's the case,

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
I don't see why people
wouldn't be your friend

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
because of those things.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
You don't know.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
A while back, I made a mistake.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
When I was five years old,

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
an older boy visited
my house and offered

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
to teach me magic.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
And then I made the
mistake of accepting.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
Of course,

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
I wasn't very good at
controlling my magic.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
One thing led to another,
and I accidently froze him.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Oh, but someone thawed
him out immediately

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
after it happened!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
He wound up being
okay and his family

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
didn't hold a grudge
against us or anything.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
What did happen?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
The catch was, he said
I did it on purpose.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
That anyone who crosses
me better watch out.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
He said I abuse my magic.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
I like seeing people squirm.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
For fun.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
Those rumors turned
into even bigger rumors

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
among the noble families.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
And people believed
them to the point

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
that they were
actually afraid of me.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I'm so sorry. That's terrible.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] I know I made
a mistake that day,

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
and I've decided to own it.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
Because honestly there's
no use in denying

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
it happened. So--

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
Now that you're aware, um...

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
Does it bother you at all?

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
After hearing that story,
are you afraid of me

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
like everyone else?

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Nah. Doesn't bother me one bit.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
Are you positive?

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
Even though I lost control
and hurt someone,

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
you don't see me
any differently now

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
that you know that fact?

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I mean, I wouldn't
go so far as to say

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
you hold no blame in the matter.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
But it's not unforgivable.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
It's bound to happen
once or twice to anyone

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
who's still learning
their craft.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
It's how we grow.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
How we grow?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] That probably came out
weirder than I meant it to!

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
What I mean is I'm
not scared of you.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
Not your status or
your powers, my lady.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
So, uh, are you scared?

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
I'm powerful, too.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I'm surprised you had to ask!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
Fear's the last thing
I feel when I'm with you.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
No matter what,
you won't scare me.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA chuckles]

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot that
I have something

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
I want to give you
before we part.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What is it?

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
Open it and see!

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
A ruby?

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] It's the necklace my
mother gave me on my

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50% align:center
tenth birthday.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
Pretty, isn't it?

00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
It's magic.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
How very perceptive of you!

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
Of course you would notice!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
The power you're
sensing is the ruby's.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
A magic stone?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
I feel like something
this powerful and rare

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
should be expensive.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
It is expensive!

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
Then there's no way
I can accept this.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
It's too precious!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Don't be like that.
I really want you to take it.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
This was a gift that
your mother gave you!

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.401 position:50% align:center
I'm not giving it to you
to keep forever.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
I just want you
to hold on to it.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Hm? Like a loan?

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
More like a good luck charm!

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
Before parting with a friend,
give them a special keepsake.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
This will increase your chance
of seeing them again.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Pick a keepsake as
special as the friend.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
I'm not making this up.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
it's from a really old saying!

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I feel like the
keepsake you picked for me

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
is too special.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] If I wasn't,
I wouldn't have given it to you.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Fair enough.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll take
excellent care of it.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Hang on a second.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
I should probably let her
have a keepsake

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
of mine in return.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
But what special
something could I give?

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
Money? Furs? No.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I want you
to take these with you.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
My slimes are precious to me.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
And I also think they'll
come in pretty handy.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
So, please, take them!

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Why is she laughing?!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I tried.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
But I'm not very good
with this kind of stuff.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
It was just very
in character for you.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
Thank you for trusting me
with your dear familiars.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
I promise to take
excellent care of them!

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling you
would say that.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Although it was
bittersweet, my final night

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
with the lady and her
family flew by as fast

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
as all of my days with them.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
And then morning came.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
Ryoma.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
Whenever you're not training
or washing clothes

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
or whatever else
you do, come visit!

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
You can get there
super quick with magic!

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely keep it in mind!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
You're all right, kid.
Good luck.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
See ya later, Ryoma. Take care.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
I won't cry because
we're parting ways.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
I'll smile because I met you!

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
No matter what you choose to do,
I hope you're successful in it.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, everyone.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Mister Hughes.
And Zeph. And Jill.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
Miss Araune. and Miss Lillian.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
You take care, too!

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Right. Now go say
goodbye to the others.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
Or, at least I would
tell you that.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
But it's you,
so I know you'll be fine.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Thanks for
lookin' out, Mister Camil.

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
Remember not to
work yourself too hard.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Should you need something,
and I mean anything,

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
don't hesitate
to let us know.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
Give yourself time to rest.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
And don't forget your promise.
Please.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Write to us and keep us updated!

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
Take it easy out there, Ryoma.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
And remember.
We're only a Warp away.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
Thanks, everybody. I mean it.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
It's been wonderful. Really.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
You've been so good
to me from day one!

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
Especially you, my lady.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Um... One more thing.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, of course, my lady.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
What's the thing?

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
What you just did.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
Actually, I've wondered about
this for quite some time.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
Feel free to correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
but it's my understanding
that you and I are friends?

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
From this day forward, please.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
I want you to stop
calling me "my lady."

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
You know me better
than that, so call me Elia.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
It's the name my family
and those closest to me use.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I noticed that.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
I'll use it, too. Eh--Elia.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Much better!

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
This is it. I'll be going
to school soon.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
But no matter what
happens while I'm there...

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stay positive!

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
I'll work hard and show
you all that I've learned

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
the next time we meet.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
Good! And I'll try to
do the same thing.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
Don't forget.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
We promised that we'd
reunite in three years

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
when I'm on vacation.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right!
In three years.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
And you can't get
out of it by saying

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
you're preoccupied with work!

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, when I show
you my new magic skills,

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
it'll be a firsthand experience.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I would like to try
and avoid that if possible.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
Although it's not my idea,

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
I heard that my mother
did that to my father.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it's very
effective for reminding men

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
of their promises.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I'll take your word on that.

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
I guess the silver lining
is Duke Reinhart survived.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
A "goodbye" doesn't
feel right to me.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
So I'll say
"see you again" instead!

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yeah. See you again, Elia.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
See ya!

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
One day, I'll see you again.

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
What am I doing standing
around when there's work

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
to be done?

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
We'll meet again. For sure.

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:36.272 position:50% align:center
Never would've guessed
how much they'd

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.899 position:50% align:center
really miss each other.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.317 position:50% align:center
That's so sad.

00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:40.944 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Kufo?

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:43.196 position:50% align:center
Of course they're going
to miss each other.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.532 position:50% align:center
Ryoma was practically
family to them!

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
Sometimes the people
who come into your life leave.

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:50.787 position:50% align:center
The good news is that
you can meet more people.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.373 position:50% align:center
So, Ryoma will be just fine.

00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:55.709 position:50% align:center
He's faced many
challenges in Seilfall,

00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:58.670 position:50% align:center
but making friends
isn't one of them.

00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:00.505 position:50% align:center
Can't argue that!

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:03.967 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] May Ryoma's future
be full of good fortune!

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.552 position:50% align:center
[LULUTIA, KUFO]
To good fortune!

00:23:05.635 --> 00:23:08.596 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] I pray you continue
to live life to the fullest.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.724 position:50% align:center
You'll have the eyes
of three gods watching

00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:14.144 position:50% align:center
over you as you do!

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:16.021 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] First, I'll stop
by Bamboo Forest

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:18.732 position:50% align:center
and see how they're doing,
then it's off to the mines.

00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:22.068 position:50% align:center
I'm homeless till I
build myself a home!

00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:25.030 position:50% align:center
I told Elia I'd work
just as hard as her.

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:27.824 position:50% align:center
That's another promise
I have to make good on!

00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.036 position:50% align:center
I'll push myself to my limits

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.705 position:50% align:center
and be better than the
person I was yesterday!
