[RYOMA]
With the help of my slimes,

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50% align:center
I finally opened
Bamboo Forest Laundry.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
The turnout for the
first day was better

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
than I could've hoped.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
As was the second!

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
I'm so thankful for
every single customer

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
and all the laundry
they needed cleaning.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMERS chattering]

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A] It's downright
miraculous what these slimes

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
can do!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
Here. All done.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.129 position:50% align:center
Please return them if they're
not cleaned to your liking.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
We'll make sure they are.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER B]
Looks good to me!

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's much
better than good!

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
No way!
That stain I gave up on is gone!

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
And the fabric is
so much softer now!

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot!
I'm definitely coming back!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
Great. We aim to please!

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Another satisfied
customer. Awesome!

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna step out for a sec.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
Need to pay the
Merchant's Guild a visit.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
[CARLA, CALLUM]
Okay. Have a safe trip.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA] I gathered some
candidates for you

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
who are real whizzes at math.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
And the best part is
any of them can start

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
as early as today.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you doing this,
even though it was short notice.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
The wolf knows the
ill beast's thoughts.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
In other words, I've got this.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
Expert tasks should be
taken care of by experts.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
If you want adventure, then go
to the Adventurer's Guild.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
If you want business advice,
then go the Merchant's Guild.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
Clean clothes? Go to you.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE A]
What's with the kid?

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE B] Is he the guild
master's grandson or something?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES chattering]

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to meet you all.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
My name's Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
I own the new laundry
service in town.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
And I'm looking
to hire more staff.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES chattering]

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
[FEI]
Hmm.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
I'd like to start by
thanking everyone

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
for taking time out of their
schedules to be here.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES chattering]

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I guess that's
a natural reaction.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for people with
good customer service

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
skills who can
also carry things.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
The items you'd
be expected to carry

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
are just sacks of clothing,
so the heavy lifting

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
isn't too heavy.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
Just something to consider!

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
Another thing is
that I'm a tamer

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
and the shop is filled
with many slimes

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
I've forged contracts with.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
The slimes work just
as much as we do.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Which is why every
employee is required

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
to treat the slimes
as their colleagues.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE C] Monsters
would be our colleagues?

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE D]
But they're slimes.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So this job might
not be the best fit for people

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
who dislike slimes or
have any sort of fear

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
of them.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
If either of those apply to you,
please feel free to leave.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
Also if you don't like
the idea of working

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
for a little kid like me,
then you should leave

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
as well.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE D] Slimes are
monsters, no matter how

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
you slice it.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE E] Taking orders
from a kid? No thanks.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE F]
Sorry, guild master.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE E] Let me know if
another job I'm suited for

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
comes up.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
So I'm guessing both
of you are perfectly fine

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
working under me
and alongside slimes?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That cane and hair ornament.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
Would you mind introducing
yourselves to me, please?

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
If you have any conditions
for your employment,

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
let me know those, too.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
Sure. My name is Fei.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
This is my daughter, Li Ling.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
And the only condition I have
is that you hire us both, sir.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
You two are related?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
[FEI] Yes, though we might
not look it since she takes

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
after her mother.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
Oh, but there is one thing
we should address

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
while I'm on it.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Which is?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Would a bad leg be
a hindrance to this job?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
It's broken, so...

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If it's only broken,
that's nothing the healing

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
slimes can't fix.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Nope. No hindrance at all.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Seriously.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
So. You don't have any
requests regarding pay?

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
No, sir.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
As long as it's enough
to live off of,

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
whatever you give us
will be just fine.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
And what about Miss Li Ling?

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Do you have any requests?

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
If so, then please voice them.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to either live

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
at the shop or an
affordable inn nearby.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
Extra emphasis on
the word "affordable."

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
We're, uh, fairly low on money,
so any cheap lodging will do.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
In that case, you're in luck!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
I have a dormitory
where workers can stay.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
Really? That sounds
perfect for us! Right?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
It sure does.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If I may, I have one
last question for you two.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly answer
whatever you ask.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I appreciate it.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
Just from a glance,
I can tell you both

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
are very strong,
which is why I'm curious.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
What are those weapons you have?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
You have extremely
sharp eyes for a child.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
As you suspect,
my daughter and I are both

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
former assassins.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
You're here to kill?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
I said "former," as in we quit!

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
We don't do it anymore!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
But I highly doubt I was
the only one here

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
who was able to read you.

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
Master Glissela
must've known it, too.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I knew.
Obviously.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
Though these eyes may
be old, I still use them

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
to make my own
assessments about people,

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
especially if it's for
potential business ventures.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You did the
same thing with me!

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
Yes, there are no exceptions.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
Background checks are essential.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
And that goes
double for foreigners.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
They're foreign?

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
When the master we
served lost a war,

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
we lost our jobs and homeland.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
We had to figure out
what we needed to do next

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
in order to survive.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
Then, our journey led us here.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
And, not unlike
our current situation,

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
we needed money,
so we went to work

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
in the mines.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
But I got caught in
a collapse one day,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
and as you can tell,
I have yet to recover.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed that you
realized there's more

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
to them than meets the eye.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.929 position:50% align:center
I thought we were doing
a great job pretending

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
to be normal folks.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
You and the guild master knew.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
The only people
we couldn't deceive.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
You must be quite special
to sense something like that.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
And at such a young age!

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
Do you perhaps hail from
another country as well?

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
No. Couldn't be.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
The feeling's different.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
You're similar to us,
but not quite the same.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
Very strange, indeed.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] What's strange is
that I'm from a foreign world,

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
not country.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
Can't exactly say that, though.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
Anyway. How soon can
the two of you start?

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
So you're still
willing to hire us?

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
Even knowing our past?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
Since the guild master
approves of you,

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
there's nothing for me
to worry about.

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
We thought our former occupation
would blacklist us from any job!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
We have an escape
plan 'n' everything!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
The last thing I would want
you guys to do is escape!

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
I need all the help I can get!

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
Which is why yours
is more than welcome!

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Well, then if that's the case,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
we'd be happy to start
this very instant!

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
Considering your background,
could I ask you

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
to do some bodyguard work, too,
if I ever need it?

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think that
can be arranged!

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
We've got your back,
don't worry!

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that you do!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
Let's make your employment
with us official!

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
working with both of you!

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
[FEI]
The feeling is mutual, Manager.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
This is an absolute pleasure!

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
This business has
a bright future.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
So give it everything you've
got and then some!

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
[FEI, LI LING]
We will.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
And do me a favor by
leaving your damn weapons

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
at home every once in a while.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't be at ease
if I didn't have this.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
It's practically attached.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
When will you grow out
of your assassin habits?

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
They aren't without their flaws,
but then again who is, right?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
Nonetheless, treat them well.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Would've been nice
if you'd told me about

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
those flaws, though.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA laughs]

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
I could have, but I wanted
to see what your eyes

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
were capable of picking up on.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
And while you did
impress me, my peepers

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
could still give you
a run for your money!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
This is the laundry
service, then?

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
It's really beautiful!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
And look at the crowd
that it's attracting!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
You just opened
shop yesterday, right?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
That makes this
crowd even crazier!

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
We're here to work,
so let's hop to it, then!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
We'll both follow your lead.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you guys.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Don't work too hard, though.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
Whatever you can
do'll be enough!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
All set. We'll call
you when it's ready.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
Miss Carla and Mister Callum!
I'm back!

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
That's great!
And you brought reinforcements!

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
These two will be
joining us immediately.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
Please, just call me Fei.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
No need to be formal, after all.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
Li Ling. It's very
nice to meet you.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Hi. My name is Callum Norad.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
And I'm Callum's sister, Carla.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
Let's make this place
the best it can be!

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
All right, Mister Fei.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
Would you mind
working the front?

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna need
Miss Li Ling's help

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
transporting the bags
of laundry back and forth.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
That sounds good.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
Super good!

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
Whoever was next in line,
I can help you right over here!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
You weren't kidding about our
colleagues being slimes!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
So cool.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
Oh! Right. Hello!

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
I'm Li Ling, one of your
most recent coworkers.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you slimes.
Er! Guys!

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
All righty!

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
Time to get to work!

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
Is this the finished
laundry down here?

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
I'll take it to the front!

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Thanks to Mister Fei's
and Miss Li Ling's assistance,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
we were able to get
through the evening rush

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
of customers more
much more efficiently

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
than the previous day.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
[FEI] Li Ling, you're
good at singing, right?

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
[LI LING]
La la la!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA]
Poke. Hey!

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
Stupendous work, everyone!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
You as well, Manager!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
It's such a load off my
shoulders to know we got

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
a big turnout two days in a row.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
And most of the people
who came in this afternoon

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
heard about us from
satisfied customers

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
who recommended they try it too!

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
I expect things to continue
like this for the next few days.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
Maybe longer!

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
I hope you're right!

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
Either way, let's keep
doing our best.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
I think that'll be enough to
ensure this isn't temporary.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
Will you calculate the sales?

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
That'll be your last
task of the day.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Consider it done, sir.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
While those two take
care of the books,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
I'd like for both of you
to please follow me.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
Is there a point to all of this?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
There is!

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Is that Dimension Home?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
So in addition to everything
else, you also use Space magic?

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
[LI LING]
What kind of slimes are those?

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
They're a different
color from all the ones

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
I worked with in the shop.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
These are healing slimes.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's new.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
And look.
Much like their name suggests,

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
they heal injuries of all kinds.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
--You serious?
--Broken legs, too?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yes.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
[FEI gasps]

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
--[RYOMA] How is it?
--Huh? Uh...

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
Oh! It feels completely healed!

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
No pain at all!

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
It's like I'm a whole new man!

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
Check me out!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
I'm sincerely in your debt!

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
It means so much
to have my leg back!

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
Oh, no worries.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
I want my staff to have
decent working conditions.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
Part of my job as your boss.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
You just saved my father
a small fortune!

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
Healing magic
users charge a ton!

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
I had given up on fixing my leg.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
We had to bribe the
guard on the outskirts

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
of your country while
we were fleeing ours,

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
and they took everything we had!

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So that's why you
were broke when you got here.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Our country's border
guards are very greedy.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
It's sad.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
The only choice we had
was to lose our money

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
or lose our lives.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
Why in the world
are you apologizing?

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
The one who healed
my leg and gave us work

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
does not need to bow his
head and tell us he's sorry.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
We're nothing but
grateful for all that 

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
you've done!

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
This will be your room,
Mister Fei.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
And you, Miss Li Ling,

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
are free to use the
room right next door.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
[FEI gasps] What an
absolutely beautiful room!

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
[LI LING]
They're fully furnished, too!

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
We haven't slept
in beds in so long!

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Oh, good.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
We just finished calculating
the sales totals.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.037 position:50% align:center
Thank you, both.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
We made even more the
second day than the first!

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
I predict our sales
will only grow larger

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
once word really
starts to circulate.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Larger than this?

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Yes.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
As I'm sure you know,
Gimul is a mining town.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] Though it's gotten
smaller, it's still home

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
to many miners and
iron mill workers,

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
which are two jobs that
result in very dirty clothes.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Guess that's true.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
There should also be
demand in other towns, too.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
It might be a good idea
to think about where

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
you'd want to put
additional branches.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
It's way too early
to think about that.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
I mean, our shop's only
been open a whopping

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
total of two days.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
It's never too early to think
about these kinds of things!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
If you have somebody
you trust enough

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
to operate a second shop,
then you're already

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
a step ahead of the game!

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
All right. Fine.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
But there are other things
to worry about for now.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
Like, uh...

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Mister Fei and Miss Li Ling.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
They are...

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
They have military
experience, so I thought

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
I'd put that to good
use and employ them

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
as part-time bodyguards.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Wow, military experience
looks great on any resumé!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Please factor in their
second job when calculating

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
--their pay.
--[CARLA] Understood.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
Just when I think you can't
get any more generous,

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
you go and do
something like that!

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA chuckles]

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Thus, day two
of Bamboo Forest Laundry

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
ended on a happy note.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
So, my lady.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
Yet another day
of magic practice?

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
Uh huh.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
Though, if I were further along,

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
I'd come and help you
out at your shop.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's the thought
that counts, right?

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
And there's plenty
of people helping now.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
Well, I wish you luck!

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
And I'll try and
work just as hard!

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Sounds good. See you later!

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
Hope you have a nice day!

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A] I brought
a whole stack again today!

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Mister Callum's
prediction came true,

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
and we were just
as busy the third day.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
It was hard work, to be sure.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
But slimes and humans
alike gave it 110 percent!

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
I was running out of
ways to thank them,

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd bake
them a pizza this time.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
When each of them
took their lunch break,

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
I surprised them with it.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
It's great! Thank you!

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
You're welcome!

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
Meow!

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Your slimes rule! I love them!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
And for good reason!

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
We're gonna practically
shine after this!

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
It's weird something so slimy
makes something so clean.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Meow!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
They make us look great,
they make us smell great,

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
and they make us feel
great while they're

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
in the process of
doing the other two!

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
So I take it you'll come again?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
We got through day three
by having the entire staff

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
work full time.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
Thank you, everyone.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
And same to you.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Good things come in threes,

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
and I guess good
turnouts do too!

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
So, how are our sales looking?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
About one point five
times yesterday's.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
How great is that?

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
It's not great.
It's downright phenomenal!

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
And if you think
you're pleased,

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
talk to the ones
who left here smiling

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
from ear to ear!

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
And it's only gonna get better
with each passing day!

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
Much better and much bigger!

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
You and Mister Fei
think so, too?

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
I guess that means I need
to hire more people, then.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
--And fast.
--[CARLA] Mm-hmm. I would.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
Just to err on the
side of caution.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
I know you were just there,
but I think we'd all

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
benefit if you spoke
to the guild again.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center
Right. I will.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
I think we would also
benefit if we had a cook

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
on staff.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Can the guild help us
out with that as well?

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
But why do we need a cook?

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Everyone's way
too busy to make meals

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
for themselves.

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
[CALLUM] But that sort
of thing can be made part

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
of an employee's side work.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
Enjoying a professionally
cooked meal every day

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
sounds a whole lot
more appealing to me.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Employee welfare at its finest.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
Welfare? What's that mean?

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
I'm not familiar with
that word either.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Oh, I kinda made it up.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
But if I had to define it,
I'd say it's a system

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
in a workplace that
enables employees

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
to work more comfortably.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
Typical Mister Ryoma,
putting so much thought

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
into the treatment
his staff members are given.

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of an
employer like you before.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
Live-in work and generous pay?

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
I don't see how it could
get any better!

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
You've spoiled us to the
point where I don't think

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
we can work for anyone else!

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
That makes me happier
than you know.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Okay! My next stop is
the Merchant's Guild,

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.927 position:50% align:center
and then I'm heading
home for the night.

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
I trust you guys
will close up shop.

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Of course. Have a good night.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA] So business is
surpassing your expectations

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
and you need another new hire?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
Since the funds just
keep on coming,

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's the
smartest move to make

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
at this point.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's very smart.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
How many workers
are you looking for?

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
I need three regular employees.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
And I'd also like to request
that you provide me

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
with one cook who
makes meals for the rest

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
of the staff.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
Wait, you want a cook?

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
Ha! Quite a fascinating
choice, eh?

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
Is it something you
don't see too often?

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
I've seen it, but it's
usually done by someone

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
who's already employed.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Mister Callum
suggested that, too.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
But, still. I prefer wolves.

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
Don't you?

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
A wolf who knows their
stuff would definitely

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
make that food taste
a million times better.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
I'll see what I can
find for you, dear.

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Oh, before you do that...

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA]
I know, I know.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
I'm putting at least five
gold stars by the part

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
on the application that says

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
"must be good with
kids and slimes,"

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
so we won't be beating
around the bush this time.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
You're the best.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
The next day...

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
[FINA] Hello!
Nice to meet you, I'm Fina.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
And my name is Maria.

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm Jane!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
And I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
I'm the manager
of Bamboo Forest.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
At such a young age?

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
So amazing!

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
You can say that again!

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
These three ladies traveled
from the same village

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
in search of more job
opportunities here in Gimul.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
--I see.
--And onto the next!

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you.
Please, call me Selma.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
I used to work as a cook
at a quaint, little inn.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Thank you all for coming.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Everyone here agreed
to live in your dormitory

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
while working under
you and alongside

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
your slimes.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
So once you give your approval,
they're good to go!

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
Really? Then I approve!

Welcome to the laundry biz!

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Thanks very much, Manager!

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA]
Oh. By the way, Ryoma.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
If your little business
continues to grow like this,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
perhaps you should
consider branching out

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
and setting up a sister shop
or two in different towns.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
When you're ready
to take that step,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
come and talk to me.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
I'm nowhere near ready!

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
You're plenty ready, boy.

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
In fact, we could
do it right now.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
One week's passed
since our grand opening.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
The customers seem
extremely happy.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
And everyone on the
team does a great job.

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:30.248 position:50% align:center
Ms. Selma's cooking
is delicious!

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I hired her!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
With a cook and seven
employees to help

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
lighten my workload,
I was able to dedicate

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
some time to landscaping
and really spruce up

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:49.684 position:50% align:center
the place.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
Now that we're so well staffed,

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't have to
be here as much anymore.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll take on some jobs
at the Adventurer's Guild.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
I already had
sky-high expectations.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center
Yet he still went
above and beyond.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
I suppose he'll do just
fine living by himself

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
in this town. Right?

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
He will.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
If anyone can do it, it's him.
