00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.094 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] This is the mining
town of Gimul.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
Up until the Jamil family
invited me to tag along

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
with them, I'd never left
my home in the forest.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
I've lived in Seilfall
for three years now,

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
but this is my very first time
visiting an actual town.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
Although it's called
a "mining town,"

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
the mines haven't been
yielding what they used to,

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
and unfortunately, it's been
that way for a few years.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
That's one of the reasons
Mister Reinhart

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
came here in the first place.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
He wants to assess
the mines and decide

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
which ones they should
keep in operation

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
and which they
should close down.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
And me?
I'm just happy to be here.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I found out I needed
an item referred to

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
as a status board.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
So I went with Reinhart
and his family

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.949 position:50% align:center
to a church to get it.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
In case the name
didn't give it away,

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
a status board displays
a person's stats.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
It also serves as a form of ID.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
[NUN A] Ah. So you're here
to receive a status board?

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
Well then.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
Please follow me
to the baptism room.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
Young man, I present your
status board to you.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
A few more steps and the
baptism will be complete.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
Just place your board on
the pedestal and then touch

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
the crystal.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
Sounds easy enough.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
'Sup, Ryoma!

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
So great to see
you again, though!

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Gain! Kufo! Lulutia!

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me I died again.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
Ah, okay.
So I'm still alive.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center
What a relief!

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
Your mind simply took
a quick little journey

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
to our side for a moment.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
You'll be back where you
were soon as you leave.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
I thought meeting again
wouldn't be possible.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
So how...?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
The church should
be your first stop

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
as soon as you make
it to the town.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Don't dillydally too much, okay?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
You'll have an oracle skillset.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
So you'll be able to
communicate with us gods

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
by using it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
I remember you said that.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
But I never went to a town
or used the skill.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
Even without going to a church,

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
you led what many
would consider to be

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
a priestly life.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
Rain or shine,
you prayed to us every day

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
for three years straight!

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
And because of your devotion,

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
we were still able to
give you the oracle skill

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
so we could meet like this.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
We'll try to keep it brief,
but we should be able

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
to communicate from now on.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
But I don't mind
if it's not brief.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
Either way, I'm happy you
finally went to a church

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
so we can talk!

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
The house you built
was totally amazing!

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
Yes, I must agree!

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
And I do believe that you
have the cleanest,

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
best-smelling toilet in
the history of Seilfall!

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that's mostly because
of the slimes, not me.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
Well, yes and no.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
Though the cleaner
and scavenger slimes

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
keep things spotless.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
Their species was
actually invented by you.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] No wonder Reinhart
and the others never

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
heard of them before.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
Though the initial creator
of slimes is yours truly.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Really?

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
[GAIN]
Yes, really.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
I gave them the ability to
adapt to the environment

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
and reproduce based on that.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
Their evolutionary
possibilities were infinite.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
But certain environments
only have so many features,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
and once a few species emerged,

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
they stopped branching
out into new types.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
You could say they
were "set in slime."

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
You rediscovered
the slimes' potential

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
that even their very
creator had forgotten.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
If I wore a hat,
I'd be tipping it to you.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
Oh. Gee whiz.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
Getting praised by
the duke and his family

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
was one thing, but getting
praised by a god

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
is a whole new level entirely.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
Now, now.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
Like everyone else,
gods have their strengths

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
and weaknesses.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
Out of all the families
in Seilfall,

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
who would've thought
the one you'd encounter

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
would be the Jamils!

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
Is that rare, or?

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
I'd say so!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
You're not the first person
we transferred

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
to that world, you know.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
A previous Earthling
married an ancestor

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
of the Jamil family!

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] That's right.
I remember her fondly.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
What a sweetheart she was.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[KUFO]
Yeah! Super nice girl.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
Her big dream was to learn
how to train animals.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
So she asked us
for a skill that would

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
allow her to tame them.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
Pretty smart, huh?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
So she wanted all of that.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
And she was also a Jamil?

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
She was the one who
researched and created

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
the taming school of magic!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
[LULUTIA] She had many
achievements in her lifetime,

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
including being given
the title of a noble.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
Then the Jamil ancestor
fell in love with her

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
and they were happily married.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] We've been giving
our individual blessings

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
to their descendants ever since,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
making sure to keep
the taming ability strong

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
within their bloodline.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
Young Eliaria in
particular has inherited

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
quite a bit from her predecessor
who was originally from Earth.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
If that's true,

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
it would mean that she's
a naturally gifted tamer,

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
like it's in her blood.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
That won't do,
because I'm the one

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
who chose to become a tamer!

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
I should put in the
work for it myself!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It's good to know
all of her hard work

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
will eventually pay off.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
Actually, no,
the side she inherits

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
most strongly from
is her mother's.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
So it's not the Jamil side.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
Wait, then.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
Her mother's side has
someone who transferred

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
from Earth, too?

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
Whenever we take
magic from Earth,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
we make it a point
to transfer at least

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
one person along with it.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
Is there a chance
I'll meet one of them?

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
Not likely, since there's
usually at least two centuries

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
between transfers.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Unless you or they live
to be over 200 years old,

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
I really just don't
see that happening.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
If you ever bother
to look "otaku" up

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
in the dictionary,
you'll see the face

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
of Eliaria's other relative.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
Wow. That bad?

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] He wished for
strong magical powers

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
and used them to become
unstoppable in combat.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
Above all, his fire attacks
were truly a marvel

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
to behold.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
[LULUTIA] Thankfully,
he was extremely timid.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
Thus, he was never
driven to use his

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
overwhelming power for
any sort of evil deeds.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
We may be the ones
who gave him those powers,

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
but that didn't stop
us from worrying

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
till the day he died.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
I imagine he must've been
quite the handful, huh?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
In comparison to you?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
You're like a dream
while he was a nightmare!

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.157 position:50% align:center
Oh. That so?

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
Every decision that you
make is calm and rational.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
You follow the rules
and try different things.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center
But you stay in your lane.

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
You, my son, are the pinnacle
of transferees,

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
and Seilfall is
blessed to have you!

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
Did you say "son?"

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
I am kinda like
a heavenly father.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
Calling you my son
felt godly to me.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
Um... Thanks, Dad.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
I should be thanking you.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't be nearly
as entertained without you.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
It's almost time to go.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
But that was so fast!

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, we'll still
be watching over you.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
One more thing to note
is that some other gods

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
have noticed you.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
Uh, other gods?
What other gods?

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Seems you've caught
the eye of the god of war

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
as well as the god of magic.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
It's quite the triumph since
they often don't care

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
for your kind.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
Oh, and another tidbit
is the god of crafts

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
and artisans has given
his blessing to you!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
What? He did?

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm glowing.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
Guess that means it's
time to say goodbye.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
We'll be able to meet
with you like this

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
whenever you visit the church.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
Well, bye. I'll see you soon!

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
Take it easy out there!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
You're extraordinary
in every way.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
The three of us
will continue to watch

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
every step of your journey
until our paths cross again!

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
You may now observe the
status of your status board.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
With the exception of
your name, age, and race,

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
it's customary to hide
what's written there.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure it's not
difficult to see why.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
Very private information.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
Then I shall take
my leave of you.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
Everyday skillsets,
and combat skillsets, too.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
Then there's my magic skillsets.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
Crafting. Special.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
Huh? Title?

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
Holds the titles of
"Overcoming an Unhappy Life"

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
and "Beloved Child of the Gods."

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Welcome back, Mister Ryoma!

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] It seems to have
worked out problem-free.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
If it's all the same to you,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
I'd like to impart a
word of advice.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
I am your elder, after all.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What kind of advice?

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Compared to other children
in your age group,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
your abilities are
remarkably high.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
That means you'll attract
a lot of unwanted attention.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
Especially from people
who would seek

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center
to use you for their own ends.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
If you can keep
your strengths hidden,

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
you may be able to avoid this.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
Given how prominent
your abilities are,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
I realize concealing them
will be a rather tall task.

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
That's why I suggest
you register early

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
at a guild instead.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Because the sooner
you raise your rank,

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
the sooner you can
increase your standing.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
My, uh, standing?

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
You're extremely talented,
yet you're still so young.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
Which means it's
obvious that you have

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
the blessings of the gods.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
So please watch out.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
Depending on what the blessing
is, people will hunt you.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If that's the way
this world works, so be it.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
Glad I know now.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
I'll just control myself
and refrain from using

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
too much magic in
front of others.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
I'll be careful. I promise.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
You, uh, you look like you
have a question for me.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
I do. It's just...

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
I'm wondering what your
total magic capacity is.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
Let me think.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
198,000 sounds right.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
Your capacity total is so high.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
And you're somehow
able to use so much

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
of your magic.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
Well, the higher the capacity,
the more magic I can use, right?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
No, that's not what I meant!

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
I was trying to say you can
use the magic appropriately.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
Oh! Can I?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon,
but perhaps Mister Ryoma

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
is unaware of the
side effects, Miss.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You think?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
And what side effects are those?

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
Simple.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
People who have
higher magic capacities

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
typically have a hard time
controlling their powers

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
and learning new things.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
For the most part,
these people are required

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
to train in order
to limit their magic,

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
otherwise they cannot
use it in the correct way.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
That's good to know.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Wish it were something
I'd known sooner.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
Up until now,

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
I had no one to
compare magic with,

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
so I didn't realize
that was the case.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
I hope you know
it's really impressive

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
how you're able to use
magic so easily.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
I'm the exact same age as you,
but I can't use magic very well.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What's your capacity?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
That's the thing.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
My magic capacity
is around 200,000.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That's a lot!

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] She's got me
beat by a landslide!

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
She did have that
one otaku ancestor.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
I bet that's where it's from.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
You must have really
good genes, huh?

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
Could you please explain
to me how you got

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
so competent at using magic?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
Well I can try.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
The best advice I can
think to give you

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
is to just play around
with it until eventually

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
you teach yourself.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
So I just play around?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
That's all?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Start off with some basic magic,

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
then do whatever
you can think of

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
and go from there.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
What an idea.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
I've never thought
of using magic

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
as a sort of plaything before.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
No harm in trying it, is there?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
Even if she spends some
magic on goofing around,

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.438 position:50% align:center
Elia should still have
plenty left over for training,

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
so play away.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
I can teach you any time.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
It's a promise, then!
I'm looking forward to it!

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It shouldn't be a
big deal, and I know that.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
But I can't deny how good
it feels to be appreciated

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
like this.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Wibble wobble.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
Wibble wibble wobble!

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA giggles]

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
This could support
one hundred of me!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] After leaving the
church, we made our way

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
to the Tamer's Guild.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
I came to learn it was
the official society

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
for those with the power
to control monsters,

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
also known as tamers
and summoners.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
The guild's primary purpose
is to provide job offers

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
and information to all
of its members.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
Once we finally arrived,
Lady Eliaria and I

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
both registered as tamers,

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
just like we
initially planned on.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
But...

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH]
Hmm...

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
I never would've thought
it'd be such an ordeal

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
to raise his rank.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
It was truly unexpected.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] There was a new
trend in the Tamer's Guild.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
And that trend was
letting the strength

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
of the monsters determine
the overall skill

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
of their masters.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
Since I'm a slime specialist
and slimes are at the bottom

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
of the food chain, my rank
was going nowhere fast.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
Is there nothing we can
do to raise his rank?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
We should head over to the
Adventurer's Guild for now.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
But why would we go there?

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
You said you took
down some bandits

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
in the forest, didn't you?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
He may be onto something.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
That guild values survival
skills as well as 

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
combat abilities.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's right
up your alley.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
I say we give it a try!

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
Um... Okay.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
If I want to register at
the Adventurer's Guild,

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
my combat skills have
to be tested, right?

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Do you think I should give
it everything I've got?

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] Yes, that would
be a wise choice.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
Mister Ryoma!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
I'm rooting for you!

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
I take it you're today's
lucky applicant?

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
That's me. Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's begin.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
To start,

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
take five of your arrows
and shoot those five targets.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna see you
waste a single shot.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Got it.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If I'm gonna live up
to their expectations,

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
I have to do this.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN whistles]

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
Five bullseyes in a row.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
Pretty slick, kid.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I did spend a lot of
time hunting in the forest.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
Maybe that helped.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
That was wonderful!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
It was just... wow!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
Yes. It was.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
The bow and arrows they
gave him must've been

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
the best of the best!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I believe
you're confused.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
That was Mister Ryoma's skill,

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
not the work of
the tools he used.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
In that case, he just keeps
getting more and more amazing!

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
I'll say.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
But who knew he'd be that adept?

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
You'd think after all the
times he's surprised us,

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
we'd stop
underestimating the boy.

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Next up is moving targets.

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Discs will come
flying out of there.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So it's like an archery
version of skeet shooting.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
This style of test was
first designed long ago

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
by an adventurer known as Kengo.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
He was famous because
of his unique weapon,

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
a magic item called "Shotgun."

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
He called it shotgun?

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
Kengo was definitely
a transferee.

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
But what kind of guy brings
a gun to a world of magic?

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
Shoot 50 targets with 50 arrows.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
Do your best, kid.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
Wow. Just look at
him concentrate.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
Almost there!

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
Four targets at once?

00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
Earth Needle!

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Stop! You win! I surrender!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
The test is officially over.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
I moved on instinct.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
I noticed.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
But no need to apologize.

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
That's just something
I do to keep people

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
on their toes.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
A cautionary experience,
if you will.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Ahh.
It's completely dulled down.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
I guess that was a pop quiz.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
I've seen people dodge
the knife in the past.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
But you're the first
applicant who had the stones

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
to strike back.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
It is nice to make
your acquaintance.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
I'm the Master
of the Gimul branch

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
of the Adventurer's Guild.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
Name's Worgan.

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Why would the guild
master be in charge

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
of running the tests?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
It's not that strange.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
You know what is, though?

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
The duke's whole family's here!

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
I couldn't let just anybody
run this thing

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
with such well-to-do
spectators in the audience,

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
now could I?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Point taken.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
He aced it like a regular pro.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Mister Ryoma!

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Careful, my lady!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
That's it.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
You're hereby registered
as a member

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
of the Adventurer's Guild.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
You get a card and everything.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
Thank you! So much!

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
Why Rank G?

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
Given the skills
that you showed me,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
I could probably let you
start off at rank E.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
But there's other
things to consider.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
Like what some
people might do if I

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
start you off too high.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
So begin at G
and work your way up.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
Show everyone and their
grandma what you can do.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
Keep at it, and you'll
increase your rank

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
in no time.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being so
thoughtful about this.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Ay, knock it off with that crap.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
You honestly shouldn't
waste your time being

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
so polite with me.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
Save your breath.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway,
now that you're a member

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
of the guild and all that,
why don't you go

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
take a look and see what
jobs have been posted?

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE]
Generally speaking.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
If it's not the same
rank as you,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
it's not a job you're
allowed to accept.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
Getting a party to go with
you is an exception, though.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
The same goes for getting
recruited by other guilds.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
Those are cases where you can
take on jobs with higher ranks.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That makes sense.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE] The board for
rank G jobs is over there.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
They need the communal
bathroom spruced up.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
And there's a housecleaning
one over here.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
The trash would
include food waste,

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
as well as timber and debris.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
If I have the scavenger
slimes eat the garbage,

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
and the cleaner slimes
do what they do best...

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
All right!

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
We got ourselves a job!

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
And the next day...

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
Everyone! Come!

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
We have our first
guild assignment!

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
Have a nice day, Mister Ryoma!

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You as well!

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
This must be it.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
Cool! I'm a working
man once again!

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
Are they not home?

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!
I'm from the Adventurer's Guild!

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
I heard you needed
some things cleaned?

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
You! Are you pulling my tail,
or are you really here

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
to clean?

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
a cat beastkin before!

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ugh...

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
I can definitely smell rotten
food coming from there.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
Hello...

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
My name is Ryoma Takebayashi,

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
and I've been sent from
the Adventurer's Guild.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
You came!

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
I'd almost given up hope.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
But now, you're finally
here to clean my house!

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you for coming!
Really!

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
Please, feel free
to call me Miya, okay?

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
