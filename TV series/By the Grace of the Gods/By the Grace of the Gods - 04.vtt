00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.885 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] My first job as a member
of the Adventurer's Guild

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.138 position:50% align:center
was to clean a house
filled with trash.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
A lot of trash.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.308 position:50% align:center
Turns out there was
a dump right next door,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
and one day a whole pile
of goodness knows

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
what came crashing
into the basement

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
thanks to unstable ground.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
The garbage kept pouring
in faster than anyone

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
could clean it,
until it got to the point

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
where nobody was willing
the give the job

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.823 position:50% align:center
a second thought.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
After all,
who in their right mind

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
would wanna clean
a never-ending pile

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
of trash?

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
Once I heard the full story,
it made me wonder why she chose

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
to build her house here.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.006 position:50% align:center
Poor life choices aside,
I decided to start

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
with the trash
in the dump first.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
Cut the problem off at the root.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
It's time! Maximize!

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
Now, break apart!

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
To kick things off,
I had the scavenger slimes

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
eat their hearts out.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Mist Wash, go!

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.634 position:50% align:center
I did the same in the
basement and cleaned it.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
Next, I used Create Block
to make bricks.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.935 position:50% align:center
Then I combined said bricks
with the hardening solution

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:43.895 position:50% align:center
from the sticky slimes
to fill the massive hole

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
in the dump's wall.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
That was it.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.900 position:50% align:center
The slimes formed an assembly
line and got to work.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.030 position:50% align:center
Finally. Done!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.157 position:50% align:center
It looked daunting,
but we managed to finish

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.617 position:50% align:center
in just a few hours.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
Good work! Seriously!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
Whatcha think?

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
It's...

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
It's...?

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I made her cry!

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
[MIYA crying]

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
It's absolutely purr-fect!

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
And so clean!

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
You even fixed the hole!

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
I'm so touched!

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough!

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
You're welcome.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
I wasn't expecting her
to be so happy.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Like, me-wow! Thank you so much!

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
So, um... Miss Miya?

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
Is it safe to assume this
job's been completed

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
to your liking?

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
Way more than safe!

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
Then could you please
sign on the dotted line?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] Meow can I thank
you for all that you've

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
done for me?

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
I know!
I'll raise your reward pay!

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
You've earned it,
that's fur sure!

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
Oh! Thank you so much!

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
[MIYA giggles]

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
With one job under my belt,

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
I not only felt a sense
of accomplishment,

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
but a sense of comfort in
knowing I could make it

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
on my own in this world.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
I went to report my success
with my head held high

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
and a smile on my face.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
You already cleaned up
that colossal mountain

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
of garbage?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
Fantastic! Truly!

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
And you did it so fast!

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
All in a day's work.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE]
Well, hard work pays off.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
Um, I don't think that's mine.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
I promise you it is.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
It says right here
in black and white

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
that Miya wanted to greatly
increase your reward.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
I do remember her saying that.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
But it's too much!

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE]
Not according to Miya,

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
so don't be modest
and just take it.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
It's yours.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
Your hard work made
someone very happy,

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
and this is her way
of showing her thanks.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE]
Excellent!

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Now sign here.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Ryoma.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
There's not a speck
of dirt in Miya's house,

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
and it's all thanks to you.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
So do you know Miss Miya
from somewhere?

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
She's an adventurer,
just like you and me.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Man.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
There was so much
trash in that place,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
I didn't think anybody
could clean it up.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
What's your secret?

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
No secrets. Just slimes.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Oh. I also know magic
that was perfect for it.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
That helped.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Well, then.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
If you're looking
for another job,

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
there's something else I might
need your expertise for.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] You want the
communal toilet cleaned.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
Don't you?

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN] Of course you'd
already be one step ahead.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
I happened to see it
when I was checking out

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center
the jobs board.

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
Then that'll make this easy.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
The job in question was issued
by the town government.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wow.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
They refused to pay
people to clean,

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
and everything
literally went to crap.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
Not sure if you know,
but Gimul's finances

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
have been on a steady decline.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
I heard it was something
to do with the iron mines

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
producing less ore than
they did in the past.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
So to try and
ease the situation,

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
they cut down on spending,

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
starting with the town's
management fees.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
The slum dwellers in this town--

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
They were the ones
originally in charge

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
of keeping the toilets sanitary.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
But the government officials
wanted to dock their pay,

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
so they made up
some bogus excuses

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
to justify doing it,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
saying they weren't
working hard enough.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
I'm aware those
people need money.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
But they're not gonna
work if they're not

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
getting fairly paid.

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
You get it, right?

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Yes.
It's a truly terrible thing.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
Their CEOs are exploiting them.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Huh? What's a CEO?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Uhh... nothing! I just
understand the situation.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
Very well, in fact.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
You can count on me.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, I'll get to work.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
Thank you, kid.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure
you're compensated!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Well...

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of telling Mister
Reinhart about this, too.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
He could probably step in
and do something.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
Change things for
the better, you know?

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
Oh? Could he now?

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I was nothing but
a stranger to all of them.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
Yet they still took me
under their wing

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
and chose to help me.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
Well then.
I'll keep my hopes up.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
So I took the job.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
How could I not after
hearing that story?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
That means...

00:07:58.895 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
Sebas.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
Sir?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
Costs in the town
were unchanged.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
At least, according to an
official report, they were.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
If what Ryoma tells us is true,

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
then I highly suspect
there may be some

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
embezzlement going on here.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
Find out.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
Your wish is my command.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
I owe you thanks.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Crimes committed in
the shadows might finally

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
be brought into the
light because of you.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I hope so.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
To think money that should
be used for the town

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
is being stolen by
those in charge.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
It's unforgivable to
knowingly take away

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
from the pockets
of their people!

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
Does all the work I put in
mean nothing to them?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
Father had put forth the
idea of communal toilets

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
as well as hiring the
people of the slums

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
to maintain them.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
For the environmental and
employment benefits, both.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
The less fortunate got
jobs and a public place

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
was kept clean.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
That's really clever of you.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I honestly had no clue.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
You all can rest assured.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
We will get to the
bottom of this.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
I believe you.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
So you and your slimes
have another job.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
I wish you the best
of luck in completing it!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
We'll all do our best.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That is one intense stench.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
The next day, it was off
to the pits for me

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
and my slimes to clean the
notoriously dirty toilets.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
Each and every stall
was seven meters wide

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
and two kilometers long.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
And there were 30 of them.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
This is gonna take a whole
lot of work, you guys.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
So we'll just tackle 'em
one at a time.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
That oughta do it.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
Everybody ready? We're goin' in.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
Three! Two! One!

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
Go!
Do your thing, scavenger slimes!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
Mist Wash.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
Now to disinfect.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
A little lightning magic.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Squall!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
Ah. One down, 29 to go.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
That took longer than
I thought it would.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Ah well. On to the next.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
Our work here is far from over.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
You've gotten to eat
more than your fill

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
both today and yesterday.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
But the more the merrier.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
Statistically, it should
make the work go faster.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Okay. Monster Appraisal.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Monster Appraisal is a
nifty type of taming magic

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
that displays a monster's
skills and special

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
attributes to its master.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
Their poison resistance
is off the charts!

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
And that's not all!

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
Now they can resist miasma, too?

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
Which could only mean...

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
There was a crap ton of
miasma built up in here!

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] Collect seven and
your wish will come true!

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I have a couple more than seven.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
I'm slipping!

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You're fine.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
No, I'm not!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yes, you are.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN yells]

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I rushed over to
the Adventurer's Guild.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
And I was greeted by none
other than the Jamil family.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
They were there to get
more info from Worgan.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
Miasma?

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
A buildup?

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
Yes. At least there's
an upside, though.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
We caught it before
it leaked from the area.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
But were you not affected
while you were there?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm good to go!

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
I took precautions
and cleaned myself

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
with the slimes
before I got here.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
I am fully aware of how
dangerous miasma can be.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't spread it.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
No, Mister Ryoma!

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
That wasn't what she meant!

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
You aren't feeling
feverish or ill

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
in any sort of way, right?

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
Tell us if you feel
even a little sick.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
I'm just fine.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the concern,
though, so thank you.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Kinda strange to have
people genuinely worry over me.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
So. Miasma is a very
destructive magic power

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
that can harm a person
physically and mentally.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
If all of the toilet pits
are polluted with it...

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
Guild Master?

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
If it's all right with you,

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
I'd like to handle this myself
before anyone gets hurt.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
You're gonna chance going
in there to keep cleaning,

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
knowing there's miasma
all around you?

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
In order to get rid of it,
we need to cut off the source.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
So please.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
Do everything you can
to keep that area

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
off limits until it's
thoroughly sanitized.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
I guess that can be arranged.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Doesn't this plan endanger
Mister Ryoma's life?

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
True.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
There's no need for him
to put himself at risk.

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
We'll fix this mess
some other way.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I'm very grateful that
you're all worried about me.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
But the fewer people
involved, the better.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
Because a higher number
of people means

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
a higher chance of infection.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
That's why letting my slimes
and me handle things

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
is the safest choice we have.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can stay
outside and let the slimes

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
do most of the work?

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
That sounds like an even
safer choice, to me.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
They can't do this on their own.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
I have to help out
with high areas.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
They can't reach the upper
walls and ceilings.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
Wait! But still!

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
It's okay. I'll prove it.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
I have various resistances

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
and other skills that make
it harder for me to die.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
So even if I were
exposed to miasma,

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
I sincerely doubt it would
take me very long

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
to recover.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
My slimes and I, we...
We have to try.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
We're perfectly suited for it.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
It's up to us.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Placing such a burden on
your shoulders feels terrible.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
But I thank you.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll go ahead
and get started now.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
You've got this!
And count on us to keep watch!

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
Stay sharp!
Don't let anyone get through!

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
--[ASAGI] Naturally.
--[MIZELIA] Of course!

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
Guys. Let's go.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
And just like that, the slimes
and I recommenced

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
our cleaning of
the public toilet pits.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Worgan hired a handful of
adventurers to keep watch

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
while we worked,
ensuring the civilians

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
kept a safe distance
from the danger.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
First, there was Jeff Grange.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
He and Worgan go way back.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
Then the dragonewt, Asagi.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
And a monster researcher
by the name of Leipin.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
[WELANNA]
Leipin!

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
And the dog beastkin, Welanna.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
The tiger beastkin, Mizelia.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
As well as a rabbit
beastkin, Cilia.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
And last but definitely not
least, there was Miya Catt.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
I'm determined to lend Ryoma
a helping paw whenever I can!

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
So! Just leave it to me!

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
If no one's allowed in,
then I'll make sure

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
not even the rats get through!

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
[hissing]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.772 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The number of scavenger
slimes reached a thousand

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
following the split
at the first toilet pit.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
So instead of being
a "Huge" slime

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
when they joined up,
they were now a "King."

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
The king scavenger slime
possessed a skill

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
I'd never heard
of called "Gluttony."

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
It really sped things up,
so we were finished faster

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
than I thought we'd be.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
We were told to not
let anyone pass.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
That includes the duke
and his family, ma'am.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Yes. I understand. But...

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
We brought food.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
Right here.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.020 position:50% align:center
We have some potions, too.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
Please. Make sure
Mister Ryoma gets them.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
Right. Will do.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't you think it's
time you took a break?

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
Nobody would hold it
against you if you took

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
a quick cat nap.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
You've been at it
for a while now.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
You should work
smarter, not harder.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the concern.
But no.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
I wanna take care
of this as fast as I can.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
Halfway through already!

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
He really is quite an
extraordinary young man.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm not the least bit
surprised Worgan took

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
such a liking to him.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
He's the best!

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The number of
scavenger slimes tripled,

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
coming to a grand
total of 3,033.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
I wound up splitting them
into groups of 1,011

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
and then had them
combine as Kings

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
to boost productivity.

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Just two left.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
So close, I can smell it.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Finally, on the
morning of the third day...

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
It is finished.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
You, sir, are nothing
short of brilliant!

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
You're not queasy
or in pain, are you?

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
Nah. I feel good!

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
I'm so proud!
You did another bang-up job!

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Thank boob. I mean you!

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
All 30 toilets have been
cleaned and sanitized.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
It's safe now.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
No more miasma.
I guarantee it.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
Excellent work.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
You deserve a nice,
long rest, kid!

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
I'll see you get the pay
you've earned, too.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Oh, man. I'm beat.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Working until sunrise.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
It's been a while.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
Back then, working this late
was something I did daily.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
Hi, Mom. I'm home.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, Sweetheart.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] No matter how many
times I told her not to,

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
my mom made sure
to stay up so she could

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
greet me the second I walked in.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
She must've been
as tired as I was,

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
considering she stayed
up just as late.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Then, she fell asleep for good.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
Most people would've cried,
but no tears came.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
It just felt like I had a big,
aching hole in my heart.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
I'm home.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It felt lonely to come
home to an empty apartment

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
after work.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
But eventually,
I got used to it.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Guess that happens
when you do something

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
long enough.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I'd ever
get back what I lost.

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
How could I?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I'm home.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
So glad you're back!

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
Yes! Welcome!

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Welcome! And well done,
might I add.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you're safe.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
Please, let me take
your things, sir.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
I have a piping hot
meal ready for you.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
Shall I draw you a
bath before you eat?

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
You okay? You seem shocked.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
What? Why in Seilfall
are you crying?

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you
got sick after all.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
No.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
I just suddenly got hit
by a wave of nostalgia.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
I remembered how my
family used to greet me.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
Just like this.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I'm sorry.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine. I promise.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA crying]

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
Aww. There, there.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You think of us as your family?

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
I couldn't keep my tears inside.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
The warmth I thought
I lost so long ago?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
That I thought I'd
never feel again?

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
It was back.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
In that moment, I was
completely surrounded by it.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
And little by little,
it filled a forgotten hole

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
in my chest.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Good night to you.
Or good day.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
Whichever you prefer, I guess.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
Sweet dreams.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
 Thanks, my lady.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Coming to this world
was one of the best things

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
that could've happened to me.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.418 position:50% align:center
I'm happy here.

00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
Really happy.
