00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
Are you almost done?

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
Just a little longer.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
In that case, perhaps I should
go and wake Mister Ryoma.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's a good idea!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
Thank you, my lady.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
You really woke up early
to cook this spread for us?

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Yes. But not by myself.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
Mother and the maids helped too.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
Because, uh...

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
She has a bit of a favor
to ask you, Ryoma.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
I do. Um...

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
If you could please
teach me how to play

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
with my magic today...

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
I did promise, after all.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
Magic play? Sounds fun.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
So the reason you made
breakfast was to ask me that?

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
Kind of.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
Then I'll eat it all!
Every bite!

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
So how is it?

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
Tastes great!

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:17.827 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
What a relief!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center
He's not kidding,
it's really good.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's harder to fail
at cooking ham and eggs

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
then it is to make it right.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.966 position:50% align:center
Since you're still
learning as well,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.386 position:50% align:center
is there anything that
you'd like to be taught?

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
Magic-wise? Let's see.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.766 position:50% align:center
I'd really love to learn
some attack magics!

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] Then I know just
the instructor for you.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL]
And that'd be me.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
Just say the word,
and I'll teach!

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I really appreciate
it, Mister Camil.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA] I'm ready to learn the
proper way to play with magic!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] So, the types
of magics you excel at

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
are fire and ice,
right, my lady?

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Yes!

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
That's not problematic, is it?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
Well, those two aren't exactly
the easiest to play with.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
Like the only thing
you can do with ice

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
is make sculptures.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
As for fire... Darkness.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
Just watch, you'll see
what I mean.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
Little Fire Flower.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
Beautiful!

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
What did you think of that?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.623 position:50% align:center
It started off pretty,
but there was this sad feeling

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
by the end.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's somehow sentimental.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Sparklers do tend
to have that effect.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!
You use water magic, too.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
So let's test the waters.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
I'll admit that it's
not my strongest,

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
but I'll at least try!

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
Okay, now watch and learn.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Bubbly Water!

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Breeze.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
What an interesting trick.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
Bubbly Water
magic's the real trick.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
It makes the water sticky
so the bubbles form.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
I'll keep that in mind!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
Bubbly Water!

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
Breeze.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
Mine all broke apart so quickly,

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
but yours are still
up in the air.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
Try again, but picture
sticky slimes this time.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
Well, not the slimes.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
But that gooey solution
they create.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
Gooey stuff. Right.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Bubbly Water!

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
And Breeze.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
Wow! Look at 'em go!

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
Well done, honey!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If you practice enough,
you can do something

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
like this, too.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
Bubbly Water.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
Breeze, go.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Oh, neat!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
Here. You too, my lady!

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
Wow.
Must take a lot to break it.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
That's because I put in
some extra magic power

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
that makes them stickier
and harder to burst.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
More power? I see.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You know,

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
it looks like a giant
slime that can float.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Now she's really
playing, just like I hoped

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
she would.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL chuckles]
There!

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
What do you say we
mix things up a little bit?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
Watch. Water...

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
Wave.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
This technique allows you to
change the shape of your water.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You made a fish!

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
And the sky's its sea!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Marvelous!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
As impressive as ever!

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL] What's it like to be
in that head of yours?

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
Well, m'lady. Whatcha think?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
I think I absolutely adore
playing with my magic!

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
Thanks for teaching me!

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm just
glad I could help.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Come on! You can do it!

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
I'm trying!

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Shall we begin your
lesson, then?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Uh, sure!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
Ready when you are.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
You said you wanted to learn
fire attack magic, right?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
Fire Arrow!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
Anybody with a fire
element would be familiar

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
with this attack.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
It's useful, so it's
also quite popular.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
Let me try.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
Okay! Now!

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Fire Arrow!

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center
Only one try and you got it.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll move on, then!

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
Water Shot!

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] After Fire Arrow, Mister
Camil taught me Water Shot,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
Rock Bullet, Ice Arrow,
Stun Arrow, and Wind Hammer.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
I also learned some defensive
magic, like Fire Wall,

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
Water Wall, Wind Shield.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
And last but not least,
Ice Shield.

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
This is great!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
So, what's next?

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
Well, you already picked up
every single magic attack

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
I wanted to teach you today.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
So, nothing's next.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] If you're still eager to
learn, I could teach you

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
some space magic.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
You don't mind?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
No. Not at all.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
It looks like you're in luck.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
You can say that again!

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
Now, please do tell,
Mister Ryoma,

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
is Item Box the only
kind of space magic

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
that you're familiar with?

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
I also know Teleport.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] Would you be so kind
as to demonstrate for us?

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
Teleport, go!

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
So how was that?

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
Quite wonderful.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
I believe you're ready to take
on intermediate space magic.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
Meaning techniques like
Dimension Home and Warp.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
Wow, seriously?!

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
Yes. I kid you not.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Every kind of space
magic is essentially

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
the same in theory.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
So, for example, take warp.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
As long as you have
a solid mental image

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
of your destination,

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
you can travel
as far as you wish,

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
provided you have
the magic energy for it.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna try. Right now!

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
Please do.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center
Here goes.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Warp!

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
No way! I did it!

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
Yes, well done, indeed.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
You've successfully cast Warp.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
So, how does it feel?

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
It feels great!

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mister Sebas!

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] Since you've
got a knack for that,

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
let's practice
Dimension Home next.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Basically, Dimension
Home magic turned out

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
to be a step above Item Box.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
It creates a gigantic
space that can hold

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
much more stuff in comparison.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
Another way it's
superior to Item Box

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
is that there's air inside,
which means

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
it's capable of
containing living things.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
If I can tote my slimes
around in this thing,

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
mastering it would
be a huge help.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Dimension Home.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Did I do it right?

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
My congratulations.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Dimension Home
is now in your arsenal.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
Yes! Now I can carry my slimes!

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
You're living proof that
hard work pays off.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
And I'm happy it did.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
My word, look at the time.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
It should be getting dark soon.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
Let us reconvene
with the others.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
Already?

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] Time does seem to fly
when your concentration

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
is completely occupied.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
Shall we?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Warp, go.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
[MAYLENE]
No, Worgan and I are not dating!

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL]
It's so comfortable.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
I may never move from this spot!

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The next day,
we climbed in carriages

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
and went to pay
the abandoned mine

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
in North Gimul a visit.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
Our objective was
to train the lady in

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
monster combat skills.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
[REINHART] The duty of every
noble is to protect their land

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
and its citizens.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
Be it bandits or monsters,
it's our job to fight them

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
whenever they rear
their ugly heads.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
Does that include your daughter?

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
It's expected of anybody
who's born into the ducal line.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
Combat training is only
the beginning of it!

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
There's etiquette, economics.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
So many responsibilities
come along with

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
the title of being Duke.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
And she's learning it all?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Yes. Once we return
home from our trip,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
I'll be attending school
at the royal capital

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
to further my studies there.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
When that time comes,
I guess we'll have to part ways.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Dimension Home.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
All righty, you two kiddos.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
Yes, quite!

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do in there!

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
Good luck! Be careful!

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
We'll be awaiting
your safe return.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] While we were
busy training the lady,

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
Duke Reinhart and
his group went to

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
a different part of the mine
to investigate how bad

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
the monster infestation
in the shafts had become.

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Depending on how
severe their findings are,

00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
they may or may
not choose to issue

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
a quest at the
Adventurer's Guild.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL]
That's right.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
The duke and his father
are really strong.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
The madam is, as well.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
So they basically just
keep us guards around

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
as an extra line of defense.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
[JILL] If it's the kind of
monster that lives in a mine,

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
those three'll take it down
without breaking a sweat.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
Meaning if you were
worried about them,

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
you can stop.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
But if you have to worry,
worry about yourselves.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
[ZEPH] True.
Speaking of worrisome things...

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
Though it doesn't apply
here since these mines

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
were a place where
people worked,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
there're labyrinths
like this chock-full

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
of all sorts of traps.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
So the duke keeps scouts
such as myself around

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
to sniff out said traps.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
This should go without saying,

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
but try not to get
too far ahead of us.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
A praying mantis!

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
But it's huge.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
That's a cave mantis for ya.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
Talk about an enormous
pain in the you-know-what.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
It is? So it's dangerous?

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
But they breed quickly,
so if you come across one,

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
you can expect to see at
least 30 more, unfortunately.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
You're up! Time to shine!

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
Their arm attacks are
a bit on the fast side.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
Be wary of that.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Don't forget we're in a cave,
so no fire magic.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
The smoke has no place to go.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
I'll remember!

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
Go, Ice Arrow!

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Ice Arrow!

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
D'you see that?

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
Although you're activating
your magic fast enough.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
I want you to focus on
how accurate your aim

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
is for the next one.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Okay! I'll do my best.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
Way to knock 'em dead!

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
I was gonna say
it's Ryoma's turn.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
But, eh, now?
I'm not so sure.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
Is four too many for
a rookie to take?

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
I'll find out.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
I know you can do it!

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself, though.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
I won't.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
Physical Hardening.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
Takes more than tight spaces
to slow Ryoma down.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
M'lady.
These bug types are resilient.

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
Till you've managed
to destroy its head,

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
don't let your guard down.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Thus, we continued
our monster hunt through

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
the mineshaft with the lady
and I making quick work

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
of all the cave mantises
we encountered.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Nice. I think that'll do.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
Let's start heading back.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA gasps]

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!
A real live metal slime!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
There's actually metal slime?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
I'm going to catch it!

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
Ice Shield, go!

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
Ice Shield.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
There's nowhere left to run.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
That wasn't so hard.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
You're a pro now.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
Hurry and enter a
contract with it.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
I caught it for you! Take it.

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
It's a thank you for
teaching me how to play

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
with my magic.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
You're sure you don't want it?

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
Positive!

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
Thank you for this
thank you! Really!

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
What're you waiting for?

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Hurry and enter
a contract with it.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. Good idea.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
I see.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
So there was a nest of cave
mantises in your mineshaft.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] Just like there was
a nest of cave bats in ours!

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Which means
issuing a quest through

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
the Adventurer's Guild is
the best course of action

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
to take.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
I agree.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
You're a heavy one.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
I'd wager that's because
you probably eat metal.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
The red soil.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
I think the color's
due to oxidized iron.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
The iron ore may be depleted,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
but there might still
be some iron left.

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
Using alchemy, I separated
the iron from the soil.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
Isolate.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
I also took out the oxygen,
which was causing the rust.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
Combine! Consolidate!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
Not too bad!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL] Whoa, what kind
of magic was that?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
The splendid kind!

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
Is that the alchemy
you mentioned before?

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
I thought there might be iron.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
Since the metal slime would
have to eat some, right?

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES whistles]

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
That's the very first
non-fraudulent use

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
of alchemy I've ever seen.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
Ya learn something
new every day.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
Creative. That's our Ryoma.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
This iron.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed by how pretty it is.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
It's just like a mirror!

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] That reminds me.
I nearly forgot.

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
There's somebody
I've been meaning

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
to introduce you to, Ryoma.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The person he
wanted to introduce me to

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
was at a shop called
Morgan Trading Company,

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
so that's where we went next.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
Here it is.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
Hmm...

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
I see. Indeed.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
I never dreamed
I would encounter one.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
Never!

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
But a true alchemist
is right before my eyes!

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
Please, there's no
need for all that.

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
These items you've created...

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
I mean, who would've thought
to make waterproof cloth?

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
Sir Reinbach,
I know why you came here.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
And I'm honored to be the
merchant you thought of.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
Which is why I, Serge Morgan,

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
will take full responsibility
for selling these fine goods.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
If marketed correctly,

00:19:58.073 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
they should raise
substantial profits.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
'Scuse me.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
I'd rather people not
know that I'm the one

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
making these things.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
Oh? And why's that?

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
If word gets out
Ryoma's an alchemist,

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
some might suspect fraud.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
Alchemists aren't
exactly known for their

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
immaculate reputations.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
And there's also
his age to consider.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
If people were to
learn of his skills,

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
there are those who
would seek to kidnap him

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
and use him for their
own nefarious exploits.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
Also, I want to ensure Ryoma
receives all profits.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
What? That's a little too kind!

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
Without the inventor, the
products wouldn't exist.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
Do you follow me?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
It's natural you'd take it all.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
Don't be modest!
It's money that you've earned!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
And our family isn't
hurting for money

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
at the moment.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
I say it a lot, but I mean it!

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
Oh. And Serge is as
trustworthy as they come.

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
So your merchandise
will be in good hands.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Right.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
I guess I should thank you, too.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
It's my pleasure.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
Feel free to visit again.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
My door will always
be open for you!

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
So many wonderful people.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
They welcome me home.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
They worry about me.

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
And they honestly have my
best interest at heart.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
This must be what true
happiness feels like.

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
In conclusion,

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
after the ducal family completed
their investigation,

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
everyone that had any
involvement with embezzling

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
the funds for the pit
toilets was arrested.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
Meow wonderful!

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
Wow. Not bad for a duke.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
Point is, it's a done deal,
so stop worrying about it.

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
The thing I do want
you to worry about

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
is your next job.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
You're hunting monsters
in the abandoned mines.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
The mines, huh?

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
Like, the North Gimul Mines?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
Are there any tough
monsters in there?

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
The only strength they have
is their numbers.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
But we also don't know the
extent of what's down there,

00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
so work as a team
to get this done.

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow morning, we head out!

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
--Right!
--Myes!

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
--Sounds good.
--Really good.

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] And just like that,
I took on my second mission

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
with the Adventurer's Guild.

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.040 position:50% align:center
I don't want to be
a burden to the others,

00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna try and stay
as focused as possible!
