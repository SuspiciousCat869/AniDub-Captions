[RYOMA]
My name is Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
I'm your typical 11-year-old
living in the forest

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
where it's just me,
myself, and I,

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
day in and day out.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
Oh. But I guess I'm
not entirely alone.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
I also live with nearly
a thousand slimes!

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
Minor detail.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
Slimes evolve differently
depending on what you feed them.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
For instance, I fed green
caterpillars to some of them

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
and they turned into
sticky slimes.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
The sticky fluid they form
inside their bodies

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
can be used to make
a powerful thread

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
that comes in pretty handy
for hunting and stuff.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
Acid slimes, on the other hand,

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
have highly acidic bodily
fluids that are capable

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
of dissolving hard
things like bones.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
And these resilient little
guys made the mistake

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
of eating toxic weeds,
yet managed to survive,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
so now they're poison slimes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
Considering how much
faster they split

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:29.047 position:50% align:center
compared to other types,
their vitality's no joke.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
Cleaner slimes clean things
by eating dirt and grime.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
And get this, they even
eliminate smells!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
Scavenger slimes consume
excrement and garbage,

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.767 position:50% align:center
which sounds gross,
but they create fertilizer.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.413 position:50% align:center
I guess I do run into
goblins and thieves

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
from time to time
and have no choice

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.582 position:50% align:center
but to defend myself.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:10.213 position:50% align:center
For the most part, though,
every day is nice and peaceful.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Don't you die, Hughes!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
--[CAMIL] Hughes!
--[ZEPH] Please!

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.845 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I thought my simple
way of life with the slimes

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
in the forest would
last forever.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:21.641 position:50% align:center
But I suppose I should
expect the unexpected

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.934 position:50% align:center
from time to time.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
They don't look like bandits.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
But I have to wonder
what they're doing

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
this deep in the forest.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Is it bad?

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
It isn't good.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take magic to heal
him, and I don't have enough.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
Then we should hurry and get
him back to town.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
He won't last much longer.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Umm...

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
Um... I, uh, um uh...

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
Why's he here? He's just a kid.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I guess my voice is
rusty since I haven't had

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
to use it in years.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
Medicine. Me give you.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
Why am I talking like a caveman?

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Medicine?

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Right here. You take. Hurry.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Well?

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
Hughes is in luck!

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
I'm positive it's medicine.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
Is he...?

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL]
He just fell asleep.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
This ought to sustain
him for a while.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Thank you, boy.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
My home. Can rest. All of you.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
You're sure?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
What's a little kid like
him doing in a forest

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
all by himself?

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
We don't know if he's
alone just yet.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
I'd wager he's a hunter.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
Seems beast came this way.
So they'll come, too.

Enemy! They're not!

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you trying to tell
us that those slimes

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
are actually your servants?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
My apologies, then.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
None of us realized that
they were your familiars.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
I used to have slimes
for familiars.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
My very first ones.

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
That mean you tamer?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Former. But, yes.
Runs in my family.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
We've been tamers
for generations.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
But slimes weren't
my only familiars.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
We had red horses and
blizzard apes, primarily.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
So he's a noble.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
Maybe even an important one.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

[REINHART]
Huh. That's true.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center

live here alone.

Earlier, when he approached us.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
he masked his presence
remarkably well.

think he may not be

And I'm sorry for drawing

Caution is natural.
No apology.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
Thanks.
That's kind of you to say.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
So, uh... How did...

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Outside the forest,
we were struck by bandits.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
They hurt your friend?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
We took the bandits
out easily enough.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
But then a black bear
also came after us.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
Ah, gotcha.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
We managed to beat
the black bear, too.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
But not before
our horses ran away.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
We wanted to get Hughes
to town as fast as we could,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
so we took a shortcut
through the forest.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
Then we bumped into you.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center

Hm.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you a question,
too, Ryoma?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
Uh... O-Okay.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
You wield different magics.
And you create your own potions.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
Why live out here
with such talents?

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
Um... I, uh...

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
My grandparents
taught me those things.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
They were adventurers.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
And I take it they're
just out right now?

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
[GAIN] Yes, you will
be going to a new world,

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
but you won't be
starting from scratch.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
You'll be entering a body
I made just for the occasion.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[LULUTIA] You'll be around
eight years old, though,

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
so you could consider it
a type of reincarnation.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
[TAKEBAYASHI]
What? Eight?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
[GAIN]
As for your "special mission"...

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
You honestly won't have one.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
Okay then.

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
[KUFO] There are walls
separating your world from ours.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
When we finally send you
off on your merry way,

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
we'll be making a hole
in that world-dividing wall.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
And when that happens,
we'll be able to send

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
the magical power from
Earth right along with you.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Magical power?

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah, unfortunately,
our world is running

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
a little low on it these days.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
So you're in need of some
more of this power.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
Yes. The Earth happens to be
brimming with magic,

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.549 position:50% align:center
but nobody uses it.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
Wow. I never would
have guessed that.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
Will I...

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
Will I be able to use
magic when I arrive

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
at this new world?

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
--Oh, you bet!
--I'm surprised you have to ask!

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's so cool!

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's fine.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
I do believe we've
piqued his interest.

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
Well, shall we go ahead
and make it so you can

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
use all types of magic?

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'd stand
out too much.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
There's no denying it's
a rare trait to have.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
But it's not as big of a
deal as you might think.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
And besides, you'd be more
like a jack of all trades,

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
master of none.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] After that, they gave
me a lot of advice

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
and explanations.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
This was around the
time I concocted my

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
"dead grandparents told me
to find a new village" story.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
I had to be prepared.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
It's not like I could tell
people I came from Earth,

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
after all.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
Your new life is about to start!

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
I hope you've properly
braced yourself for this!

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't be so formal
and polite all of the time.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
This is your chance to live
the life you've always wanted.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
Um, I'll try.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Thanks for looking out.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Uh! I mean... Whatever.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
We'll always be
watching over you,

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
no matter where you go!

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
The church should
be your first stop

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
as soon as you make
it to the town.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
You'll have an oracle skill,
so you can use it

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
whenever you need
to communicate with us.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
I'll put it at the top
of my to-do list

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
when I get to town.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
Guess this is goodbye
for now, though.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Have a wonderful and
exhilarating time, darling!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful for this
gift you've given!

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
Well then, shall we?

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
With our powers combined,
we open for you

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
the gate to a new world!

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[LULUTIA] May you be swathed in
nothing but our blessings!

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
[KUFO] And may light shine
on the journey ahead!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Before I knew it, I was off.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
I was reborn in a new world,
just like they said.

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
In an eight-year-old body.

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
I found myself in a place
I'd come to know as Seilfall.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
I really am a little kid.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
I've made it to another world.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
The gods were gracious enough
to prepare a manual

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
that would help me
weather the hardships

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
my new life might throw at me.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
Check the last page
of this book.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
You'll find your
starting status.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
I suddenly feel like a
character in a video game!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
All of my stats involve
brute strength somehow.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
Ah. It's fine.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
I guess they integrated my
skills from my last life

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
into this one.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Okay, so I'm definitely strong,
but I'm in a kid's body.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to get
used to that.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
A slime!

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
Let's see if it knows
any tricks!

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
Shake, boy.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
Oh! Magic! Duh!

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
How to use your magic.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
To make a monster obey
your every command,

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
you need taming magic.

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay! Let's see.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
Calm your heart and feel
the magic flowing

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
from the soles of your feet
to the top of your head.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
Feel it.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
This is my magic!

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
Once you feel it
coursing through you,

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
envision that same energy
flowing out of your body.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
I decided to make
the Forest of Gana

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
my new home in this world.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
Because of how much I worked,

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
it was next to impossible
for me to devote

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
any time to hobbies.

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
I think that's what led me
to researching slimes.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
It took me three years,

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
but the first people
I came into contact with

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
in Seilfall were Reinhart
and his companions.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
Two whole weeks have passed
since my unexpected

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
encounter with those guys.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
If these numbers are right,
then there's 364 sticky slimes.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
Whoa. They multiply faster
than rabbits do!

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
Once Reinhart and
his friends left,

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
it was back to my
everyday routine.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
The sun feels great.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's wrong?

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
Ryoma! We're back!

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[CAMIL]
You been holding up okay?

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:09.412 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Ever since I came to Seilfall,

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:12.707 position:50% align:center
the only things my new life
consisted of were slimes.

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
But my small, slimy world was
about to get much bigger.
