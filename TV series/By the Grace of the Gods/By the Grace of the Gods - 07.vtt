00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.967 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.343 position:50% align:center
Why choose to leave?

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
Although I appreciate
everything you've done,

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer if I didn't
mooch off you.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
But you're not!

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
There're so many things.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
The baptism.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
Registering at the guild.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
You all got me where I am today.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
It's been great.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
Too great.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
I feel like your hospitality
is spoiling me.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
So now, it's time for me
to take a step back.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
What in the world
are you boys doing?

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.356 position:50% align:center
I understand,
but just so we're clear.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
This separation isn't going
to last forever, right?

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
Now don't get the wrong idea!

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.196 position:50% align:center
I love your family way too
much to make this permanent!

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
I just want to retrain myself.
Rely on my own capabilities.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
[ELISE]
Well then.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
When you're ready to come back,
know you'll be welcome.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
But Mother!

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
You don't care if he leaves?

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
You'll be leaving us as well
when you go to school.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
Ryoma just wants to spread
his wings a little bit.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
Although, he's still so
young to fly the nest.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
Eleven-year-olds are
allowed to be dependent.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
Especially for somebody
like Ryoma.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center
He deserves to be spoiled!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Don't be like that, Elise.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50% align:center
We had a feeling that
this day was coming.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
I know we did.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
What feeling?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
So you knew?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] I wouldn't say
"knew," but we did anticipate

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
you'd have a desire to live
by yourself eventually.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Really?

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
You're a talented child, and
we've seen others just like you.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS] We knew you were
wise beyond your years

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
when you registered in
search of work as soon as

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
you arrived in
an unfamiliar town,

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
not to mention how diligent
you were in doing so.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
You did this as if it
were completely natural.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
Which is exactly why your
request to venture out

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
on your own is something
we all have been expecting.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
Everyone but me.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
I never even dreamed
this might happen.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
However.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
I don't think we realized just
how soon you'd leave us.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
We won't try and persuade
you to stay here.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
We just hope we can
persuade you to take it easy.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
Oftentimes, excess effort
leads to waste, not results.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Right.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
You may go now.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
But, before that
actually happens,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
we would like to set
a few conditions.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
The first being you have
to update us with a letter

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
on a regular basis!

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Will do.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
The second condition is,
every once in a while,

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
you have to pay us a visit.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
Thirdly... Don't hesitate
to ask us for help

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
should the need ever arise!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
This one's the most vital, okay?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll remember.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Ryoma.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
I'm truly sad to see you go.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
And I respect and understand
why you're choosing

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
to leave us.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
But still!

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
I must insist that you agree
to one additional condition

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
before you go!

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
Promise we'll meet again
in three years' time!

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Then, once again in six years!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
In six years,
I'll graduate from school.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
But the three-year mark
is important, too.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
Students get a
long vacation then,

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
so it'd be the perfect
time to meet up!

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
I know it's a fairly long
ways off from now.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
I'll concentrate on my studies
in the meantime, though.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
And maybe I'll even get
a little bit better

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
with my magic!

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you will.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact...

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna try and get
better myself, just like you.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
So we're in agreement, then!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
If you forget for some
reason or another,

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
I will be very angry with you!

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
Um... I'll do my best to make
sure that doesn't happen.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
How hard is it to say you
promise you won't forget?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] Oh! And before I forget,
there is one last thing!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
What haven't we covered?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] For the remainder
of our stay in Gimul,

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
you'll reside in this
inn with us.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
But... I can't... I feel like...

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
This isn't your
decision to make.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] If I stay here,
I'll still be relying on you.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
I beg to differ.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
Yes! I think you'll be fine!

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
I don't see a problem.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
Neither do I.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
Try looking again!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.266 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
But I...

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
It's our final condition,
so you have to agree to it.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
Right. I guess I'm
staying here, then.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
Great! What delightful news!

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
You can say that again!

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
While we're on the topic,

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
how long will you be
in Gimul, anyway?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
I suppose it must've
slipped our minds.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
We intend to stay
in town until the time

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
of the grell frog outbreak!

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
Frog outbreak?
Hold on just a second.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
Grell frogs are the ones
whose hides are used

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
in making armor, right?

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
And in addition to that,
their organs are used

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
to make top-notch medicine.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
Every year, without fail,
they show up in droves

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
at a lake not too far from here.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
So you want to fight them
for combat training?

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH]
Not combat training.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Our real targets are
actually the limour birds

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
that arrive at the same
time as the frogs.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
We still call it the grell
frog outbreak, though.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
What is a limour bird?

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
This.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
Its feathers sure are beautiful.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] And their songs
are equally beautiful.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
Their speed is another trait
that makes people want them.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
The thing is, they're
very tricky to catch,

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
so not many tamers have
had much luck with that.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
They're a rarity,
to say the least.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
Not during the outbreak, though!

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
They almost cover
the whole lake!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
Sounds like something to see!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] You'll be able to if you
accompany us when we go.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
[SEBAS]
Yes.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be a good
opportunity for you,

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
Mister Ryoma.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
You don't have to twist
my arm for this.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
We are going to have
so much fun! You'll see!

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I bet. Can't wait.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
So tell me, Ryoma.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
Since you're not depending
on us anymore,

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
what are you planning to do?

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
First off.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
I'd like to live in Gimul
as an adventurer for a while.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
I'll establish connections
and continue to train

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
in the process.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
And I might even
start my own business.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
What kind?

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Well... I was thinking
of starting a laundry service.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
With the help of the
cleaner slimes, that is.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
If I say I can clean stains
as tough as goblin grime

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
in my advertisements,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50% align:center
I think I can make enough money
to pay for necessities, so...

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
[ARAUNE, LILIAN]
You surely will.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[REINBACH] Have you been
eavesdropping this whole time?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
I know what this looks like,
but not all of us

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
are to blame.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
It was Camil's idea.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't try and pin
this entire thing on me!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
[ARAUNE] I'm confident your
laundry service will be

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
a fruitful endeavor.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Well, that's encouraging.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
[LILIAN] If you only knew
the amazing amount of stuff

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
that gets tossed by adventurers
because the icky grime

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
or awful smell won't come out,

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
you'd understand what a godsend
your business will be!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
Much cheaper to clean
than buy new gear.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
You'd save them a fortune
while making your own.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Yes, I agree, wholeheartedly.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
That's very interesting.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
Ryoma.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
You should discuss
this with Serge

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
at the Morgan Trading Company.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
He'll make sure you
start on the right foot.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Well, then.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
Since you'll be looking
for work anyway,

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
would you mind taking
on a job for us?

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
Sure. What kind?

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
The kind that would have
you managing the mines

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
with the time you have
in between managing

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
your new business and your
Adventurer Guild missions.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
You'd only have to
check it periodically.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
So it doesn't turn
into a monsters' den.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.
That won't be any trouble.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
It won't be trouble for me,
but somehow I'm still

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
troubling them and
getting their help despite

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
being independent.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
I know I'm always telling
you this, but thank you!

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
I should be happy that
these people care about me

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
as much as they do.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
A very good thing.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] The next day,
the lady and I went to Morgan

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
Trading Company to discuss
my business venture

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
with Mister Serge.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
Magnificent!

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
Goblin grime completely
vanished in a matter

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
of mere seconds!

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
Cleaner slimes.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Who knew such a
creature existed?

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
Yet another splendid idea
from that wonderfully

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
brilliant mind of yours!

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
I'm not that brilliant.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
Don't be so modest,
Mister Ryoma.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
This is one compliment
you truly deserve.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
Indeed!

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
I can practically see the piles
of money you'll be raking in!

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
Mister Serge?

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking how
smart it would be if you

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
went ahead and registered
with the Merchant's Guild.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
The Merchant's Guild?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
I know your business
is up-and-coming

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.096 position:50% align:center
and they don't endorse
establishments that can barely

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
make ends meet, but there's
not a doubt in my mind

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
that your cleaning service
will have the slightest

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
bit of trouble achieving
a decent profit!

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
You really think it'd
make a decent profit?

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
Way more than decent,
I guarantee it!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
[SERGE] I suggest you
register as soon as possible!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
Just so that they don't
cause trouble for you

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
further on down the road.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
There's no time like
the present, as they say,

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
so why don't we go
and do it now?

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
Sure!
You don't mind coming, too?

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
Although I'm older,
I can still get out and about.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
I simply cannot get over
how amazing this laundry

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
service idea is!

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
So much money!

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
Just wait.
You'll see for yourself.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
And whatever you need,

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
I, Serge Morgan,
will be there to assist you

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
in any way that I can!

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] A little dramatic, but
it's still nice of him to offer.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
Um, thanks, Mister Serge.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
That's a comforting thought.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
[ARAUNE]
We need to make money, too!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
[LILIAN]
We could be maid idols.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
[ARAUNE]
Ooh!

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
[SERGE]
What is it?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
Strange.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
My name's Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
And I've come here
in hopes of registering

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
with the Merchant's Guild.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
Whatever guidance you have,

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
I will gladly receive
it all with open ears

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
and an open mind.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
And you all may
call me Glissela.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
In case you didn't
connect the dots,

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
I'm the guild master
for the Gimul branch.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
So, you'd like to open
a laundry service, eh?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
And you expect to pull
in so much money

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
that you'd get in trouble
if you didn't register now?

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Yes, well...
Better safe than sorry.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA laughs]

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
I have to admit I like
the way your mind works,

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
Ryoma!
And this slime you have.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
It's so rare that its
breed is unknown?

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
This is good, yes!
It's very good!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
She seems to like it
as much as we do.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
She does. What a relief.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA]
"Like" is an understatement.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
I love it so much I wanna
get you registered

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
as soon as we can!

00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Let's also determine the
store's physical location.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
[GLISSELA] Just waltz in here
and work an old lady ragged,

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
why don't you?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
Not that I mind it.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
Ah, this should be the
perfect place, I think.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
Bet you'll agree
once you see it.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
It's a bit of a fixer-upper.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
But that just means it's cheap.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Whoa.
I didn't think it'd be so big.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
This building used to
serve as an inn, a bar,

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
and a warehouse, but that
was well before the fire.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
It's been abandoned for
quite some time now.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] It's in a residential
area that's close to the

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
Adventurer's Guild.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
It's also just a hop,
skip, and a jump from

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
the industrial district.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
This place really
is perfect for me.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
So you're thinking
of getting it?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
Hard not to.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
It's a great location.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
I should be set for success
once I clean it up

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
and build the actual shop.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
All right. I'll make it work!

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Mister Serge?
Consider this place sold.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure all
the paperwork for this

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
gets taken care of.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
You'd really do that?

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Of course. Why wouldn't I when
you're paying me a nice

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
commission fee?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
And since you're
obviously new to this,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
I'd like to loan you some
of my employees

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
to help you get started.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
What's with the face?

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
They're professional
supervisors, so they'll handle

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
management for you.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.384 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
But...

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
Mister Ryoma.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
Delegating the day-to-day
management duties

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
is simply standard procedure.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Kinda like how
the manager of a restaurant

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
franchise is a hired
employee, not the owner.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
Restaurant franchise?

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Please forget I said that!

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
If your intention was
to manage everything,

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
I would have to
advise against it,

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
since I don't believe you're
suited for such a role.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
I can clearly read
your emotions

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
as if you were an open book.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
Is that seriously how
transparent I am?

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
[SERGE] Given your age, I
suppose you mask your feelings

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
better than your peers.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
But you're going to be dealing
with crafty merchants

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
who will try to take
advantage of you.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Didn't think of that.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
Too bad the poker face
I had in my previous life

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
didn't carry over.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
I'll use your guys instead.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
One more thing.

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
I'd like to buy
supplies from you.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
Considering the mess this
place is in, I'll need a lot!

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
Ah, but of course.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
Together, let's turn this trash
heap into a treasure trove!

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
It's a deal!

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, we got off
to a very smooth start.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
What began as a dream
was turning into a reality

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
faster than I ever
thought it could.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
First thing I did was have
the scavenger slimes

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
eat the overgrown weeds.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the acid slimes ate
away at the abandoned building.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
I planned for the shop
to be two stories high

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
with a basement level below.

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
One other thing I
included was a dormitory

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
for the employees to live in.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
Create Block, go!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
Now! Pavement!

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
That covers all of
the foundation work.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you lending a hand.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
Don't mention it.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
Especially if you're gonna
mention something

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
along the lines of, "Oh, no!

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
I'm relying on these
people yet again!"

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
Helping friends
is second nature.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
And we are your friends, right?

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Correct answer's yes.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
So don't think you're
overly relying on us.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
You're our friend,
and we wanted to help.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
All there is to it.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
That really means a lot, guys.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
It really shouldn't, though,
because it's natural,

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
just like I said.

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Oh.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES laughs]
Lighten up.

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
[WELANNA]
Hand me the apron, Cilia!

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
[CILIA]
Right!

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
[MIZELIA] A white paint job's
gonna look pretty bland.

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
White means clean,
and cleanliness is key

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
for the outside of
a laundry service!

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
Colors are nice,
but white looks clean,

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
and that's what I want.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
Yep, yep!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
The stuff inside is
gonna be just as clean

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
as the stuff outside!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
Ryoma. I heard you got
bumped to rank E

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
for that monster hunt
we did up in the mines.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yeah, thanks to all of you.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] You were purr-haps
the most useful person

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
on the entire team!

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
But this laundry thing.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take you places,
just wait 'n' see!

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
You know...
This is also thanks to you.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Meow?

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
[JEFF] I'm gonna be first in
line as soon as this place

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
opens. I have a mountain
of laundry at home.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
But you're just as
bad, right, Leipin?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
[LEIPIN]
Yes.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
Once people learn what
Ryoma's cleaner slimes can do,

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
that line just might be
wrapped around the block.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
I'm 100% positive
business will be booming!

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
That'd be nice if you're right.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
You'll do just fine.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
You've already got seven
guaranteed repeat customers

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
right here!

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Thanks in advance, then!

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
I also heard you're
mainly doing this because

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
you wanna be able
to support yourself.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Bold move turning down
the duke's family.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
You're crazy!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
I'd love it if someone
fed me with a silver spoon.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
You must admit his way
of thinking is impressive.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
I do. And I respect it.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
[CILIA]
Listen, everybody.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
The building isn't
going to paint itself,

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
so less talking more
working, please.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
Well said, Cilia! Hup!

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES]
"Bamboo Forest Laundry Service?"

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
So, uh... What does that mean?

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
My last name is Takebayashi--
that's what it's based on.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
In the town I grew up in,
"Take" means bamboo,

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
and "Bayashi" means forest.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
[HUGHES] Oh.
That makes a little more sense.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm still confused,
but it sounds good, at least.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
Just a thought.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
But I think the outside
looks a little bit too dull.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
Does it?

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
It's fixable!

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
A few flowers here and
there would do wonders!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
You know what? Great idea!

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
I've walked on grass
plenty of times,

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
but never planted it.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're
not even a little tired.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
You've been working
around the clock.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
This is nothing.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Compared to the
last place I worked,

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
I may as well be on vacation.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
So then, did you feel overworked
at this previous job?

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Yes. Sometimes.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
But seeing the finished
products gave me

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
a small sense of accomplishment.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
The compliments clients
gave me were another

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
gratifying aspect.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
So what kind of work
were you doing to receive

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
all of these lovely
client compliments?

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
Um... I was, uh...

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
I can't exactly tell her
I was a system engineer

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
or programmer.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:41.746 position:50% align:center
A couple things.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
I had to carry stuff
for one job.

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
And another required me
to make a type of doll.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
You made dolls?

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
Yes, and I still can, so I could
make one for you, too.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
I would love that!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
If you have the time
to do it, of course!

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
The ones I worked on were
designed with boys in mind,

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
not girls.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
It'd be kinda inappropriate.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
I, um, forgot something.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
You'll remember it eventually!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
Just don't get your
hopes up about the doll.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
[ELIARIA]
A grand opening party?

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Well, since the
shop is almost complete,

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
I thought it might be nice
to invite everybody

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
who had a hand in working
on it to come check it out

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
before the official opening.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
I'll have food and drink
for people to partake in

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
and we'll celebrate a little.

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
I'm all for a celebration!

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it,
since it's also a "thank you"

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
to my friends that helped me.

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm fine.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of stopping
by that church, though.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
You go and I'll walk
the lady home.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
I'll see you later,
Mister Ryoma.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
[KUFO]
Been a long time, Ryoma.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
Well, a long time by your
standards, not mine.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Kufo!

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
Where are Gain and Lulutia?

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
I guess they had other plans.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's right.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
They're both currently visiting
the world you're from.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
They're on Earth?

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.180 position:50% align:center
Is it for a transfer?

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
[KUFO]
Oh, no! No, nothing like that.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
They're just, uh... Sightseeing.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Lulutia's eating her heart out.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to try first!

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
[KUFO] And Gain fell head over
heels for a J-pop girl group.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
Go! I love you!

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
Okay. Sure.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
Seilfall isn't exactly renowned
for its entertainment, right?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
I actually went
to Earth, too!

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
I was feeling adventurous
the other day

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
and decided to have some fun.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
I saw the Amazon.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
The Sahara Desert.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
The deep seas.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
Even Atlantis!

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
It was unbelievably awesome!

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn you said
Atlantis, but it's not real.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
[KUFO laughs]

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
Time's up? So soon?

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
That was quick,
like really quick!

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it's 'cause Gain
and Lulutia aren't here.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Before you go, listen up.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
You should know your
mind is being affected

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
by your younger body.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
You're going through
infantile regression.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
Training and keeping yourself
in tip-top shape is good,

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
but don't overdo it, okay?

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
Hey. Wait!

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
So my kid body is somehow
having an effect on my mind?

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
Infantile regression?

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center
I can clearly read
your emotions,

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
as if you were an open book.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
It kind of makes sense, though.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
I'm experiencing more
emotions than I ever felt

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
during my time on Earth.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
And it explains why
I can't pull off a decent

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
poker face anymore.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] Thanks for your
divine advice, Kufo.

00:21:58.193 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
I'll be back.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
It's already this late?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
I should get home before
the lady starts to worry.

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
Come on, feet!

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
My days were getting busier,
but they were also

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
getting more rewarding.

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
And with the laundry business
grand opening fast approaching,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
that wouldn't be
changing anytime soon.
