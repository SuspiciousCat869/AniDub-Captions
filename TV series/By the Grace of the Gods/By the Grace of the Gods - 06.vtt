00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Very good.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
Question...

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
What do you intend to do
with those samples?

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
An experiment!

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
The metal slime's super hard.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
So it should hold up
against physical attacks

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
fairly well.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
What I don't know is
how much other things

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
affect it, so I'm gonna
try and find out!

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
Interesting!

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
Of course,

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
I don't really want
it to injure itself.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
The point is to observe
the slime's reactions.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
We'll start with the
poison slime sample.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Doesn't seem to have a problem.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center
Let's see if sticky slime
solution affects it.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
That's two for two.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
Then, how 'bout the acid kind?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
Safe to say it doesn't
care for that one.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:10.236 position:50% align:center
Since acid's known to melt
metal, that doesn't surprise me.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.239 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I think that's enough
experiments for one day.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I scared you.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.912 position:50% align:center
Hmm? Whoa. [laughs]

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
You can mold it like clay!

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
I guess I can!

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
Oh, Ryo-mya!

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
Yoo-hoo!

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.765 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Ryoma!

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
If you're ready to go,
then let's hit it!

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.646 position:50% align:center
Coming!

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.065 position:50% align:center
Be down in a jiffy!

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50% align:center
Thanks for making this faster.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
You don't have to thank me.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
Just slay the monsters
and come back!

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
I'll try.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
I mean, I will!

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
Good luck on your hunt.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
And above all else, be careful!

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN] The good news is,
we know what we're up against

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
in these mineshafts.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
Cave mantises.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
This here is a cave mantis.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Along with cave bats.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
They're essentially
rats with wings.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, there're small
rats as well.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
You see how horrifying they are?

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
All three of these are weak
enough on their own.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
Problem is, we're expecting
to encounter a large horde.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
Bottom line--

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
Don't get too cocky and
let your guard down.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
[JEFF] Nice!
So you were promoted to rank F?

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
I was.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
It happened after that last job.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
Never thought cleaning
toilets would earn me

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
a promotion.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Hard work is what earned
you that promotion.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
It's true, but why
are you saying it

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
with that face?

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
Anyway, if you do
as well on this hunt

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
as you did in those pits,

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll
go up another rank!

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
Ryo-mya always does his best!

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
Seems we have to split up.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Our group will continue down
the right-hand path.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
You better watch your backs.
Okay? Both of you.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
Please save your concern.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
I don't know the meaning
of the word negligence.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
May there be enough
to go around.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I sure hope so.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50% align:center
Just out of curiosity...

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
How many slimes do you have now?

00:04:56.296 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
Let's see, for sticky slimes,
I have 728 of those.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
Then I have 323 poison slimes.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
And 211 acid slimes,
last I checked.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
There's 3,033
scavenger slimes now.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
Eleven cleaner slimes.
Two healing slimes.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
One metal slime,
and, last but not least,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
one ordinary slime.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
Which makes 4,310.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
That is quite a number.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
An outrageous number.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how much they
grew in the very beginning.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
You must be a very talented
tamer to control so many!

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
As talented a tamer
as they come!

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
Okay, why do you
keep looking at him

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
like he's made of catnip?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
[WELANNA chuckles]

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
Could you tell me
something else?

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
Of course.
What is it you wanna know?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
Weapons.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
What kind are you
proficient at utilizing?

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
My weapon of choice
is a bow and arrow.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
I can also use daggers
or fight unarmed.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
And I can use attack magic.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
Then do you mind concentrating
on the flying monsters

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
when we come across them?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
Attack spells
would definitely help.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
And no one else here uses them.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to me.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
I actually have a few attack
spells at my disposal.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
But, beastkin magic
energy tends to be on

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
the low side.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
I may not be able to
use any attack spells.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
But I'll provide you with
healing magic whenever

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
you may need it!

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
All right! Here they come!

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
We've got monsters to hunt down!

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[JEFF]
No challenge at all.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a cave full
of rats and mantises.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
Only a novice would have
a hard time fighting

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
them off.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
The types of monsters
Jeff finds challenging

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
are trouble.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
It'd be a cat-tastrophe
if any of those uglies

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
came our way.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
Come on. We can walk
and talk at the same time.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
So let's get moving.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Fair enough.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
[chittering]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
There's a throng of cave
bats straight ahead.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
Every last bit of
the ceiling is covered.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
So you can detect them, too?

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
Well, I lived in a forest
for three years.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
So I'm fairly attuned
to these things.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
Man. Cave bats always
come in big groups, huh?

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
That's what makes them a pain.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
I wish we could take
'em all out at once.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
Wouldja care if I conduct
a quick experiment?

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
I'm dead serious.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
And if this works, I might be
able to grant your wish!

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Meow so?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
With magic, of course!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
A type called "Sound Bomb."

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Sound Bomb magic, you say?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
That's not a type
I'm familiar with.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us what it's like?

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
It's easier to show
than explain.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
First thing, though,
is putting up something

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
to shield you from harm.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
Soundproof Barrier.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
Me-wow!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
Something to shield us
from harm, huh?

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
Just what is he planning?

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Okay.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
Sound Bomb attack, go!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Nice. Coast is clear!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
[MIYA gasps]

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
That's what I call a success!

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
I'd say so.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
So you knocked them out
with a huge blast of sound.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
It's named appropriately,
that's for sure.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
[WELANNA]
Impressive.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
That's because
Ryo-mya's the best!

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[JEFF]
Again? Ugh. Never mind.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Your turn, big sticky slimes!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
Now... Maximize!

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
Whoa! They're huge!

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
I doubt we would've
won if it wasn't for you

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
and your slimy little pals!

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Yeah, your healing
slimes helped my brother

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
fully recover! Thank you!

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's wonderful.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
Would you look at that.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
He might seem like
a polite little boy.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
But he's a full-fledged
adventurer, through 'n' through.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA laughs]

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Great work today, everybody!

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
I know the goblin village
wasn't anticipated.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
And the goblin commander
was even more unexpected.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
Therefore, you're all
getting a raise for this job!

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURERS cheering]

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[WORGAN]
Now go home and get some rest.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
You deserve it!

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
[LEIPIN]
About your healing slimes.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
Just wondering, but do they
have the same kind of appetite

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
as the others?

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
They only drink water, so no.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
Their diet consists of water?

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
But how do they survive
if that's all they consume?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
Photosynthesis.
Just like plants do.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
They make their own
nutrients by absorbing

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
the sun's light.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
Slimes that live the
same way as plants.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
I didn't know monsters
could do that.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
How furr-ocious are
your healing slimes?

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
They're actually really weak.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.975 position:50% align:center
Doubt they could even
beat a normal slime

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
in a fight.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.853 position:50% align:center
That's quite weak, all right.

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
I think that's why people
don't come across

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
healing slimes very often.

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
Even if they somehow
manage to appear,

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
their odds of
surviving are slim.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
Makes sense to me!

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI] Although, I may not be
well-versed in taming magic.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
I've heard that the more
monsters you possess,

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
the more difficult it is
to keep them under control.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
You have come to
command an astounding

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
number of slimes, Ryoma.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
Does that not raise
your evaluation

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
at the Tamer's Guild?

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I only just
registered with them, so,

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
I have no achievements
on record.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
Plus, they don't
care for slimes.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
Since tamers are judged
by their monsters' strength.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
I don't find that the
least bit surprising.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
There are many who
deem slimes worthless.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
It's a terrible misconception--
an utter shame.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
That's crazy.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
I don't know much about tamers,

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
but I do know Ryoma and
his slimes are awesome

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
in every way!

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, well.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
If only people weren't
blinded by the biases

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
they have, they'd see what you
see and Ryoma would get

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
the praise he deserves.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Need a break?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
I could take the reins
for a little bit if you do.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
If anyone needs a break,
I would definitely

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
say it's you.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
I know you're tough,
but aren't you tired?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
Kinda.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
Fighting off goblins really
takes it out of you, huh?

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Especially when it's unexpected.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
We're normally much more
prepared for jobs like that.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Today was what
you'd call a fluke.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
A fluke? Yeah, guess so.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
We still have a fair
ways to go, you know.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try
and get some sleep?

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
You drive a hard bargain,
but okay.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA] I'm so glad
I came to this world.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
No matter who I meet,
they're always nice to me.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
It's the complete opposite
of how it was on Earth.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
But...

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
I'm still the same ol' me.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
I haven't changed at all.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
I was sick and tired
of having to deal

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
with people on Earth.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
So I hid away in the forest.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't met
the Jamil family,

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
I might never have left.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
Heck, I'd still be there today!

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
They allowed me
to travel with them.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
Gave me shelter
and plenty of food.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
If I needed it, they provided.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
It was kind of dream come true.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
But...

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Am I relying on them too much?

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
Is it right for me to keep
depending on the ducal family

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
like I have been?

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure it is.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
Ryo-mya! Bye for meow!

00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
Good night!

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the lift!
And the nap!

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] You'd make a
fortune doing laundry!

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
I'm fuurrr real!

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
She really thinks I could?

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
You took on 2,000 goblins?

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
And you're sure you're not hurt?

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
I promise you I'm fine.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
Just like everybody else is.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
We beat them without
a single casualty.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
That's fantastic news!

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
What's even more
fantastic news is that I think

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
we wiped out most
of the monsters.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
Your diligence has
paid off once again!

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
[RYOMA]
Also...

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
There's, uh, one more thing
that we need to discuss.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
Mister Ryoma. What's wrong?

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
[REINHART]
Elia.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's talk.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
It's about a decision
I made recently.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center
You've all helped me so much,
and I'm grateful for it.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
Truly and deeply grateful.

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
However.

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:13.792 position:50% align:center
From now on,
I wanna try and support myself.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
I need to separate from you.
