I will have my vengeance!

[KATAKURA] Lord Masamune,
this is Lake Biwa.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,041
Which means Osaka, the Toyotomi
stronghold, is just ahead.

10
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,916

[KATAKURA] Always!

00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,541
[CHOSOKABE] Sorry for
ending up on that detour.

[SARUTOBI grunts] It looks
like the other side is headed

44
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,625
for the Kyoto-Osaka region, too.

00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,333
Well, their goal isn't apparent.

48
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,875
But the thing is, the
Saika clan's movement

49
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,750
concerns me as well.

50

You shouldn't be
pushin' yourself!

00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,166
Keiji, it is fine.

56
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,458
And besides, you have
a question for me,

57
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,875
do you not, Lady Magoichi?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,166
It concerns what that man said.

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,750
[TENKAI] Lord Nobunaga's
body and soul will converge.

Ah... He shall live again!

61
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,333
[MATSU]
He is serious.

62
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,041
He is likely trying to use
Lady O-Ichi as a medium

63
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,833
and to call forth Oda Nobunaga,

64
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,500

Heaven into this world.

00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,666
[gasps] What's wrong, Magoichi?

70
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,291
Gettin' all worked up.
This isn't like you.

71
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,458
Long ago,

72
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,916
we of the Saika Faction
and Oda Nobunaga,

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
the King Devil, met in battle.

74
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,500
[SAIKA]
It was bitterly fierce.

75
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,458
The previous Saika
Magoichi was killed.

76
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,125
[SAIKA] The home of the
Saika was reduced to ashes.

77
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,750
And many were killed.

78
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,500
Never again will I allow
him to defile another,

no matter who it is!

80
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,291
[SAIKA] That is why I'm
the successor to my name.

81
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,666
Lady Magoichi, I, too,
shall accompany you.

82
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,708
[KEIJI]
Wha...?

83
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,500
It is my responsibility
as someone

84
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,541
who once sided with the Oda.

85
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,541
[DATE] Here we've come all this
way to check out the enemy camp,

86
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,166
and they don't even
have dumplings?

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,708
Talk about bein' hard up.

88
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,291
[KATAKURA]
It seems their food was taken

89
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,208
in preparation for war. I hear
that what little rice they have

90
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,166
has also doubled in price.

you were the ones
who bumped into us!

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,333
So, what?

00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
You Shimazu troops
aren't even from here!

100
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,916
Yeah?! So?!

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,250
We answer the call to
bring down the Tokugawa,

102
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,791
but, we do not bow
to the Toyotomi!

103
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,750
You got a problem
with the Toyotomi?

under the same banner.

110

If you have an
objection with that,

111
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,708
bring the matter to
Master Ishida's attention!

and allow you to leave!

down right here, then?

I got no problem with that.

131

Probably end up draggin' in
a bunch of others, though.

[growls] Involving
the townspeople

133
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,375
would be unacceptable.

134
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,541
Okay, then!

135
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,250
So take a nice little
tea break with me.

136
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,916
[DATE] By the way,
you told them earlier

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
they should take any
grievances to Ishida.

138
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,541
From your point of view,
what kinda man is he?

139
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,041
Master Ishida is a man
who approaches all matters

140
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,541
rigorously, and holds to a
standard of integrity for all.

That's why you allied with him?

[SANADA]
We are the same.

143
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,500
The same how?

144
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,666
Master Ishida, bereft of
his liege, is the same as I,

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,166
when I became lost
when my lord collapsed.

146

Are you sayin' he's
also feelin' lost?

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,166
I do not know.

148
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
However, it is my desire

to be there for Master
Ishida during this time.

150

That is so like you.

151
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,416
By that same token, why have
you thrown your support

00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,958
He looks up to my
lord as his mentor

162
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
and we are both living
in the same era.

163
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
But despite all of that,

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,541
the difference between myself
and Lord Tokugawa is great.

165
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,333
[DATE]
Yeah.

166
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,375
[gasps]

167
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,833
That's why I'm
gonna destroy 'im!

168
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,916
[SANADA]
Uh!

169
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,916
[DATE] Good talk.
This one'll be my treat.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,833
[SANADA gasps]

171
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,916
But our next party, you'll pay.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,458
Be seein' ya, Sanada Yukimura.

173
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,166
I could not have asked for more!

174
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,541
[KATAKURA]
It would seem those to the west

175
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,250
are not fully unified.

176
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,291
[DATE]
Guess not.

177
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,291
But none o' that
crap even matters.

178
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,750
I'll fight who I wanna fight and
destroy who I wanna destroy!

179
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
Not sure how I feel about it,

180
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
but he's back to his old self.

181
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
Yes, the man I once knew.

182
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,875
The man known as Date Masamune.

183
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,000
The man I'm proud
to call my rival!

184
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,625
[ISHIDA]
What? He betrayed us?

185
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,833
[SANADA] The Venerable Tenkai
cut down those of the Oda

186
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,208
he had brought with him and even
tried to slay his own ninja.

187
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,875
Circumstances were such
that I intervened.

188
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,458
Gyobu, what is all this about?

189
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,375
[OTANI] Apparently, he
was plotting something

190
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,291
without my knowledge.

191
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,500
[ISHIDA growls]
Tenkai.

192
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,541
[OTANI] So, what has become
of the Lady O-Ichi?

193
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,375
[SANADA]
Her whereabouts are unknown.

194
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,333
She has been reduced
to an eerie darkness

195
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,500
that is no longer human.

196
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
Gyobu!

197
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,666
You allowed such rabble
to join the Toyotomi?

198
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,916
[OTANI]
Mm...

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,458
[SANADA]
Please, do not do this!

200
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,708
[ISHIDA growls]

201
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,000
Master Ishida, you are
the supreme commander.

202
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,791
If you are not prepared
to take responsibility,

203
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,916
you will have no chance
of winning this war.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,583
[ISHIDA growls]
You insolent...!

205
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,541
[ISHIDA growls]

206
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,583
So, what're we gonna
do, Commander?

207
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,958
We're about to have a showdown,

208
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,125
and you're lecturing
the supreme commander?

209
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,833
[TOKUGAWA]
Mitsunari, recall for me

210
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,375
the promise we made that day.

211
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,875
Our enemies are few!

212
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,541
Once reinforcements arrive, they
will lose their will to fight!

213
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,708
[ISHIDA]
Ieyasu!

214
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,166
[TOKUGAWA]
Mitsunari!

215
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,291
I have arrived with
Lord Hideyoshi's troops

216
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,375
under my command.

217
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,833
I've been waiting for you.

218
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,000
So those are the rebels who
dare to defy the Toyotomi.

219
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,208
[TOKUGAWA]
Yes.

220
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,208
Upon seeing the reinforcements
you brought,

221
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,291
they should surrender
before long.

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,125
What are you saying, Ieyasu?

223
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,666
These are guilty men,
who betrayed our lord.

224
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,291
I will not permit a
single one to live!

225
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,250
[TOKUGAWA]
Do not say that.

226
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,875
Rather than lives lost
to needless slaughter,

227
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,083
it will be the forging of
bonds with our fellow warriors

228
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,041
that will bring peace
to this country.

229
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,875
Our Lord Hideyoshi will not
tolerate such cajoling talk.

230
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,041
They're retreating?

231
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,500
[SOLDIERS murmur]

232
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,958
[SOLDIERS scream]

233
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,708
A trap? Mitsunari!

234
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,625
Curse you rebel scum!

235
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,083
[TOKUGAWA]
Mitsunari, wait!

236
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,666
[SOLDIERS yelling, groaning]

237
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,791
[TOKUGAWA]
Hidden archers?!

238
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,000
[ISHIDA groans]

239
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,583
Mitsunari!

240
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,666
[SOLDIERS yell]

241
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,083
This is what I meant!

242
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,250
Your soft ways will
kill our troops!

243
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,833
[TOKUGAWA grunts]

244
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,666
[ISHIDA] You handle the east.
I will take care of the west.

245
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,666
So be it.

246
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,166
[yells]

247
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,125
[yells]

248
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,875
[BOTH yelling]

249
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,875
[ISHIDA yells]

250
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,666
[TOKUGAWA yells]

251
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,291
[ISHIDA yells]

252
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,791
[TOKUGAWA yelling]

253
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,083
[ISHIDA]
It is over.

254
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,666
[TOKUGAWA]
Yes.

255
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,083
[TOKUGAWA]
Mitsunari.

256
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
[ISHIDA]
Hm?

257
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,208
I believe that bonds of
friendship are forged

258
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,583
even in the midst
of mighty battles.

259
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,875
It can even happen
between enemies.

260
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,958
I believe in the unified
nation he pursues, and...

261
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,375
in the friendship I
have forged with him.

262
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,958
[TOKUGAWA]
This may be fanciful of me,

263
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,666
but someday, my friend,
if I might have the chance,

264
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,250
I would like to try
fighting you as well.

265
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,833
[ISHIDA chuckles]
Then we will do it here.

266
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,541
Once Lord Hideyoshi has
united this country,

267
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,958
he will surely permit
us that much sport.

268
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,375
We will go petition
him together.

269
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,750
Indeed. It is a promise, then.

270
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,916
[TOKUGAWA]
Mitsunari.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,291
I beg of you.

272
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,416
Allow me this last
fanciful idea.

273
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,958
[footsteps]

274
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,041
[ISHIDA]
Hm?

275
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,083
[ISHIDA]
What is it?

276
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
Have you come to
lecture me again?

277
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,666
Master Ishida,

278
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,750
the reason I that looked to you
as the supreme commander

279
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,875
is because I judged that
you were a man worthy

280
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,500
of wagering everything
upon in this war.

281
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,250
Master Otani and all
the many other lords

282
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,875
may each have their
own thoughts, but...

283
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,458
It is because they too believe

284
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,458
that you are worth wagering
everything upon!

285
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,708
[ISHIDA grunts]

286
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,041
[SANADA] You do not understand
how we feel at all.

287
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,833
Lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi
died in the battle

288
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,458
for Odawara and he is not here!

289
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,541
[ISHIDA growls]

290
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,708
Damn you!

291
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,458
Lord Hideyoshi is gone,

292
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,250
yet people still rally
to the Toyotomi.

293
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,708
Look into their hearts!

294
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,708
I wish to fight
together with you,

295
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,166
because it was you.
That is how we all feel.

296
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,916
We all wish to hear
what is in your heart.

297
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,541
To hear your true voice.

298
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,291
Hmph. How surprising
that there would be one

299
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,666
other than Gyobu who would
admonish me as such.

300
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,708
[TOKUGAWA]
For the bond I share

301
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,875
with each and every one
of you gathered here,

302
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,625
let me express my gratitude.

303
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,916
I thank you all!

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,166
[TOKUGAWA SOLDIERS cheer]

305
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,916
Everyone! Hear me!

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,375
Hey, that's...

307
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,583
[ISHIDA] Since the most
ancient of times,

308
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,333
this foolish land of the rising
sun has long continued

309
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,541
to fight wars over
land. As a result,

310
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,333
it allowed for such brutality
as Oda Nobunaga, the Devil King.

311
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,750
Master Ishida.

312
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,708
[ISHIDA]
However, the Devil King, too,

313
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,500
died at the hands of betrayal.

314
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,208
When that happened, this
country truly ceased to exist.

315
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,416
We became exposed.
We became vulnerable.

316
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,833
[ISHIDA]
But the one who rose to action

317
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,708
with great strength and majesty
was Lord Hideyoshi!

318
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,833
Our Lord Hideyoshi tried
to change this country

319
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,125
into a strong country that
none could ever violate.

320
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,125
United under his rule,

321
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,250
this land of the rising
sun would become

322
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,958
a strong and enduring country!

323
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,583
But that Lord Hideyoshi
is no more.

324
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,291
That man, Tokugawa Ieyasu,
who had sworn his loyalty

325
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,708
to the Toyotomi, betrayed
and killed Lord Hideyoshi!

326
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,416
[ISHIDA]
He drew this country back

327
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,708
into the downward spiral
of war once again!

328
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,041
[TOKUGAWA]
This country is split in two.

329
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,458
The armies unified
under the Toyotomi

330
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,125
have declared themselves
the Western Forces.

331
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,291
They intend to rule

332
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,291
the land of the rising
sun with strength.

333
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,833
If they win, the land may
become united as one.

334
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,208
But is strength really
the way unite?

335
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,125
What do we do if an even greater
power emerges in our future?

336
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,458
How long?

337
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,791
How long can we be expected
to continue climbing

338
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,833
this endless staircase?
If there are any among you

339
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,708
who are dissatisfied
with my way,

340
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,041
or wish to join the
Western Forces,

341
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,125
I want you to feel
free to do so.

342
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:38,958
[ALL gasp]

343
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,708
Takechiyo, what are you...?

344
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,708
[DATE]
Hm...

345
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,958
[TOKUGAWA]
The battle we are about

346
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,625
to engage in is sure
to prove exacting.

347
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,375
Many will shed their blood
and lose their lives.

348
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,791
That is exactly why I want you

349
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,458
to think for yourselves
about this country's future.

350
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,416
Today we shall end the
bloody march of war!

351
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,208
[ISHIDA] The one who turned
traitor declares his yearning

352
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,875
for a peace that is
covered up with lies!

353
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,625
But I denounce it all!

354
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,625
No matter what words he
uses to mislead others,

355
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,666
there can be no truth in
something born of betrayal!

356
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,500
When I was young, I was weak.

357
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,375
I did not have the
means to live. Nay!

358
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,125
Not even a reason to live!

359
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,083
I was a creature who
merely breathed,

360
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,458
existing only to be beaten down.

361
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,833
It was Lord Hideyoshi

362
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,500
who gave me, that
creature, a life.

363
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,458
Lord Hideyoshi and Lord Hanbei,
I owe it to those two men.

364
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:42,333
It was only then that I came
to have a normal life.

365
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,625
You who survive may
ponder the future.

366
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,166
What lies beyond this battle
is unthinkable to me!

367
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,333
[TOKUGAWA] I raise my voice
for the bonds we share.

368
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,416
All of you have resolved
to forge a bond with me!

369
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,958
There is no rank,
higher or lower, here.

370
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,333
We are all comrades in arms!

371
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
So I want all of you
to believe as well.

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,791
That we will win this war.

373
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,791
That we will bring peace to
the land of the rising sun

374
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,833
for all eternity!

375
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,625
[TOKUGAWA SOLDIERS cheer]

376
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,208
Let's go!

377
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,041
What shall lead this country to
peace are the bonds between us!

378
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,458
[TOKUGAWA SOLDIERS cheer]

379
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,958
[DATE]
Hm.

380
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,375
[ISHIDA] There was nothing for
me except Lord Hideyoshi.

381
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:27,500
As I am now, I may not be worthy
of leading this great army.

382
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,375
As a general, I am hollow.

383
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,250
But even so, there were those
who put their faith in me.

384
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,166
To fill all the cracks
that I had left exposed,

385
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,958
there was one who
sullied his own hands.

386
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,708
Another swore that I
would have his support.

387
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,125
I am grateful,

388
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,541
and I want you to exchange
pledges with me!

389
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,875
That we will offer up
our lives to the fullest,

390
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,291
that we will fight,

391
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,166
and that we will win!

392
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,166
Now!

393
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,125
There is but one
thing we must do!

394
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,208
Condemnation to the
false bond that

395
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,166
the east holds aloft
as their banner!

396
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,791
Death to Ieyasu!

397
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,375
[OTANI]
Mitsunari.

398
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,708
Ha!

399
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:09,625
[TOYOTOMI SOLDIERS cheer]

400
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,791
[NARRATOR] With the country
hanging in the balance,

401
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,416
at long last, the battle
for supremacy begins.

402
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,375
[TOKUGAWA, ISHIDA]
All roads lead to Sekigahara!

403
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,625
[NARRATOR]
Next time: "Sekigahara."
