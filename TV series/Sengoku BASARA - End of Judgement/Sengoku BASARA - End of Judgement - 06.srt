[NARRATOR]
The Sengoku Period,

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,791
a time of chaos and bloodshed.

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,958
In this period
of warring states,

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,583
dozens of feudal lords
vied for supremacy,

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,833
hoping to unite this
land of the rising sun.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,333
Some fought as though blind,

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,000
having lost sight of
their righteous cause.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,041

battles would only serve

I do not fear meeting my end.

You've seen our lord's

That's right. Doing it
quickly and correctly

00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,541
is sort of the Sarutobi
Sasuke calling card.

Incidentally, that was the

By the time I am done with you,

325
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,708
death will be a mercy
you'll beg me to dispense!

326
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,791
That's all it is?

327
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you think Lord
Hideyoshi would wish for you

328
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,583
to demean yourself
with some petty vendetta!

329
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,541
Take these words to heart.

[gasps]

331
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,125

I already lost to you once.
So whatever happens,

336
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,125
just know this ain't about me

337
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,416
trying to back out
of our alliance.

338
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,750
Then why are we
squaring off again?

339
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,541
You must have some
problem with me, Masamune.

340
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,875
The only problem
I got, is with me!

341
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,791
Check it out.

342
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
I'm gonna give you a
real fight this time!

343
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,583

Look at you!

How could you ever know my pain?

350

I know it well!

351
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
I too, have lost my master.

352
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,875
And struggled under the weight
of an impossible burden.

353
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,958
You.

354

You couldn't be more wrong!

The Takeda are strong.

[SANADA]
For all of our differences,

366
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,291
Master Ishida and I,

367
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,541
are the same.

See what I can do when
my head's on straight?
