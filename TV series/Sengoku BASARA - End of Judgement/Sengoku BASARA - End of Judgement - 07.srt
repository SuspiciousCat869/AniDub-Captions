Heh. Just know this,
if things go south,

160
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,916
I've got your back.

161
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,583
What's her story, huh?

162
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,125
The one riding with Tenkai.

163
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
I don't know.

164
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,458
She was introduced to
me as Tenkai's ninja.

165
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,875
[KASUGA]
She's a ninja?

166
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,041
Something mighty
fishy about all this.

167
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,083
So you've returned.

168
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,375
You won the west
over to our cause.

169
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,791
[CHOSOKABE]
Spare me the three-gun salute.

170
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,250
I gotta ask you somethin',
captain to captain.

171
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,750
Go ahead.

172
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,958
Did my sons-of-bitches die
'cause of an order you put out?

173
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,750
Of what do you speak?

174
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,416
[CHOSOKABE]
I assumed as much.

175
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,458
You're no true captain.
You're a figurehead.

176
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,041
[ISHIDA] Again, brigand:
explain yourself.

177
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,166
[CHOSOKABE] The gutless cur who
slaughtered my sons-of-bitches,

178
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,708
and left 'em in a
heap for me to find!

179
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,625
He's one of yours, Ishida!

180
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,916
He's what?

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
[CHOSOKABE] I can't waste
my one eye watching

182
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,208
my so-called allies.
You can count me out.

183
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,916
[ISHIDA]
The price of betrayal...

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,375
is death!

185
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,875
[CHOSOKABE]
Betrayal?

186
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,500
You sure you wanna
play that card,

187
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,458
after one of your
mates killed my crew?

188
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,291
You're losing one man.
I lost 'em all.

189
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,875
[ISHIDA]
Begone with you!

190
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,208
And pray we do not meet on
the battlefield, deserter!

191
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,625
[CHOSOKABE]
You better hope that we don't.

192
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
You have such honest eyes.

193
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,833
If only you knew where to look.

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,250
Gyobu.

195
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,875
[OTANI]
You sound troubled, Mitsunari.

196
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,083
[ISHIDA]
Chosokabe has withdrawn.

197
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
[OTANI]
Really?

198
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,000
[ISHIDA] The sneak attack
on Shikoku. Did you know?

199
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,875
[OTANI]
How could I have known?

200
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,708
[ISHIDA]
Do not lie to me, Gyobu.

201
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,625
My patience wears
dangerously thin.

202
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,625
With silence you confess it.

203
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:16,625
Never go behind my back again,
if you value your life.

204
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,791
Lord Hideyoshi.

205
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,541
[KASUGA]
Best of luck getting in there.

206
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,000
[SARUTOBI] Wha...? Don't tell
me you're heading out?

207
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,083
[KASUGA] You're a big boy,
Sasuke. You don't need my help.

208
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,833
She sure is sassy for a ninja.

209
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,333
Oda's men are keeping watch.

210
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,416
And Kasuga's not
going in with us.

211
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,708
[SANADA]
I see.

212
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,416
Our luck has been
good so far,

213
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,000
but how do we figure out where
Lady O-Ichi is locked away?

214
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,125
[TENKAI]
All we have to do is ask.

215
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,708
But, why would they tell?

216
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,666
[gasping]

217
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,958
[TENKAI]
Good evening.

218
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,708
Who-Who are you?

219
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,708
[TENKAI]
Where might I find Lady O-Ichi?

220
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
Huh? U-Uh, uh...!

221
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,708
[TENKAI]
Tell me, or your skull is in

222
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,125
for the most tragic parting
with your quivering spine.

223
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,208
She... She's underground.

224
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,666
[TENKAI]
Many thanks, good sir.

225
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,458
[TENKAI] Come. Shall we
"head" below, my friends?

226
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,708
[TENKAI chuckles]

227
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,250

229
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,083
[SANADA]
Lady O-Ichi!

230
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,500
Wait! We've come to rescue you!

231
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,250
[SANADA, SARUTOBI grunting]

232
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,208
[BOTH gasp]

233
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,750
The legendary ninja.

234
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,916
Master! It's a trap!

235

[KEIJI]
Uh. Matsu! Thank goodness!

238
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,375
[KEIJI]
Matsu?

239
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,166
There's something
wrong with her.

240
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,750
She appears to be in
some sort of trance.

241
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,583
[TENKAI]
Set your fears to rest.

242
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,500
Lady Matsu is a person
of great value.

243
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,958
She's been very well
taken care of.

244
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,125
That voice. You sound like...

245
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,833
[TENKAI]
My name is Tenkai.

246
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,541
Whomever you take me for,
you're sorely mistaken.

247
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,416
Heh. Our soldiers are at
your front and your back.

248
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
And we've got you outnumbered!

249
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,583
Time to surrender!

250
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,541
[TENKAI chuckles] You think we'd
traipse into an enemy stronghold

251
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,000
with so paltry a force?

252
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:50,916
What?!

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,416

[TOKUGAWA SOLDIER F]
We're under attack!

258
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,208
They carry the Oda banner!

259
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,041
Huh? What did you just say?

260
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,500
[TOKUGAWA SOLDIER F]
The Oda are attacking us!

Tell me, what are
you planning to do?!

268
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,500
[TENKAI] She is going to
lead me to Lady O-Ichi.

269
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,375
I'm feeling rather
nostalgic tonight.

270
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,333
Things're getting hairy.

271
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,750
So, what do we do?

272
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,291
[SANADA growls] Everywhere
I look they block our way!

[TSURUHIME]
I know that he's here.

Where could you be,
my feathery beloved?

276
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,125
Uh! Is someone watching?

277

Hm...

Uh! What in the world?

Ranmaru. Is that you?

[SAKAI]
We still hold the advantage!

you can do?

We're not leaving
without Lady O-Ichi!

come to visit me?

319
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,500
In a cave under Sunpu
Castle, apparently.

320
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,833
Master, look who she's holding.

321
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,666
Isn't that...?

322
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,666
Kasuga.

323
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,208
Oh, no.

324
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,708
There's O-Ichi.

325
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,500
The Devil Lord's sister.

326
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,041
[ISONO]
Have no fear!

327
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,583
Your loyal retainers are
coming to your rescue!

328
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:31,166
Look at the beautiful
flowers I've gathered.

329
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,125
[ISONO groaning]

330
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,041
What is the meaning
of this treachery?

331
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,083
[TENKAI]
I do this for all our sakes.

332
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,541
[ISONO groans]

333
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,333
But now, they're fading away.

334
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,875
They grow brittle and die.

335
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,916
[TENKAI laughs]

337
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,375
[TENKAI]
All of you, rejoice.

338
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,000
In death, you
become cornerstones

339
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,333
of Oda's resurrection.

340
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,916
[KEIJI] You're bringing
him back? That's impossible!

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
[TENKAI] I think events
will prove otherwise.

342
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,625
The Devil King demanded
total allegiance,

343
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,625
down to one's very
flesh and blood.

344
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,958
His sister stands at the
crossroad between worlds.

345
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,416
By giving her this sacrifice,

346
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,291
Lord Nobunaga's body and
soul will converge!

347
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:26,250
Ah... He shall live again!

348
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,750
Once was bad enough!

349
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:34,708
[TENKAI gasps]
We two shall be just as we were.

350
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,416
There was a time
when you served Oda.

351
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,083
Now, serve him again.

352
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,458
[KEIJI]
Leave her alone!

353
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,250
[SANADA]
Have you lost your mind, Tenkai?

354
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,208
Stop this!

355
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,250
[TENKAI]
How dare you?!

356
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,166
You know nothing of
what drives me, boy!

357
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,291
You are a man devoid of honor!

358
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,666
[KEIJI] Thanks for keeping
him busy over there, man!

359
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,375
[ICHI screams]

360
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,666
[SAIKA]
Hurry!

361
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,833
[KEIJI]
Right!

362
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,833
Master! Time to go!

363
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,041
[SANADA]
Understood!

364
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,291
[TENKAI laughs]

365
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,750
[ICHI screams]

366
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,958
[SARUTOBI, SANADA gasp]

367
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,375
Brave Kasuga deserved
a better fate.

368
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,375
[KEIJI]
You gotta wake up!

369
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,583
Don't do this, Matsu!

370
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,666
[gasping] K-Keiji.

371
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,125
I thought I lost you!

372
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,916
[KEIJI]
Welcome back.

373
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,416
My Lord Hideyoshi,

374
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,083
leading men in times of war came
as easily to you as breathing.

375
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:20,250
Forgive me. I dishonor
your legacy.

376
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,666
[ISHIDA gasps]

377
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,000
[TOKUGAWA]
You know,

378
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,708
I had a feeling I
might find you here.

379
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,666
[ISHIDA growls]
Ieyasu!

380
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,541
[TOKUGAWA]
Please, just listen!

381
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,666
Ishida.

382
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,375
I didn't come here
looking for a fight!

383
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,875
[ISHIDA] You murdered a
man who trusted in you!

384
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,208
And now you have the gall
to stand at his grave

385
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,833
and say you come in peace?!

386
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,875
[TOKUGAWA]
It's true!

387
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,125
Hideyoshi's blood
is on my hands.

388
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,625
But we could end this
war in but a moment!

389
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,916
A war that your
treachery begat!

390
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,708
You, and your empty
words about friendship!

391
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,500
If you truly wish to spare
this land an era of carnage,

392
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,250
hang your guilty head and
let me strike it asunder!

393
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,750
Enough. Just stop
this, Mitsunari.

394
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,333
[ISHIDA] First you kill!
Then you sue for peace!

395
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,041
I am not a doll to
dance at your whim!

396
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,541
You coward!

397
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,750
It doesn't matter
where you run to!

398
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,125
I will have my vengeance!

399
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,625
You'll find me,

400
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,083
where we promised
to meet one day!

401
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,958
"Where we promised to meet."

402
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,083
[NARRATOR]
Next time, "Promise."
