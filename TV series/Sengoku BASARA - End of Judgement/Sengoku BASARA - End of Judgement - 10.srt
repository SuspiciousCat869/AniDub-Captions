It was reduced to

329
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,250
I accept your challenge!

330
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,000
Come, Voracious Tiger of Takeda!

331
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,875
[SANADA yells]

332
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
[TOKUGAWA yells]

333
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,166
[SANADA yelling]

334
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,916
[TOKUGAWA yelling]

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,125
[BOTH grunt]

336
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,000
[SOLDIERS yelling]

337
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
[BOTH yell]

338
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,833
[BOTH grunt]

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,666
[OTANI]
Hm? What is that?

340
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,333
[KATAKURA] Looks like
Sanada and Tokugawa

341
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,041
are locked in a battle
for supremacy.

342
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,666
[OTANI]
Your commander is under attack.

343
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,166
How can you be so calm?

344
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,250
Unlike your forces, we're
all equals in the east.

345
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,291
Besides my only commander
is Lord Date Masamune.

346
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,500
[OTANI]
Mm...

347
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,875
And at this moment,

348
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:45,166
I'm not interested in anything
except taking you down!

349
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,250
[KASUGA]
Isn't that...?

350
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,208
[SARUTOBI]
Yeah.

351
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,458
Guess it's begun.

352
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,541
Don't you need to go help him?

353
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
The commander has grown.

354
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,375
He doesn't need any
more help from me.

355
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,583
[SHIMAZU grunts]

356
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,625
[SHIMAZU] Ya got no time for
distractions, Master Tadakatsu!

357
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,375
I sense it!

358
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,416
The energy of the
Tiger within you!

359
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,333
I can detect the vital energy
of your Tiger as well,

360
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,208
Master Tokugawa!

361
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,958
[BOTH grunt]

362
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,458
It's strong.

363
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,833
You must've struggled and fought
hard to face your demons!

364
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,666
I wrestled with it.

365
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,166
We both revere Shingen
as our mentor and yet,

366
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,500
it makes no sense.

367
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,708
How could you and I
end up so different?!

368
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,416
Did you realize why that was?

369
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,125
[SANADA] All I was doing
was walking behind my lord,

370
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,333
in his shadow.

371
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,458
But you...

372
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,458
Your perception was
keener that mine.

373
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,583
You were able to recognize
the true nature

374
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,250
of His Lordship's spirit.

375
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,666
Yes.

376
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,041
Lord Shingen has the
strength of bonds.

377
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,250
He's honest.

378
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,666
And his spirit has won
the hearts of many,

379
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,708
forging bonds with them all.

380
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,041
With you and I, and
every citizen of Kai.

381
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll go even further!

382
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,291
I hope to forge bonds
with all the people

383
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,666
of our tumultuous land!

384
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Really?

385
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,208
All of them?

386
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,958
I think you're mistaken.

387
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,291
[gasps]

388
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,041
[SANADA]
His Lordship has crossed swords

389
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,958
with Lord Uesugi
times beyond counting

390
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,625
and a bond was forged
between them.

391
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,125
Strengthening with every clash.

392
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,833
But what you are doing...

393
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,791
It looks to me as though you
are severing those bonds!

394
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,875
[gasps]

395
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,041
[SANADA]
What I have set my gaze upon,

396
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,875
that is the real
heart of the Tiger,

397
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,500
which turns his
eyes upon himself.

398
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,416
As the elder Tiger's disciple,

399
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,750
I will now reveal
this truth to you!

400
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,708
[SANADA yelling]

401
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,500
[TOKUGAWA yells]

402
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,041
[TOKUGAWA gasps]

403
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,416
[gasps]

404
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,916
What will you do, Tiger?

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,500
[SANADA growls]

406
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,541
[gasps]

407
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,458
[SANADA yells]

408
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,791
Wha...?

409
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,208
[TOKUGAWA chuckles]
Shared bonds and heart.

410
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,333
Real strength.

411
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,875
Lord Shingen's spirit
is truly vast.

412
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,083
Beyond vast.

413
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,083
And it is my duty to
safeguard this spirit

414
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,625
I have inherited
from His Lordship.

415
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,250
[TOKUGAWA]
True.

416
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,500
[SANADA] Though I may be granted
half the land of the rising sun,

417
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,625
my desire will never change.

418
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,333
This is the truth of my soul

419
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,666
that will forever echo
throughout the heavens.

420
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,958
You are the Tiger's
rightful heir.

421
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,291
Without doubt.

422
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,125
[SANADA gasping]

423
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,708
[TOKUGAWA]
Sanada?

424
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,208
[SANADA gasping]

425
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,666
Don't strain yourself!

426
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,958
[SANADA groans]

427
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,458
I'll keep getting
up, no matter what!

428
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,291
My soul burns with desire.

429
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,958
The feelings in my heart urge
me to fulfill the promise

430
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,041
I made to Lord Masamune!

431
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,958
You, too, must face
the true feelings

432
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,541
taking root in your heart.

433
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,208
My heartfelt desire?

434
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,750
[TOKUGAWA]
My promise.

435
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,416
[footsteps]

436
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,291
Not you again.

437
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,041
[DATE] Time to settle the
score from the day we met.

438
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,333
It won't be pretty!

439
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,791
[NARRATOR]
Next time: "Verdict."
