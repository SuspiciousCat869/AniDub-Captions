myself with you.

Seems like just yesterday,

of innocent little kids.

started keeping secrets

from Tadakatsu and I.

00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,458
I wish he'd depend
on me more, you know?

181
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to do banquets and
world-building and all that.

I fully understand. You
feel alone, am I correct?

Huh?

Never you worry, my

Yes.

take place within your soul!

191
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,333
Now, brother,
your baptismal name

00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,208
will be Revolution!

Come, let us sing
hymns together!

194

[TACHIBANA] Is this some
kind of twisted joke?

we have accomplished
our prime goal.

Ignore it.

Hey!

Using the sun to roast people
alive is just wrong!

You come down from
there this instant!

Looks like they already started

has the upper hand offensively.

at an impasse.

Spineless bastard!

320
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,958
You would make Mitsunari
suffer even further betrayal?

321
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,125
I will curse you!

[TENKAI chuckles]
Come.

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,375
Make your offerings.

329
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,166
More flesh and blood!

What the...?

Akechi Mitsuhide!

332
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,000
The Saika lady, huh?

333
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,416
Looks like things just
got more interesting.

334
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,083
[SAIKA] We will not allow
you to make this world

335
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,750
your plaything any longer!

336

It will take more than that

339
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,500
to slake his bloodthirst.

340

[SAIKA growls]

341

[gasps] That energy!

[TENKAI] Ah... So the
time has finally come.

00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,291
[SAIKA]
Aim!

Fire!

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,250
[gasps] What's that?

347
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,416
[TENKAI]
Now. Lady O-Ichi.

348
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,958
Welcome your elder brother back.

349
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,458
Lady O-Ichi!

350
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,833
[ICHI]
I know you...

351

Master Akechi.

352
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,166

killed my brother.

[TENKAI laughs]
Soon, this valley of Sekigahara.

356
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,583
Shaped by the conflict
between Ieyasu and Ishida,

357
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,291
shall be filled with
the hatred of the living

358
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,166
and the dogged
rancor of the dead.

359
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,083
Now, Lady O-Ichi.

360
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,375
Open the gate that connects
to the world beyond!

361
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,083
No. Help me!

362

No!

[TENKAI] Return to life
from the world beyond.

364

Come.

Please awaken, Lord Nobunaga!

Devil King of the Sixth Heaven!

[TENKAI laughs]

368
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,625
They would dare to desecrate
this sacred battle

369
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,416
between Ieyasu and myself?

370
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,208
Curse the damned Devil King!

371
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,583
Master Ishida.

372
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,333
I ask that you now order me
in to battle, Commander!

373

[gasps]

374
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,875
[SANADA] After all,
I cannot stand idly by

375
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,708
and let this sacred battle
become desecrated!

376
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,833
I give the order,
Sanada Yukimura!

377
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,000
Thwart this nefarious
plot immediately!

378
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,125
I shall!

379
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,791
With all the fire
burning in my soul!

380
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,500
And now, to battle!

Heh. Nope. Don't like it.

[TOKUGAWA]
Hm?

386
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,250
We put everything on
the line for this battle.

387
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,625
Now this hell-cloud comes
'round tryin' to ruin my fun?

388
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,291
I'll be damned if I
let it get in the way.

389
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,625
Might as well see what
I can do about it.

390
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,958
Go, and good hunting.

Kojuro! We're movin' out!

Sir!

This party's about
to turn rough.

394
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,458
Let's get ready to rumble! Yeah!

395

Next time: "Life-and-Death."
