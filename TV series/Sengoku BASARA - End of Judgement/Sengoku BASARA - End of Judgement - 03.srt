[NARRATOR]
The Sengoku Period,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,708
a time of chaos and bloodshed.

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,958
In this period of
warring states,

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,625
dozens of feudal lords
vied for supremacy,

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,833
hoping to unite this
land of the rising sun.

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,458
Toyotomi Hideyoshi
came within one step

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,875
of seizing the country.

8
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,333
But his ambitions were
crushed by Tokugawa Ieyasu,

9
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,041
who had previously sworn
his loyalty to the Toyotomi.

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,416
Tokugawa Ieyasu's rebellion
sparked a new conflict.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,041
Warriors torn asunder by fate.

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,583
[NARRATOR] With all roads,
leading to Sekigahara.

13
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,458
[TOKUGAWA]
I hereby declare!

14
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,000
I will unify this land

15
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,708
with the strength of
the bonds we share!

16
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,958
I will rid this land of war!

17
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,333
And to do that,
I need your strength!

18
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,250
The strength of
your bond with me!

19
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,875
[cheering]

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,416
I must leave you now.

21
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,208
I go to forge new bonds with
those who share the same ideals.

22
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,458
Hold down the fort!

23
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,291
[ALL]
Yeah!

24
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,583
[SAKAI]
Sir!

25
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,041
Enemy territory
alone is dangerous.

26
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,375
Let me come with you.

27
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,791
[TOKUGAWA]
Not to worry.

28
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,291
I'll have Tadakatsu, the
greatest warrior in the land.

29
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,208
[TOKUGAWA]
Without a doubt,

30
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,416
the war ahead will be greater

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,208
than any that has
come before it.

32
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,375
Once it comes to pass,
many will die.

33
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,166
Not only our foes,

34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,041
but surely even a great number
of those who believe in me.

35
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,041
However.

36
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,416
There can be no
turning back now.

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,583
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile.

38
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,333
Takeda Shingen,
who collapsed in the midst

39
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,791
of fighting the Tokugawa,

40
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,916
had yet to regain consciousness,

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,958
and was lying in his sickbed.

42
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,333
[SANADA]
Your Lordship.

43
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,375
Please open your eyes.

44
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,541
Without your invaluable
guidance, I am lost.

45
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,875
Master. I get it, really,

46
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,833
but would you just
knock it the hell off?

47
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,625
Right now, the commander
of the Takeda is you.

48
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,250
So pull it together before
we all pay the price.

49
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,333
[SANADA scoffs] The Takeda
of Kai have no commander

50
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,000
but His Lordship.

51
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,750
And I am but one of his men.

52
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,250
[sighs]

00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,333
[NARRATOR]
Elsewhere,

54
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,958
in an effort to
counter the Tokugawa,

55
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,000
the Toyotomi side made
plans for renewed action.

56
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,083
[OTANI]
Mitsunari.

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,916
I thought I might find you here.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,666
What do you want, Gyobu?

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,916
[OTANI] We have received
new intelligence.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,083
Tokugawa is building an
allied army in the east.

61
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,958
[ISHIDA] Hmph. So he will
deceive people again

62
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,791
with boasts of
false common bonds.

63
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,750
What could such a motley crew
possibly hope to accomplish?

64
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,958
[OTANI]
That depends.

65
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,666
What if he gains a powerful
mercenary force?

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,166
[ISHIDA]
Who? The Saika?

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,500
[OTANI]
The very same.

68
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,000
It is just the sort of
thing that man would try.

69
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,416
[ISHIDA]
Unforgiveable!

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,250
The Saika entered into a
contract with Lord Hideyoshi.

71
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,083
Joining with the Tokugawa would
be a betrayal most foul!

72
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,333
[OTANI] And yet, by the
terms of the Saika,

73
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,000
the contract becomes invalid

74
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,166
upon the death of
one of its holders.

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,625
Regardless.

76
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,000
To now align with Ieyasu?

77
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,708
I will not allow it!

78
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,375
[NARRATOR]
True to Otani's intel,

79
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,083
Tokugawa Ieyasu was indeed
visiting with Saika Magoichi,

80
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,500
the greatest
mercenary of her time.

81
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,000
The man who laid low the Taiko,

82
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,625
Toyotomi Hideyoshi, wants to
enter into a contract with us,

83
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,833
the Saika Faction?

84
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,958
Magoichi. It is my
wish to rule this land

85
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,541
through the strength of
the bonds we all share.

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,958
I want to create
a world without war.

87
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,125
And I want your help to do it.

88
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,291
And what if... we refuse?

89
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,416
[TOKUGAWA] I have no
intention of forcing you.

90
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,416
However, I believe we
share in the same goals.

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,416
Mercenaries have no goals.

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,750
I await your favorable reply.

93
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,458
There's some
beautiful land here.

94
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,666
The Saika are lucky.

95
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
Tadakatsu.

96
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,791
Instead of returning to Mikawa,

97
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,250
would you mind if
we made a few stops?

98
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,083
[NARRATOR]
About the same time,

99
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,750
there was one more
man on Ieyasu's trail.

100
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,875
Who was making his way
toward the Saika's home.

101
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,333
[CHOSOKABE]
Knowing Ieyasu,

102
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,500
he'll try negotiating with
Sayaka face-to-pretty face.

103
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,041
Just wait, Ieyasu.

I'm gonna beat you
to a bloody pulp!

322
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,500
They will kneel to Lord
Hideyoshi or they will suffer.

323
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,750
[OTANI]
Ah.

324
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,500
And I see you brought a
stray dog home with you.

325
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,291
Been standin' here
the whole time.

326
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,750
[ISHIDA]
Your description is apt.

327
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,333
He followed me.

328
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,416
[OTANI] There is nothing wrong
with having fighting strength.

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,708
It has been quite a
long time, o Triton.

330
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,666
As you are now a friend,
I shall find my manners,

331
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,208
Lord Chosokabe.

332
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,916
That's right! Y'better show
me some damn court--

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,833
[OTANI]
Yes, as I was saying.

334
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,083
Courtesy!

335
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,500
[OTANI] I hear Tokugawa
has secured Lady O-Ichi.

336
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,583
cajoled Hojo to his side,

337
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,583
and even gotten a hold of the
legendary ninja, Fuma Kotaro.

338
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,041
[growls]

339
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,416
[OTANI] And then, to attempt
to recruit even the Saika.

340
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,583
The fight over the
gameboard's remaining pieces

341
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,083
will grow much fiercer.

342
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,625
[grunts]
Ieyasu.

343
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,791
Guess the man
really has changed.

344
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,125
Dammit.

345
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,791
In spite of that
look in his eyes,

346
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,166
I gotta avenge my
sons-of-bitches!

347
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,250
So there it is, I'm comin'
on board with you guys.

348
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,916
Besides! I've decided
I like you!

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,375
You seem to have
honest eyes too.

350
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,916
[TOKUGAWA]
War God,

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,416
I wish to enter into
an alliance with you.

352
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,958
[UESUGI] A man who has those
same eyes as you has fallen ill.

353
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,083
And my heart has been
locked in ice ever since.

354
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,208
Explain how it is that you
have the same Tiger's eyes

355
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,583
as that man!

356
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,625
I learned more from my
battle against Lord Shingen

357
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,500
than I could have imagined.

358
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,666
I learned all about defeat.

359
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,750
I learned all about
the art of war.

360
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,791
But mostly, I learned the way.

361
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,958
I consider Lord
Shingen my mentor.

362
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,500
If my eyes resemble
the Tiger of Kai's,

363
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,250
that must be the reason.

364
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,250
I see.

365
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,958
Though you have succumbed
to illness, my rival.

366
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,458
It is clear your soul
remains ever present

367
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,041
upon the battlefield.

368
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,125
As the Tiger's successor,
surely you can understand

369
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,958
my intention to quietly
await his return.

370
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,291
Indeed. But it's too bad.

371
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,875
Tosho.

372
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,750
There is one other
Tiger lying aslumber.

373
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,958
[TOKUGAWA]
I know.

374

[grunting]

375
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,583
What business brings
you here, Lord Tokugawa?

376
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,541
I am ready for battle if
your answer deems it!

377

[gasping]

378

[TOKUGAWA]
Hold, Tadakatsu!

379
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,416
Sanada, I did not come
here today to make war.

380
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,750
I wish to pay my respects
to Lord Shingen.

381
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,250
Your respects?

382
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,958
It was in battle against you
that His Lordship collapsed!

383
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,750
And you dare speak of respect?

384
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,083
That is why I've come.

385
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,250
Lord Tokugawa.

386
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,583
I'm so sorry,

387
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,125
but our commander's about
to pop a vein right now.

388
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,333
Any chance we could
do this another time?

389
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,625
I understand.

390
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,208
But I do respect your lord,
and I will return.

391
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,458
The Tokugawa wish to enter into
an alliance with the Takeda.

392
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,458
[gasps]

393
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,958
I will not allow it!

394
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,625
Under no circumstances will
we accept such an alliance!

395
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,291
Master! Calm yourself!

396
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,083
How could I possibly be calm?!

397
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,916
Another time, Sanada.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,958
[SANADA grunts]

399
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,208
[SARUTOBI]
Well, Master? What's the plan?

400
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,875
We don't currently stand much
of a chance against them.

401
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,625
I am aware!

402
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,750
But to forge an alliance
with an opponent who has

403
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,458
just defeated us in battle
is the same as surrendering.

404
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,125
That cannot come to pass!

405
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,458
Anything but that!

406
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,000
[SARUTOBI]
So, what then?
