The Sengoku Period,

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,791

[SOLDIERS shouting]

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,458
[NARRATOR] In this
period of warring states,

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,291
dozens of feudal lords
vied for supremacy,

6
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,250
hoping to unite this
land of the rising sun.

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,500
[NARRATOR]
Among them, Oda Nobunaga,

8
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,875
who had nearly brought the
entire country under his rule.

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,625
[NARRATOR]
But at Honnoji Temple,

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,250
he was betrayed and laid low

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,875
by his retainer,
Akechi Mitsuhide.

12
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:47,291
However, Akechi himself was
laid low by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

13
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,916
And the world was once again

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,583
plunged into the
maelstrom of war.

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,166
Recruiting one
warlord after another,

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,166
Toyotomi quickly became
a force to be reckoned with.

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,000
Many a feudal lord
fell before his might,

18
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,750
and the number who openly
defied him grew thin.

19
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,333
The Toyotomi Army was now

20
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,375
on the verge of engulfing
even Hojo in the east.

21
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,583
As if to rise in rebellion
against Toyotomi,

22
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,625
one man rode in haste to Hojo
Ujimasa's Odawara Castle.

23
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,625

If they have already

respond swiftly--

In times such as this,
