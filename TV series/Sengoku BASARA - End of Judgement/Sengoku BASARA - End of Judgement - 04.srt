00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:08,875
[NARRATOR]
The Sengoku Period,

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,916
a time of chaos and bloodshed.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this period of
warring states,

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,750
dozens of feudal lords
vied for supremacy,

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,791
hoping to unite this
land of the rising sun.

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,875
One takes up arms to
regain his wounded pride.

7
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,750
One grapples with the
weight of his lord's mantle.

8
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,833
[NARRATOR] While another's
heart is set ablaze

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,083
with loyal vengeance.

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:35,750
And another bloodies his fists
in the name of brotherhood.

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,291
One by one,
alliances are forged.

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,625
With all roads,
leading to Sekigahara.

13
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,541
[SANADA]
Today, men, we go to war!

14
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,416
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS cheer]

15
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,541
Hold on, master!
What is the meaning of this?

16
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,125
[SANADA] Your timing
couldn't be better, Sasuke.

17
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,958
Come and share in this victory!

18
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,750
What? Who do you mean to fight?

19
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,708
Uesugi Kenshin,
War God of Echigo!

20
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Huh?!

21
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,166
[SANADA] Brave warriors
of Kai, follow me!

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,500
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS cheer]

23
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,041
[SARUTOBI]
Hold on a second!

24
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,208
What are you thinking?

25
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,958
[SANADA]
I've come to a realization.

26
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,083
Kai can have no true
ruler but our lord.

27
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,500
But, what's that got
to do with Kenshin?

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,833
[SANADA]
Don't you get it?

29
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,875
If our lord is the only
legitimate ruler of Kai,

30
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,583
then I have to adopt the actions
he'd undertake in his stead!

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,791
Huh?!

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,583
[SANADA] As the vessel
of Takeda's spirit.

33
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,166
I ride to face my rival,
Uesugi Kenshin!

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,833
[SANADA]
Onward, men! To glory!

35
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:13,875
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS cheer]

36
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,458
[SARUTOBI]
Seriously?

37
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,166
[SANADA]
This is Kawanakajima.

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,083
My lord and Lord Uesugi have
met here in battle many a time.

39
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,916
Our foe's territory
lies just beyond!

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,666
Why is it snowing?

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,250
[SARUTOBI]
Look out!

44
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,125
[grunts]

45
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,666
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS yell]

46
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,416
[SARUTOBI]
So, that happened.

47
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
[grunts, gasps]

48
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,000
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS gasp]

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,458
I should have guessed.

50
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,500
[UESUGI] I sensed your
approach from miles away.

51
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,250
[SARUTOBI]
Excuse me, War God?

52
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,250
There's something
you should know.

53
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,791
Don't try to explain
my actions away!

54
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,791
[SARUTOBI] Hm? You really mean
to go through with this?

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,666
Of course I do. I'm here
on our lord's behalf!

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,291
In that case,
do what you're gonna.

57
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,000
Lord Uesugi Kenshin.

58
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,416
I've come to fight you,
man to man!

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,750
Here for a duel?

60
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,500
I will oblige you, then.

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,916
Let loose the tiger
within your soul.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,541
I, Sanada Genjiro Yukimura,

63
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,250
will defeat you all for
the greater glory of Kai!

[SANADA yells] I wield this
axe as my lord's emissary!

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,833
You dishonor it with
all this dodging!

[yelling]

72
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,625

Stand and fight me!

[SANADA grunting]

74
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,041
Turmoil. That is all I
sense as I watch you teeter

75
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,291
under that axe's weight.

[growls]

[gasping]

84
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,458
[UESUGI] The Tiger of Kai
is a giant among men.

85
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,416
Why then do you sully his
spirit with this pantomime?

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,458
[gasps]

87
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,375
You're right.

88
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,750
My lord would never
be so foolish.

89
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,875
[UESUGI] You were closer
to him than any, and yet.

90
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,541
What can you claim to
know of your master?

91
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,833
Nothing.

92
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,291
[SANADA] All of that
time spent, and I know nothing.

93
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,250
[UESUGI]
What did you learn at his knee?

94
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,750
[SANADA]
Nothing.

95
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,416
[SANADA]
His wisdom, was wasted on me.

00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,708
[UESUGI]
Tell me.

98
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,625
How have you carried yourself?

99
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,666
[grunts]

100
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,041
[SANADA]
All I've done.

101
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,750
Was march along behind him,
and ape his every move.

102
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,958
[gasps]
Forgive me.

Feel shame, young tiger.
Shame at your ignorance.

109
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,416
Let it burn until
you are emptied.

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,625
And then, when the
flames have subsided...

111
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,500
...take pride in
how you've grown.

112
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,583
Your master was right to entrust
you with the future of Kai.

[SANADA gasps]

114

What have I done?

115
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,333
The Tiger has not
left this world.

116
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,583
His soul endures in
the heart of the man

with whom he's crossed
blades so many a time.

That's our guy.

He's nothing if not sincere.

[sobbing continues]

123
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,666
[UESUGI] The Uesugi will

East-West conflict.

125

Fight however your
heart leads you,

00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,125
secure in my guarantee
that we will not attack

the Takeda from behind.

128
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,583

Hm?

00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,833
Gotcha.

00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,208
I'll try to keep him from
going off half-cocked.

lend them the benefit

Huh?

135
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,791
[UESUGI] Shepherd this
war down its rightful path.

136
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,416
But my lord--

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,458
[KASUGA gasps]

138
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,875
No one else can
do this for me.

139
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,625
[gasps]
If it pleases you.

140
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,041
Oh, yes!

141
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:02,375
Yes, Lord Kenshin!
A thousand times, yes!

142
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,833
What the--?

143
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,458
[TAKEDA SOLDIERS chattering]

144
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,541
[SANADA]
I acted rashly today.

145
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,625
[SARUTOBI]
Hm?

146
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,541
[SANADA] We have
made the right decision.

147
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,666
I, Yukimura, will fight
Lord Tokugawa.

148
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,958
We will regain the pride of
Kai from he who took it.

149
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,916
I am glad to see you've
found your resolve,

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,125
Master, but you know...

151
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,666
You needn't say it.

152
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,791
As we stand at present, we have
no chance against Tokugawa.

153
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,250
So our victory depends
on forging an alliance

154
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,791
with another lord.

155
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,416
Master Ishida seems a likely
choice, given their history.

156
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,541
Oh yeah. He hates that guy.

157
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,041
[SANADA] I mean to make for
Osaka Castle straightaway

158
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,708
and present my offer.

159
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,208
Diplomacy's a new tack
for you. That said...

160
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,458
It wouldn't do for you
to appear too eager.

161
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,750
You say here. I'll handle this.

162
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,708
What exactly are
you going to do?

163
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,666
[SARUTOBI]
Don't worry.

164
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,291
I've got it covered.

165
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,875
And, I've got back-up.

166
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,250
[SANADA]
The <i>shinobi</i> ?

167
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,458
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

168
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,083
Tokugawa Ieyasu was
heading for Ujo Castle,

169
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,875
and its master,
Kobayakawa Hideaki.

170
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,916
Aw, how come daikon radish
takes so long to cook

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,250
all the way through, huh?

172
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,083
I'm hungry right now!

173
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,083
--[TOKUGAWA clears throat]
--[KOBAYAKAWA] Hm?

174
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,791
[gasps]

175
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,625
[KOBAYAKAWA] Ieyasu!
You're not supposed to be here!

176
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,708
Just go away!

177
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,416
You can't control
who might show up.

178
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,000
No one will blame you.

179
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,708
[KOBAYAKAWA] But if Lord Mori or
Mitsunari were to find you here,

180
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,125
they'd serve you up a
whole banquet of pain!

181
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,166
I know the risk I'm taking.

182
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,958
I came, to ally myself with you.

183
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,625
Let us shake hands
on it, like men.

184
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,000
Nobody ever treats
me like a man!

185
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,916
[MORI] Know your place,
you simpering glutton.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,541
[ISHIDA] Irritate me
and I'll run you through.

187
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,958
[KOBAYAKAWA] But, w-who knows
what they'll do to me

188
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,666
if I betray them!

189
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:57,166
[KOBAYAKAWA whimpers]

190
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,833
You'll make the choice
that's right for you.

191
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,166
Until then.

192
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,083
What am I gonna do?

193
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,125
Now I'm hungry and confused
and scared, all at once!

194
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,666
[TENKAI]
You're going to be just fine.

195
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,333
Simply... do whatever
you think is right.

196
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,291
Mister Tenkai!

197
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,250
[NARRATOR] News of
Tokugawa Ieyasu's trip

198
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,291
to Ujo Castle reached
Osaka in the blink of an eye.

199
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,458
He what?!

200
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,416
With every breath, he vexes me!

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
[OTANI] Tokugawa has been ahead
of you at every turn thus far.

202
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,750
[ISHIDA]
Damn your eyes, Ieyasu!

203
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,333
[OTANI] Now it is my
turn to make a move.

204
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,708
[NARRATOR] Having entered
into a spur-of-the-moment

205
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,958
contract with the Saika Faction,
Maeda Keiji remained

206
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,500
in their compound, sifting
through their dispatches

207
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,083
for word of his abducted
sister-in-law, Matsu.

208
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,500
Wet out there.

209
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,541
Tsuruhime still
hasn't returned yet?

210
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,916
[SAIKA] It was her choice to
run off and see Tokugawa.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,666
Yeah. Tell me something.

212
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you do with
all these dispatches?

213
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,166
[SAIKA] Battles are won before
armies take to the field.

214
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,083
Thanks to this, we can make
every bullet count.

215
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
[KEIJI] That makes sense.
Heard any word from your

216
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,541
informants on Matsu's
whereabouts yet?

217
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,666
Not that I've seen so far.

218
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,166
Sorry.

219
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,916
[SAIKA gasps]

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,541
Bad news or what?

221
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:22,083
[SAIKA] Something's off about
Kobayakawa's troop movement.

222
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,625
He has soldiers?

223
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,666
[whimpers]

224
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,916
He has a few.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,208
Is he using them to
gather intelligence?

226
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,250
Or are they a part of,
something more?

227
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,333
[NARRATOR]
Just then, Ishida Mitsunari,

228
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,541
Otani Yoshitsugu
and Mori Motonari

229
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,833
paid a visit to
their timid comrade.

230
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,625
[KOBAYAKAWA whimpers] Please,
Mitsunari, just lemme go!

231
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,500
Did you meet with Ieyasu,
or did you not?

232
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course not!
That's crazy-talk!

233
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,916
[ISHIDA]
Lie and your life is forfeit!

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,166
Okay, I saw him!
Please don't kill me!

235
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,958
Did you agree to betray
Lord Hideyoshi's legacy?

236
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,666
Answer me!

237
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,458
No! Why would I do that?

238
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,291
Ieyasu came to see me
without any invitation!

239
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,416
I'm telling you the truth!

240
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,750
[ISHIDA] I'm disgusted
by the very sight of you!

241
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,625
I'm sorry!

242
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,708
[ISHIDA]
Treachery will be punished!

243
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,166
[KOBAYAKAWA whimpers]
C'mon, I said I was sorry!

244
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,333
[ISHIDA]
Talk to that smiling demon again

245
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,875
and I'll take your head!

246
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,500
[OTANI] And what are your
thoughts on this new wrinkle?

247
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,666
This weakling's
beneath my notice.

248
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,000
Terrorize him as you will.

249
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,708
I ventured here to
see another man.

250
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,291
You should follow suit.

251
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,833
[OTANI]
Hm?

252
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,125
[TENKAI] You have traveled far,
Lord Mori and Master Gyobu.

253
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,791
I am humbled by your attentions.

254
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,708
[MORI]
I would have your name.

255
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,208
What do you gain by
your machinations?

256
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,958
[TENKAI]
Machinations, my lord?

257
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,291
I am but a humble advisor
who tugs at his ear.

258
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,291
Koyabakawa would
never deal in betrayal.

259
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,208
He lacks the guile for it.

260
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,750
[MORI] You expect me to
believe this nonsense?

261
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,708
[TENKAI] I can prove that
our interests are aligned.

262
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,166
[MORI]
Prove it how?

263
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,750
[TENKAI]
Observe, good sirs.

264
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,708
[TENKAI]
Lady Matsu,

265
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,958
the wife of Maeda Toshiie
of the land of Kaga.

266
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,666
[MORI]
Why is she here?

267
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,125
[TENKAI]
I kidnapped her,

268
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:20,000
and laid blame for the
abduction at Ieyasu's feet.

269
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,958
What a fine ally her lovelorn
husband will make for us.

270
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:29,875
[MATSU whimpers]

271
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,208
[OTAN giggles] This stranger's
a man after my own heart.

272
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,916
[MORI]
His methods are brutish.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,583
[TENKAI]
I don't recall either of you

274
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,958
springing to free
her from captivity.

275
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,000
You expect to be
brought into the fold;

276
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,500
that is your insinuation?

277
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:52,208
[TENKAI] If you honor me thus,
you shall gain much by it.

278
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,750
[OTANI] In that case,
welcome, trickster.

279
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,125
[MORI]
You trust him?

280
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,666
[OTANI] The spear I wield today
may skewer me tomorrow.

281
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,125
He has his uses, Mori.

282
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,625
[MORI]
I hope that you are right.

283
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:11,291
[OTANI giggles] He fills my
nose with the scent of ruin.

284
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,750
His own, I trust.

285
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:18,041
[OTANI] We'll be receiving a
guest at Osaka Castle soon.

286
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,833
Let us prepare for them.

287
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,291
[SARUTOBI] You're as
quick as ever, I see.

288
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,708
[KASUGA]
And you're as talkative!

289
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,166
[SARUTOBI]
Sorry to rope you into this.

290
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,000
[KASUGA]
I'm not here for your sake.

291
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,500
My Lord Kenshin
commanded it, that's all.

292
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,541
[SARUTOBI chuckles]

293
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,833
[OTANI]
Show yourself, Takeda monkey.

294
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,458
I've been waiting.

295
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,000
[SARUTOBI]
You're pretty observant.

296
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,041
Guess we'll cut
to the chase, then.

297
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,333
Alliance. You in?

298
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,041
[OTANI] We have no desire to
drag a sickly Tiger about.

299
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,833
But I am perfectly willing to
discuss terms of surrender.

300
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,666
I know we've hit a rough patch,

301
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,875
but, you shouldn't write
off the Takeda just yet.

302
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,541
[OTANI]
It never hurts to be wary.

303
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,208
What say we put your
words to the test?

304
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,250
[BOTH
Huh?

305
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,125
[OTANI]

306
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,916

breached my chamber!

Are you hurt, Gyobu?

[OTANI]
Not in the slightest.

313

Ieyasu sent you?

314
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,000
You deal with him.
It's your mission!

315
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,083
Oh yeah.
