My thanks.

There's no need for thanks.

Only the payment,

If that is the case,

Formidable opponents,
are they not?

327
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,833
Indeed.

00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,583
But 'the crazier the
better' is the Date way.

[SOLDIERS cheer]

335
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,541
It's an endless party!
