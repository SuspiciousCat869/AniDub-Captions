1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,708
[TOKUGAWA]
Sanada. Tell me something.

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,833
Regarding Mitsunari.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,041
Does he still despise me?

4
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,500
[ISHIDA]
You are the one from that day.

5
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:57,250
Yes. That day at Odawara.
I'm the man who lost to you.

6
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,833
[ISHIDA]
Hmph.

7
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,000
And what brings that man
to stand before me now?

8
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,791
Have you come to be
defeated once more?

9
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,625
[DATE] Go on, get the
snark outta your system.

10
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,875
I ain't here for revenge or
anything stupid like that.

11
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,041
I just had a little
somethin' to say to you.

12
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,166
Well, to myself, actually.

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,125
Call it a statement.

14
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,000
You're just a bump in the road.

15
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,208
In other words...

16
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,125
I'm tellin' you "go to hell."

17
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,166
You see?

18
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,208
[ISHIDA] Your idle words
do not concern me.

19
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:41,208
However, if you mean to bar
me from my path to Ieyasu,

20
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,791
I will make it so you can never
open that yap of yours again.

21
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,041
[DATE]
Fantastic.

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,833
I'll have you know,
this guy here...

23
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,833
is deadly!

24
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,916
This is your punishment
for aligning with Ieyasu!

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,166
I will slice you down
to a one eyed snake!

26
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,583
Ha. Well, if you're gonna
be a dick about it!

27
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,458
[yelling]

28
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,958
[ISHIDA grunts]

29
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,583
Lord Masamune.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,666
[DATE] Ooh. Nice to see you're
just as good as I remember.

31
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,250
[SHIMAZU] Ha, ha, ha! Some
right interestin' things

32
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,875
are gettin' started down
there, too. [laughs]

33
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
[OTANI]
Are you sure you should be here?

34
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,458
Brave Katakura,

35
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,583
who declares himself the
Right Eye of the Dragon?

36
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,833
[KATAKURA grunts]
Are you worried about Ishida?

37
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,833
You can drop the
provocations, Otani.

38
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,708
My only duty is to do the job
that I've been entrusted with.

39
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,000
And besides.

40
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,625
As he is now,
Lord Masamune is strong!

41
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,958
[DATE]
Hmph.

42
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,916
[OTANI]
You are quite confident.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,291
[KATAKURA] This battle
is a line Lord Masamune

44
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,708
resolved to draw in
order to move forward.

45
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,083
The Dragon will race
across the heavens.

46
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,333
And I'm not going to let anyone
get in the way of that!

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,791
[OTANI chuckles] A dragon that
races across the heavens?

48
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
Funny you should say that.

49
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,791
[OTANI] Before he goes racing
across the heavens, how about I,

50
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,916
take out his right
eye here and now?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,333
[KATAKURA grunting]

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,583
[OTANI]
I despise this world!

53
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,666
People lie, deceive,
and ridicule.

54
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,583
[OTANI] I have seen it
time and time again.

55
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,458
Behold those stars.

56
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,916
[OTANI]
Even in their brilliance,

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,166
there is inequality.

58
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,000
In that case, people
and those glittering stars

59
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,791
can all fall to the ground.

60
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:12,666
And have misery bestowed
upon them in equal measure.

61
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,083
What?!

62
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,750
[OTANI]
It will be Mitsunari and I

63
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,083
who bring about that
world of equality!

64
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,958
Now, you star scraps,
come raining down,

65
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,541
tumbling out of the sky!

66
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,208
[OTANI laughs]

67
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,416
[KATAKURA]
So, Otani,

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,833
this was your intent
from the very beginning!

69
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,875
[OTANI]
Soon, my boy.

70
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,833
Very soon!

71
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,083
[KATAKURA gruns]

72
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:41,166
[OTANI] Soon, equal misery
will fall upon us all.

73
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,375
It will come from the far
reaches of the sky!

74
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,083
Streaming along!

75
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,291
Wave after wave!

76
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,000
[OTANI laughs]

77
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,583
[OTANI]
Katakura.

78
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,208
Can you not see it?

79
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,250
[KATAKURA]
Uh.

80
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,125
[KATAKURA grunts]

81
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,458
"Equal misery," you say?

82
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,666
[OTANI]
Yes!

83
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,625
Misery shared with all,
across the world!

84
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,166
For me as well?

85
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,708
[OTANI]
For you as well.

86
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,791
[KATAKURA]
And for yourself?!

87
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,125
[OTANI]
And for myself!

88
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,166
[KATAKURA]
For my Lord Masamune?

89
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,041
[OTANI]
Yes, for the One-Eyed Dragon!

90
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,250
And Ishida?

91
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,208
[OTANI]
Mitsunari?

92
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,708
[OTANI]
No, not him.

93
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:38,708
I shall allow no more misery
to befall Mitsunari!

94
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,833
[OTANI gasping]

95
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,583
[KATAKURA] You may be capable
of deceiving others, Otani.

96
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,166
But it seems you cannot
fool your own heart.

97
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,958
In fact, right at this moment,
you are the kindest man alive.

98
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,458
[OTANI exhales]

99
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:15,041
[OTANI]
M... M... Mitsunari.

100
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,625
Just what I expected, Tadakatsu!

101
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
Yer bein' known as
the warrin' states'

102
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,250
greatest warrior's no lie!

103
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,583
What fun this is!

104
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,833
[TOKUGAWA]
Tadakatsu.

105
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,291
I killed Lord Hideyoshi
with my own bare hands.

106
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,500
With these hands.

107
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
With my own strength.

108
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,750
No gettin' distracted now!

109
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,083
I'm an ol' fool,
behind the times,

110
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,208
I only know how to make war.

111
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,583
So I'm awful grateful to've
met up with ya here.

112
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,125
I'm gonna put all my
might behind this sword

113
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,791
and I want ya to fight it!

114
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:00,458
Here's a Shimazu
Jigen Style strike!

115
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,333
[SHIMAZU]
Toriya!

116
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,500
Ah!

117
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,166
T'was such a fine fight!

118
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,750
Damn!

119
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,291
Doesn't that pseudo-sun
have any dead angles to it?

120
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,208
[MORI] My Sun has no such
things as dead angles.

121
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,791
All movements thus far and
the course of this battle

122
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,208
have gone just as I predicted.

123
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,833
Here, upon Sekigahara,

124
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,166
it will be neither the
East nor the West,

125
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,791
but the land of Aki
to emerge victorious.

126
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,791
Once this matter is concluded,
I will become its divine oracle.

127
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,458
[CHOSOKABE growls]
You killed my sons-of-bitches,

128
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,791
you used me, and spurred Ishida

129
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,791
on to make a broken mess of
the land of the rising sun!

130
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,875
And that was all for yourself?!

131
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,750
You won't get away with it.

132
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,541
Mori, you're the one guy
I'm gonna make sure

133
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,291
doesn't get away!

[MORI chuckles]
Pathetic fool.

135
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,875
You have no sea, no
ship at your command.

136
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,250
You are run aground.

lost and wandering.

We're screwed, Captain!
There's nowhere left to run!

We're like fish in a barrel!

145
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,625
So it's a trap. then?

146
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
I'll show him a trap!

147
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,791
We just gotta soak up that
pain-in-the-ass sunlight

148
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,125
and then throw it back
at the dumb bastard!

Hmph.

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,458
