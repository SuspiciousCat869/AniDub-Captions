[NARRATOR]
The Sengoku Period,

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,541
a time of chaos and bloodshed.

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,208
Oda Nobunaga had nearly brought

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,625
the entire country
under his rule.

5
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,916
But at Honnoji, he was betrayed
and laid low by his retainer,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,791
Akechi Mitsuhide.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,708
After that,

8
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,833
Toyotomi Hideyoshi struck east,

9
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,958
and subdued much of the land.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,000
Before falling by the hand of
his retainer, Tokugawa Ieyasu.

11
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,625
Lord Hideyoshi. Your end is now!

12
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,833
I swear this, upon my life.

13
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:40,750
I... will... kill you!

Hats off to ya, kid.

But, Your Lordship!

Sasuke reports that
Toyotomi Hideyoshi

36
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,250
has met his end at Odawara!

Lord Shimazu, I most earnestly
beg your forgiveness--!

[SHIMAZU] You must be that

Yes, sir. Many thanks!

I'll take my leave now!

Yer a lucky bastard,
y'know that?

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,208
Having a young'un
to leave it all to.

[SARUTOBI]
My bad.

Hey! Next time,
I'll be sure to tie you up

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,916
before I give you
important news.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,291
Of all men, Tokugawa Ieyasu,
turned traitor.

59
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,125
You say it like it's a shock.

60
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,500
But maybe this is the
guy he's always been.

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,125
[ISHIDA]
He trusted you, Ieyasu!

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,750
[ISHIDA] And you struck,
like a thief in the night.

66
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,916
Grant me but one word
of comfort from beyond.

67
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,541
Allow me to join you.

68
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,958
[OTANI] Mitsunari, you are now
the master of this castle.

69
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,791
You are much mistaken, Gyobu.

70
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,916
Only Lord Hideyoshi could
lay claim to this castle,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,333
this clan, this country!

72

[ISHIDA sobs]

73
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,750
[OTANI] Then this is
the darkest of days.

74
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,458
With none to champion
Hideyoshi's memory,

75
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,416
Tokugawa will conquer all.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,666
[ISHIDA]
Tokugawa will what?

77
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,291
[OTANI] Not only did he
take the Taiko's life,

78
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,458
he means to bend
the Taiko's exploits

79
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,000
to his own duplicitous ends.

80
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,041
What? Damn him.

00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,750

Ieyasu!

82
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,708
You are a villain and
you will die like one!

83
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:39,583
[OTANI giggles] Even now,
Ieyasu grows more powerful.

84
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,291
Absorbing the broken Hojo,

85
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,000
and speaking mild words of
friendship all the while.

86
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,500
[ISHIDA]
He, a man who slew his master,

87
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,875
dares to adopt the
guise of peace?

88
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,375
[growls]

89
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,791
[ISHIDA]
Victory is ours.

90
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,250
[TOKUGAWA] You wage war
like a man possessed.

00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,666
[chuckles]

92
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,833
[TOKUGAWA] Fighting with
such unchecked zeal

93
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,166
is a good way to end
up dead, my friend.

94
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,750
[ISHIDA]
I care nothing for my own skin.

95
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:12,166
I believe in Lord Hideyoshi's
grand conquest. Do you not?

96
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,500
[TOKUGAWA] I believe in the
unified nation he pursues.

97
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,708
And...

98
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,791
[ISHIDA]
Damn you!

99
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,041
In the friendship I
have forged with him.

100
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,750
[ISHIDA]
You liar!

101
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,666
I'll cut that false
tongue out of your head!

[panting]

103
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,750
[ISHIDA]
Toyotomi's noble blood.

104
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,208
It is on my hands.

105
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,083
Why did I fall for
Ieyasu's honeyed words?

106
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,000
Lord Hideyoshi.

107
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,125
Lord Hanbei.

108
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,250
Know that, if only
I had the power,

109
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,958
I would kill even the
memory of that dark day!

110
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,541
[OTANI]
Mitsunari.

111
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,416
[OTANI]
The Taiko's betrayal and death

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,958
murdered you in all
ways but the flesh.

113
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:11,041
To think, that further
suffering may await you.

114
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,333
I deem it, a grave injustice.

115
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,125
[ISHIDA]
Lord Hideyoshi.

116
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,333
[TOKUGAWA]
Lord Shingen. I have come.

117
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,041
As a young man,
you defeated me on this field.

118
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,500
Taught me a great deal.

119
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,666
Time to show you how much.

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,416
[SAKAI] Fitting that fate
has brought you back here

121
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,541
to Mikata-gahara,
where you weathered such loss.

122
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,041
I always knew this
day would come.

123
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,666
[TOKUGAWA] Remember, our goal
isn't to crush the Takeda.

124
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,583
If we do this right, I think we
can convince them to join us.

125
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:57,916
Lord Shingen, today I will
teach you of something!

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,750
The strength of the bonds
that I have forged!

127
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:08,333
[shouts]

128
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,833
Looks like he's here.

[TAKEDA SOLDIER 2A]
Commander.

130
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,166
Word comes that
Tokugawa Ieyasu's

131
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,583
forces have invaded our
land at Mikata-gahara!

132
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,583
[SANADA]
They what?

133
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,083
Your Lordship!

134
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,583
There is no time to waste.

135
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
Impossible!

136
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,333
[TAKEDA]
Ieyasu awaits us.

137
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,083
[SANADA] Yes, but,
the messenger only just arrived!

138
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,625
Upon the wind. I smell
the soul of a rival tiger.

139
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,916
[KATAKURA]
They dog our every step.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,875
And this terrain grows
less familiar by the hour.

141
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,458
Wha-? Another ambush, sir?

142
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,541
Hardly. Would that it were.

143
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,666
Our pursuers have
harried us into lands

144
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,875
belonging to the
War God of Echigo himself.

145
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,958
Uesugi will brook no trespass.

146
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,458
[UESUGI] You have entered
my hallowed abode.

147
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,791
But I fear you will find no
succor here, defeated dragon.

148
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,333
[grunts]

149
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,500
[TAKEDA] Quite a sight.
His army cuts a fine figure.

150
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,416
Glad I came to visit
when I did, Shingen.

151
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,416
This young buck done laid
out a banquet for me!

152
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,666
Happy huntin', yeah?

153
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,875
[TAKEDA]
We'll meet again someday.

154
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,250
Till then.

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,708
[TAKEDA grunting]

156
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,541
[grunts]
War God of Echigo!

157
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,416
We intrude upon your
land in extremis!

158
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,000
We were driven here
at the barrel of a gun!

159
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,958
I beg of you!

160
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,208
Forgive this act we
had no mind to commit!

161
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,916
Forgiveness?

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,125
You ask for the one scruple none
can afford in these bloody days.

163
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,166
Are you a holy man or
a warrior, Katakura?

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,541
Ha. You were right
to shame me thus.

165
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,083
To think that the
Right Eye of the Dragon,

166
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,916
would sully his
master with such talk!

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All I want, is to wash away
this stain with death!

168
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,416
[UESUGI] And that would
atone for your cowardice?

169
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,041
[KATAKURA]
No, of course not.

170
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,458
Only valor in battle
can right that wrong!

171
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,291
That's why, Uesugi Kenshin,

172
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,041
to preserve my men,
I will beat you!

173
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,291
[SOLDIERS yelling]

174
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,541
Sanada Genjiro Yukimura
defends these lands!

[grunting]

176
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:05,916
Master.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,291
Would it kill you to
give me a heads-up

178
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,083
before you go charging in?

179

[grunting]

180
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,250
It would seem that
the Tokugawa soldiers

181
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,916
are as fierce as their lord.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,083
[SARUTOBI]
Fair enough.

183
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,625
Kinda makes me wonder, though.

184
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,583
How come our men
aren't stepping up?

185
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,666
[whistling]

186
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
[SARUTOBI]
What the?

00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,000
Yellow flares herald
an emergency!

Sasuke! Fight on without me!

191
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,083
I shall return!

[grunts]

194
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,875
[KATAKURA grunts]
He stands as though at ease,

195
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,916
but every fiber of his
being is poised to strike.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,791
I have but once chance.

197
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,791
[KATAKURA]
Princess Kaguya!

198
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,083
Coveted by many.

199
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,791
Caught by none!

It seems the Right Eye of
the Dragon has blinked.

203
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,125
[KATAKURA]
What?

204
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,166
[KATAKURA groans]

[SANADA]
Your Lordship!

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,208
I came as quickly as I could!

Your moniker is an
apt one, War God.

212
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,541
Before you end my life,
grant me this boon.

213
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,958
If I, Katakura Kojuro,

214
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,541
might buy the Date Army's
freedom by the loss of my head,

215
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,666
then take it!

00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,833
[UESUGI] Death is a
solace you do not deserve.

218
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,208
In this moment,
you are neither retainer,

219
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,375
nor general, nor man.

220
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,625
All I see here are
soldiers without a leader.

221
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,541
There is no honor
in fighting you.

C'mon, men! Hang in there!

225
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,458
You don't want Master Sanada
to have all the fun!

Oh, great!

This is not your fight!
