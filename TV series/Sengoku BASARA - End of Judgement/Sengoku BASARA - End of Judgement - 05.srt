that someone like
you'd follow 'is lead?

322
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,875
Mopey son-of-a-bitch
is honest to a fault!

323
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,875
He wants to beat that
Ieyasu bastard to a pulp!

324
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,333
Just like I do!

325
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,541
[SHIMAZU]
Oh yeah?

326
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,666
[CHOSOKABE] All us
sons-of-bitches with Ishida

327
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,250
got the same goal!

328
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,791
I hear even Sanada Yukimura of
the Takeda wants Ieyasu's head!

329
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,166
Really? The Tiger's
young cub, too?

330
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,458
Hold up. You tellin'
me you know Sanada?

331
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,000
Sounds like things're shapin' up
to get real hairy in the middle.

332
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,125
Awright! I believe
I will take yer side!

333
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,000
Whuh?

334
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,291
I smell a big ol' war a-brewin'.

335
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,416
This oughtta be my
chance to settle things

336
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,958
with the greatest damn
warrior from out west.

337
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,958
We'll fight fer who gets
to be "Ogre" after the war!

339
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:28,291
Gotta say. You're awful
spry for a guy your age.

340
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,541
[NARRATOR]
Around that time.

341
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,291
Otomo Sorin, who boasts
great power in Kyushu,

342
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,041
saw flocking to him
many believers of Xavism,

343
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,375
a mysterious religion that
had swept across the land.

344
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,833
[TACHIBANA]
Lord Mori.

345
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,500
We appreciate you taking the
trouble to come all this--

346
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,583
Ah, wonderful!

347
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
I have longed to
meet you, Tactician!

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,458
No, wait. Sunday!

349
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,708
I... "Sunday?" "Tactician?"

350
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,625
It can't be.

351
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,583
You're suffering amnesia!

352
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,291
[gasps] What a dramatic and
unfortunate turn of events!

353
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,625
Of what do you speak, young sir?

354
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,833
Yes, of course, this is simply
Lord Xavi's way of testing me.

355
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,666
I see, Lord.
You're telling me this time,

356
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,583
I must bring Sunday
into the fold myself!

357
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,791
Oh! We'll have Lord
Xavi in the center.

358
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,833
Sunday!

359
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,625
Chesty!

360
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,416
Joshy!

361
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And, of course.

362
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,708
There's me!

363
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,916
[chuckles]
Oh, how dreamy this'll be!

364
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:25,375
[OTOMO]
Oh! Lord Xavi!

365
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,208
[TACHIBANA] Great. Now this
guy is looking at us

366
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,916
like we're totally crazy
town banana pants.

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,208
[MORI]
We are done talking.

368
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,041
My heart is
passionately urging me

369
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,458
not to stay a single
moment longer.

370
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,375
Farewell.

371
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,125
[OTOMO]
Just watch, Lord Xavi.

372
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,375
I shall overcome this test!

373
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,166
[NARRATOR]
Having left Satsuma,

374
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
Chosokabe Motochika moved on.

375
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,750
Next on his list
was Kuroda Kanbei.

376
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,541
Awright, I'll just
get to the point.

377
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,166
Kuroda Kanbei, will you join
sides with Ishida Mitsunari?

378
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,458
[KURODA]
Ishida, you say?

379
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,666
[CHOSOKABE]
Yeah, And Otani, too.

380
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,750
Mitsunari? And Gyobu?

381
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,208
Hell no!

382
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,833
A request coming
from the bastards

383
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,833
who stuffed my humble
self in to this hole?

384
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,208
I'll never do it!

385
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,833
Well now. No one saw fit
to mention this to me.

386
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,333
Bastards sent me full sail into
a hell of a mess on this voyage.

387
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,666
Take a look at
this damn thing!

388
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,166
Ever since this got put on,

389
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,500
my humble self's luck has
gotten worse and worse!

390
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,166
I may not look it,
but back in the day,

391
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,541
I was hailed as the clever one
of Toyotomi's two strategists!

392
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,666
But that Gyobu bastard
got jealous and...

393
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,958
Anyway, I refuse to
do anything they want!

394
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,333
If you want to ask my
humble self for something,

395
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,375
bring me the damn key
to these damn shackles!

396
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,875
The key? Does Otani
have it or what?

397
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,083
Gyobu told me that he
dropped it during battle!

398
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,333
What the hell?

399
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,208
Can't you be more
responsible keeping track

400
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
of things like this?

401
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,583
Sounds like you've
been through a lot, too.

402
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,375
You really understand?

403
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,666
You seem like a stand up guy!

404
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,166
I have an idea!

405
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,916
I know someone who might help
us find where the key is.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,541
You do? Who's that?

407
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,208
Leggy lil' lass who's
good at divinations.

408
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,791
Hang with me, and I bet
she'll be the one to find us.

409
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,083
So, yeah?

410
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,416
You wanna join forces
with me and find a clue?

411
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,041
[growls] Those bastards
really tick me off, but,

412
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,500
This'll be for the key to
these shackles! All right!

413
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,041
I'll join you!

414
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,750
[TOKUGAWA] I take it that
your coming here means

415
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,000
that you have decided to
become allies with me,
