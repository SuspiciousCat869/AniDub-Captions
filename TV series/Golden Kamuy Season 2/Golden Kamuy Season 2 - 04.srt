hand Shiraishi over instead.

476
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,000
[dog barking]

477
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,250
The insignia number
on the jackets of the men

478
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,875
who took Shiraishi was 27.

479
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,750
That's one of the four
infantry regiments at Asahikawa.

480
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,750
The 27th infantry regiment.

481
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,791
This is their barracks,
right here.

482
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:51,833
[OGATA]
Wait a second.

483
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,541
You said the 27th?

484
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,791
What is it, Ogata?

485
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,208
Wow, you guys are idiots.

486
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,916
[SUGIMOTO]
Oh. That's right.

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,666
Does that mean they're
in the same regiment as Tsurumi?

488
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,708
I'll just say,
it's incredibly likely

489
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,291
that the 27th is indeed

490
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,875
the regiment
that's hiding our man.

491
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,625
They happen to be led by
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa,

492
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,791
who is very much
under Tsurumi's control.

493
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,166
What? The warden of Abashiri
wants to meet me?

494
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,791
I wonder
what that could be about.

495
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,000
Why is this guy even here?

496
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,583
[gasps]

497
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,291
I am Shirosuke Inudou,
the warden of Abashiri Prison.

498
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,750
It's nice to meet you.

499
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,083
[gasps]

500
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,416
[shudders]

501
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,916
Inudou.

502
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,291
[NARRATOR]
Next time, "Inside the Belly."
