325
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,000
I never thought I would
hear that name again at my age.

326
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,458
It was the fourth year
of the Keiou era

327
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,208
when last we met, wasn't it?

328
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,875
[NAGAKURA]
Yes, that's right.

329
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,125
I gave up on the Shinsengumi
at that point.

330
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,000
But, Hijikata,

331
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,916
even if I had my disagreements
with Kondou,

332
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,458
everything I did
for Shinsengumi,

333
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,458
I did because of you.

334
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,500
What the hell's
gotten into you, Shinpachi?

335
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,666
Has old age finally
softened you up a bit?

336
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,041
[NAGAKURA] Brother, if you
hadn't protected me from Kondou,

337
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,708
I would've been forced
to commit seppuku so many times.

338
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,458
[HIJIKATA] You liked the ladies
a little too much,

339
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,708
as I remember.

340
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,083
[NAGAKURA]
What are you trying to say?

341
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,750
You're the one who taught me
that bad habit.

342
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,416
[HIJIKATA] We both did
a lot of stupid things.

343
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,125
We loved swords,
wandering, and women

344
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
more than anything else.

345
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,250
We were an awful lot alike.

346
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,625
[NAGAKURA]
Remember your nickname?

347
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,541
I can't believe I'm thinking
of that right now,

348
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,833
but it was Baragaki,
"a kid as violent as a thorn."

349
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,375
What a stupid name.

350
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,250
[HIJIKATA] Oh? It's a damn sight
better than "Gamushin"

351
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,250
or "Reckless Shinpachi."

352
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,666
You were dumb
and a pain in the ass,

353
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,750
but when you swung your sword,
it was a thing of beauty.

354
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,041
And beautiful things
should live.

355
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,333
So you said.

356
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
When we had
that last horrible fight

357
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,291
before we parted ways,

358
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,958
was that actually
you trying to keep me

359
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,250
from following you
to your death?

360
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,666
I've spent countless nights
lying awake asking myself that.

361
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,500
Wondering if that was
the last thing

362
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,083
all of you did for me
to keep me safe.

363
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,791
Am I wrong, Hijikata?!

364
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,625
You are.

365
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,458
I just didn't like you
because you were an idiot.

366
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,250
[sobbing quietly]

367
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, Asirpa.

368
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you sure we haven't seen
Hijikata somewhere?

369
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,625
I feel positive
I've seen that face before.

370
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,708
Hmm?

371
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,041
[snoring]

372
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,333
[rustling]

373
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,458
[SUGIMOTO]
Oh, it's just an Ogata.

374
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,041
[KIRORANKE] There are
fake tattoos out there.

375
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,333
Going to Yuubari gave us
this valuable information.

376
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,041
That was a big miscalculation
on Lieutenant Tsurumi's part.

377
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,375
He probably didn't expect us
to find out quite so soon.

378
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,916
[HAJIME]
I'm sorry, lieutenant.

379
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,291
I'm afraid they escaped.

380
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,666
It's fine.

381
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,625
At the end of the day,
it really doesn't matter

382
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,333
whether or not they know
the fakes exist.

383
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,208
I only wanted one thing,
and I got it.

384
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,416
Chaos.

385
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,916
As long as we can keep gathering
the real skins one by one,

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,041
that's all we actually need.

387
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,000
Won't it be fun to watch them
run around helplessly,

388
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,375
uncertain of what's real
and what's not, Tsukishima?

389
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,791
Yes, sir.

390
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,541
[snickers]

391
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,916
Without any surefire way to tell
which ones are the fakes,

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,583
gathering the skins
will not be enough

393
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,458
to help us crack that code.

394
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,458
There may be no obvious way
to tell the difference at all.

395
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,291
[NAGAKURA] Well, that would be
quite a disappointment,

396
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,083
wouldn't it?

397
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,833
I suppose we'll have to try
to rely on this man.

398
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,541
Uh, who, me?

399
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,791
Never would've thought
that this useless idiot

400
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,000
would one day
be our last hope.

401
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,583
The fastest way forward
is to talk to Nopperabo

402
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,291
in Abashiri Prison directly.

403
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,916
It's up to you to get us in,
Escape King,

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,208
Pee break!

[footsteps approaching]

[SUGIMOTO]
Shiraishi.

407
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,208
Huh?

408
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,208
[SHIRAISHI laughing]

409
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,125
Good to see you, Sugimoto.

410
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,833
How were you able to find us?

411
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,083
Forget that.

412
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,791
We need to talk.

413
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,375
-Come with me.
-Uh...

414
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,500
[SHIRAISHI]
Where's everybody else?

415
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,250
[SUGIMOTO]
I remembered something.

416
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,208
[SHIRAISHI]
Oh, yeah?

417
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,000
[SUGIMOTO]
After Kazuo Henmi died,

418
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,875
we met a weird guy
at the longhouse, remember?

419
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,333
It was Toshizou Hijikata.
I'm sure of it.

420
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,958
[gasps]

421
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,791
[SUGIMOTO] So, I guess,
you were working with him then?

422
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,708
You were passing him
information about us

423
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,000
the whole time, weren't you?

424
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,500
[gasps]
No.

425
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,583
Man, I was super drunk
at the longhouse.

426
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,125
[SUGIMOTO] Are you really
still gonna lie to me?

427
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,333
If you'd told the truth,
I would've forgiven you.

[SHIRAISHI]
Oh, jeez. What do I do?

436
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,208
Now I'm scared shitless.

437
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,208
The gold won't matter
if he kills me first.
