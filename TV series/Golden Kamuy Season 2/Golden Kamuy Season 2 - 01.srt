I'm very sorry.

480
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,791
[TANIGAKI]
Who are you?

481
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,416
I'm no one, but I'm here
in search of someone.

482
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,375
I wonder if you could
help me with that.

483
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,708
I'm looking for a girl
with blue eyes.

484
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,750
My Sirakki Kamuy says
this is the right place.

485
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,625
We met in Naganuma.

486
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,625
She said she was traveling
with a goal in mind.

487
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,625
She had three Nispa with her.

488
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,833
[speaking Ainu]

489
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,041
And one of them is going
to betray little Asirpa.

490
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,250
[continues speaking Ainu]

491
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,916
[INKARMAT]
He's a very dangerous man.

492
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,541
If he's not stopped,

493
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,250
her life may very well
be in grave danger.

494
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,333
[MAKANAKKURU speaking Ainu]

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,791
[TANIGAKI]
I'll bring Asirpa back safely.

496
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,166
I promise.

497
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,000
Osoma, your turn.

498
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,166
Isn't there something
you want to give him?

499
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,375
[sobbing]

500
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,208
[MAKANAKKURU]
She spent a long time

501
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,583
trying to make you tekunpe,
with Huci's help.

502
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,166
She only managed to get
one done in time, though.

503
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,875
When an Ainu woman's in love,

504
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,791
she makes a pair of tekunpe
to give her man.

505
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,250
Thank you, Osoma.

506
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,916
I promise I'll come back,

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,916
so you better make me
the other one.

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,916
Mm-hmm.

509
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,791
[speaking Ainu]

510
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,208
Shall I tell your fortune?

511
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,708
It could help you find Asirpa.

512
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,833
No, don't bother.

513
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,375
I'm not going because I believe
in your fortune-telling.

514
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,541
The problem is, you seem
to have the villagers convinced.

515
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,208
The Sirakki Kamuy tells me

516
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,583
that good fortune
lies to the east.

517
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,958
Let's be off, Tanigaki Nispa.

518
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,958
Wait. Why are you
coming with me?

519
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,666
I already told you.

520
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,750
I have a weakness for a man
with a scar on his face.

521
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,458
[TSURUMI]
Hmm. I see.

522
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,500
Use the man named Tanigaki

523
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,916
who's staying with the Ainu
at the kotan.

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,708
With any luck, I think his leg
should have healed by now.

525
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,458
[NARRATOR]
Next time: "Fakes"
