[PARN] Don't become a man

00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,583
that's given to him.

00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,416
[SPARK] It's my decision
to make this journey.

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,833
I swear I'll recover the
two keys. And also...

I will protect you.

[SPARK]
We finally made it to Kanon...

Isn't it great to have real

You gotta love this land.

[NEESE]
Huh?

00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,000
[ALDO] You shouldn't let

[NEESE] Ah... Ah!
It's all right, Aldanova!

23
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,083
I don't mind getting
a little wet.

"You should let your

[LEAF growls]

29

In that case, you may
travel as far as Kanon

30
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,833
aboard one of our
military ships.

May the gods of Light watch
over and protect you.

[SPARK] I shall be grateful
to you forever, King Etoh.

00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,083
[GARRACK]
Okay?

34
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,666
[SPARK]
Huh?

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,416
[GARRACK] What're we going to do
now that we're here, Captain?

36
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,208
Is there a need to ask?

37
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,708
We make our way through
Kanon and head straight

38
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,208
for the island of Marmo.

39
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,458
[RYNA moans]
This breeze feels good...

40
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,875
Kinda tingles, doesn't it, Ryna?

41
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,625
The air in Kanon has a
character all its own.

42
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,875
Kanon is a fertile land
of lush greenery.

43
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,625
It's prevailing winds come
from a different direction

44
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,000
than the desert winds of Flaim.

45
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,833
[GARRACK]
A different direction, eh?

46
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:50,583
So, do you think this new wind
will blow some luck our way?

47
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,250
We sure could use a little.

48
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,708
But I think if we keep heading
east, we should be okay.

49
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,625
[NEESE] This path will
take us straight to Roodo.

50
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,541
They'll head that way, too.

51
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,750
Whoever has the crystal ball
and the Staff of Life,

52
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,458
they'll have to find a major
port if they're going to make

53
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,541
the crossing into Marmo.

54
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,750
I agree. Roodo is
the most likely place

55
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,958
for us to find a way
to Marmo as well.

56
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:19,958
Hold on. Remember what King Etoh
said about Kanon's free army.

57
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,666
If they can help us,
then we should find them.

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,708
He's right. The free army is
our only ally here in Kanon.

59
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,583
They've probably got the latest
information on the Marmo.

60
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:35,458
Perhaps, but we must get to
Roodo as quickly as we can...

61
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,833
...and finish the job
we came here to do.

but did you really have
to pick this road?!

65
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,291
The Marmo army could never
travel on a road like this.

66
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,666
It may not be the easiest

The Kanon free army?!

320
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,458
Hold it! You're wrong!
We aren't Marmo!

321
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,541
Wait.

322
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,541
We're all from Flaim, and
we've just come from Valis.

323
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,791
Don't try to trick me!

324
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,000
[SPARK]
But it's not a trick! It's true!

325
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm carrying a letter from
King Etoh! I'll show it to you!

326
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,500
[VOICE]
A letter from King Etoh?

327
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,708
[gasps]

328
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,458
I got to see this for myself.

329
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:45,291
[gasps] Can it really be?!
The free knight... Parn!

330
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,416
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

331
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

332
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,833
the second part!

333
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,291
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

334
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,916
[SPARK] All right! I can't
believe how lucky we were

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,333
to find this totally
happening beach!

336
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,083
I just love the summer
time at the beach!

337
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,458
Now I can relax
and have fun! Yup!

338
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,583
[NEESE]
Spark! Spark! Come on in!

339
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,750
The water feels great! [giggles]

340
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,958
[LITTLE DRAGON squawks]

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,666
Huh?

342
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,583
[giggles]

343
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,125
Huh...? [screams]

344
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,833
[screams]

345
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,500
[NEESE] Help, Spark!
It's a freakin' shark!

346
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,916
Hang on, Neese!
I'm a knight in training

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,500
and it's my duty to protect you!

348
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,875
Uh-oh... This is not
a sword... Wahh...

349
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,666
Help! Do something,
you freakin' sissy!

350
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,750
No! Ma... ma...!

351
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,541
[BOTH grunting]

352
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,958
Ow...

353
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,000
Brave knight my ass.

354
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,041
Huh...?

355
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,166
Don't look, Neese...

356
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,291
Huh?

357
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,541
[shrieks]

358
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,916
That's no shark!

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,958
Yeah! That makes Jaws look cute!

360
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:17,541
[LITTLE DRAONG squawks]

361
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,041
[VOICE]
Ouch.

362
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,375
Thatta boy!

363
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,208
[PARN]
Hey, wait a second!

364
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,083
[NEESE]
Huh?

365
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,458
Long time no see, Spark!

366
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:32,708
[SPARK] Agh! It's an old
pervert! Run away! Run away!

367
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,583
I just wanted to give
him the magic sword...

368
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:41,458
That's why I've been swimming
around for so long...

369
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,791
He said I'm old...

370
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,625
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seeing you!

371
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,750
[NEESE]
Amid the hardship of battle,

372
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,625
we take a moment's
rest at a banquet

373
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,666
in the fortress
of the free army.

374
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,833
Here, I can finally relax.

375
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,833
I know I shouldn't
get used to this,

376
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,291
but, oh, how I wish
it would last.

377
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,541
This peaceful night
with Spark...

378
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,500
Next time, on
