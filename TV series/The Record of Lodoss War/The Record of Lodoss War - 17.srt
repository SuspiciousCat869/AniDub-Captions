[NARRATOR]
Lodoss now stands divided,

2
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,250
controlled by
three major forces:

3
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,583
The Alanian-Marmo alliance,

4
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,583
the Lodoss Federation
of Valis and Flaim,

5
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,375
and the Kingdom of Moss,

6
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,458
which continues to be
absorbed by civil war.

7
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,958
But the war in Moss
is nearing its end.

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,083
[NARRATOR] Under the
command of Duke Redrick

9
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,166
of the Ducy of Highland
and Queen Shiris,

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,541
the dragon riders are
close to completing

11
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,208
the long-awaited
reunification of Moss.

12
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,083
[NARRATOR]
At the same time,

13
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,625
in the Alanian
village of Novice,

14
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,291
the forces of Flaim led by
King Kashue are engaging

15
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,166
the Alanian forcers under
the command of Duke Raster.

16
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,375
[NARRATOR]
The war has begun.

[yelling]

18
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,208
[ALIAN ADVISER A]
Our men are overpowering

19
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,458
the so-called elite
forces from Flaim.

20
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,083
Because we knew that
Prince Robess was asking

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,041
Flaim for reinforcements,

22
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,166
Kashue's attack was
easy to predict.

23
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,041
[ALIAN ADVISER A]
Launching a surprise attack

24
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,583
was the smartest decision
of all, my lord.

25
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,958
Ahh. Once I defeat Kashue
and take Flaim as my own,

26
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,125
then all of Lodoss will
certainly line up.

27
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,375
How did this happen?!

28
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,333
This is my fault, Your Highness.

29
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,375
The attack force was made up
mostly of young knights.

30
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,541
Most had never been
in battle before...

31
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,500
[SHADAM]
They were too hungry for glory,

32
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,458
so much so they
didn't think about

33
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,708
the experience of the enemy.

34
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,791
The results are most obvious.

35
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,583
We can't allow our own men
to strengthen the enemy.

36
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,833
Move our mercenary division up
and engage their front line.

37
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,250
The rest will follow me and hit
their main forces from behind!

38
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,000
[SHADAM] You're going after
the duke by your, Highness?

Duke Raster's head is mine.

what it's like to
fight a professional.

[NARRATOR] With Raster fleeing,
the Alanian troops

00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,500
were no match for
the forces of Flaim.

74
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,083
The tyrannical Raster
took his remaining forces

back to the capital, and using
its citizens as human shields,

Kashue and his army have
completely surrounded Alan.

The king has dispatched
a messenger

offering Raster the terms
of his surrender.

I take it the negotiations have
not gone very well, Slayn.

No, he insists the only
way he'll surrender

is if we return to Flaim.

91

Raster's crazy if he thinks
we'll ever agree to that.

No. No, I'm fine.

He looks like he's all right.

We were worried about you.

114
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,125
Garrack was so nervous he
kept pacing around the room

115
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,333
and we couldn't calm
him down for anything.

116

Aw, come on, Leaf.
He doesn't have to hear that.

I'm just relieved you actually
made it back in time.

118
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,541
We all thought you were
going to miss the banquet,

119
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,291
and we were about
ready to panic.

I'm sorry, everyone.

Hey, Spark. What happened?

00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:30,375
Well, after we all split up,
I ran into the strangest man.

You care about them.
That's good.

My name is Jay.

125
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,708
And if you feel like it, come by
the bridge with your friends

00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,083
after the moon rises this night.

I'll take you to Kanon.

[gasps]

129
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,583
And when you get there,
then you can become

130
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,375
mercenaries for the Marmo.

131
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,083
Must you leave tonight?

132
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,208
[JAY] Yeah, tonight.
Tomorrow's too late.

I'll be waiting
for you... friend...

134
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,875
[GARRACK] And you think this
guy is for real, Captain?

00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,416
[SPARK] There's absolutely
no question about it.

136

If a Marmo ship actually
made it here...

137
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,083
...it would have to
be a military ship.

138
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,125
It must be in port posing
as a free trader.

139
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,291
But for what purpose?

140
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,708
To transport their bag

Yeah, you're right! When you
really think about it,

143
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,708
this has to be the clue we've
all been chasing after.

[GARRACK growls]

145
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,375
A military ship just
for that? I don't buy it.

00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,333
You think there's some
other reason for it?

147
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,583
You only use a military
ship for one thing.

148
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:45,000
If you ask me, I think
they're going to attack.

Are you nuts?!
There's no way they would.

150
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,791
They wouldn't dare attack the
temple of Falis, would they?

151
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,833
Of course! The Marmo would
try to attack the temple

152
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,958
to steal the Staff of Life!

153
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,333
Garrack, I think
I agree with you!

154
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,208
We'd better tell
King Etoh right away!

155
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:01,666
[SPARK]
Wait.

But Spark!

157

[SPARK] If we tell King
Etoh what we think,

158

then he'll know we've
been snooping around

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,500
right under his nose.

160
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,666
He'll never trust what we say.

161
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,583
Besides, a Marmo attack
is only one possibility

162
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,208
out of who knows how many.

163
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,291
If we're wrong
about this, then...

164
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,666
But if we're right about
this, Spark, then what?

165
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,041
[door creaks]

166
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:26,583
Huh?

167
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,000
[SPARK]
Uh?

168
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,750
Hi. What's everyone been up to?

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,625
[ALDO] ...and as I said, most of
this is a guess on our part.

170
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,625
But it all seems to fit.

171
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,083
[LEAF] Still, the guy did say he
just wants to take mercenaries

172
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,375
who want to work for
the Marmo to Kanon.

173
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,666
[NEESE] Mm. But your theory
about a Marmo attack...

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,750
I think it might be true.

175
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,958
Don't you think we should
inform King Etoh about this?

176
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,958
That's exactly what I said, too.

177
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,208
And now the captain's like...
Well, look at him!

178
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:08,000
I just don't get it. Why is he
so torn up over this?

179
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,416
Oh! Sorry, Captain.

180
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
Uh, Captain?

181
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
[SPARK]
I've gotta go.

182
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,500
[GREEVUS]
He's lost his way.

183
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,916
[NEESE]
Uh? Lost his way?

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,875
No, maybe that's not the best
way to describe it, Neese.

185
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,708
I think he's overwhelmed
and no longer knows

186
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,666
what he's supposed to do.

187
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,375
But that doesn't make any sense.

188
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,250
[GARRACK] It doesn't matter.
King Kashue ordered us to stop

189
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,416
looking for the Soul Crystal
Ball and to return to Flaim.

190
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Which means that what we did

191
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,583
was a direct violation
of those orders.

192
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,041
But those orders came
from King Kashue.

193
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,416
King Etoh had nothing to do with
them, so what's the big deal?

194
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,791
Think about, Leaf. We're a bunch
of foreigners messing around

195
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,500
like this place was our home.

196
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,416
So Spark is afraid that
what he did might damage

197
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,750
the relationship between
Valis and Flaim in some way.

198
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,291
And if Flaim and Valis
were to break ranks now...

199
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,875
...then neither would stand a
chance against Marmo and Alania.

200
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,458
And we didn't get any real
proof of an impending attack.

201
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,791
I bet Spark feels like
a total failure for that.

202
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,000
You're right, Garrack... It
seems there are a lot of things

203
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
that go into becoming a knight.

204
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,125
It's not at all like
being a mercenary.

205
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,416
[SPARK yelling]

206
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,500
[pants]

207
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,000
[LEAF]
All I can say is

208
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,833
I wouldn't wanna be
Spark right now.

209
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,375
[ALDO] This, too, is a part
of his training, Leaf.

210
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,208
All we can do is wait
until he makes a decision.

211
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,125
[GARRACK]
A decision a knight would make.

212
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,750
A knight would make...

213
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,708
[SPARK yelling, grunting]

214
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,375
[NEESE] Spark. Shouldn't
you rest a little?

215
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,125
[NEESE] Thrashing your
sword around when you're

216
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,958
confused like this isn't
really training, is it?

217
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:28,916
You should try to think about
what's most important instead.

218
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,375
If you do that, I'm certain
the answer will come to you.

219
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,833
But I am thinking!

220
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:42,125
I keep thinking and I still
don't know what to do!

221
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,958
[NEESE] The people's lives--no,
the entire future of Lodoss

222
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,541
may be riding on your decision.

223
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,875
[SPARK]
Don't you think I know that?!

224
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,750
But if I make the wrong choice,
then Flaim and Valis might--

225
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,291
In the long run, does that
really matter, Spark?

226
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,333
Neese! You have no idea what
it means to be a knight!

227
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,375
You're a cleric, and your
choices are already defined!

228
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:09,916
Not so for me! As a knight, it's
all about duty and my kingdom

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,958
and honor and... and it's
all very complicated!

230
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,750
Very well, then. I have
nothing else to say.

231
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:24,625
You are free to do
as you see fit.

232
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,041
Good luck, Spark.

233
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,416
[SPARK] Dammit! Why is
everything so simple

234
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,875
and straightforward with her?!

235
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,583
Doesn't she understand
what I'm going through?!

236
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,041

Please report to the great hall.

00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,458
It's Spark.

243
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,083
Well, we have to go.

244
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,083
We don't want King Etoh
to be suspicious of us.

[ALL sigh]

246
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,916
Ah, wasn't Lady Neese
with you, Spark?

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,708
I thought she came back
in here a few minutes ago.

248
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,541
No, she didn't come back.

249
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,833
Great, now we've gotta
go to this banquet

250
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,250
and Neese isn't here.

251
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,166
Where do you suppose she's gone?

252
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,125
No! She couldn't have!
Do you think she's gone

253
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,041
to the temple of
Falis by herself?!

254
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,958
[SPARK]
But why would she?

255
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,208
[ALDO] Have you forgotten
the reason Lady Neese

256
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,291
came to Valis in the first
place?! The second key!

257
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,416
The Staff of Life!
It's in the temple of Falis!

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,833
But how in the world...?

259
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,375
She could never protect
it from the Marmo!

260
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,666
So she decided
to go by herself?!

261
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,541
That's absolutely insane!

262
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,250
If they steal the Staff of Life,

263
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,125
they'll come after
he next anyway!

264
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,416
Why would she tempt fate

265
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,375
and put herself in
that kind of danger?!

266
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,875
[ALDO] You're wrong.
Lady Neese went because

267
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,875
she knew. She knew she
had to face them.

268
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,416
She has to fight against
her cursed destiny

269
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
of being the Doorway!

270
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,333
[SPARK]
That's right! Neese...

271
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,166
[SPARK]
She's been fighting all along.

272
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,041
Fighting to stop the Destroyer's
resurrection all by herself.

273
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,583
You should try to think about
what's most important instead.

274
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,916
If you do that, I'm certain
the answer will come to you.

[SPARK] And despite that...
Despite that... I...

King Etoh is in the
great hall, right?!

00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,708
Uh, yes, sir!

279
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,916
[GREEVUS] Well, that's better.
At least it seems he knows

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,375
what he needs to do now.

281
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,291
I wonder what King Kashue
will say about this.

282
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,208
He'll probably be happy.

What was I so confused about?!

285
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,208
I'd been so concerned about my
duty and how things appear,

286
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,125
that I forgot about
what's most important.

287
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,125
I swore that I would protect
Neese above anything else.

288
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,083
But despite that, I...

289
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,000
What's most important now
is to protect Neese

290
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,166
and secure the Staff of Life.

must not be reborn!

But, Your Highness,

there is something urgent
that I must discuss!

From the way you're acting,

297
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,250
can I assume that you won't be
joining me for dinner tonight?

300

[GARRACK]
Right.

301
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,500
[ETOH]
I understand, Spark.

302
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,125
We'd better take
immediate action.

303
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,541
Are you sure we should
believe him, Highness?

304
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,708
He could be spying
for the Marmo.

305
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,208
If I'm wrong, you can
lock me up in prison

for as long as you want!

00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,291
by the chaotic wave of war...

313
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,541
Neese!

314
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,916
[CROWD screaming]

315
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,416
[SPARK]
Neese! I'm coming!

316
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,583
Hey, you forgot
something, Captain!

317
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:24,458
Go now, Spark. I'll join you
soon with my royal guard forces.

318
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,041
[SPARK]
Thank you, Highness.

319
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,958
All right, let's go!

320
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,416
[SPARK]
Now I have no doubts!

321
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,958
The Staff of Life... and Neese.

322
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,791
I swear, I'll protect them both!

323
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,875
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss island!

324
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,000
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

325
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,500
the second part!

326
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,000
[DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

327
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,875
[DARK ELF chuckles]

328
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,666
[DARK ELF] Whoopty-doo,
whoopty-doo, doo-doo-doo!

329
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,375
Whoopty-doo!

330
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,250
So here's how the plan'll work.

331
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,625
Once they fall
into this here hole,

332
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,958
I'll be a stand-up guy
and offer to let 'em go...

333
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,041
... <i>if</i> they give me the cookies.

334
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,166
Naturally, I won't really
let 'em go. Ha!

335
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,916
Those cookies are
almost mine! Hey, ha!

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,833
[SPARK]
Pow-pow, Parn! Pow-pow, Parn!

337
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,958
See, you can't make a really
neat cheer outta my name...

338
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,583
[NEESE]
Big deal!

339
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,666
[DRAGON squawks]

340
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,458
A monster?!

341
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,000
That's Little Gargoyle,
Mama Dragon's messenger.

342
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,500
Let's see... Oh, my! Heh, heh.

343
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,000
Hey, Neese. You can read dragon?

344
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:02,666
Huh?

345
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,458
[DARK ELF chuckles]

346
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,458
I'll take care of that
there letter, little girl.

347
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,416
It's... the Dark Elf!

348
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,833
You bet, there.
Now what does here letter

349
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,750
tell me how to make
Neese's cookies?

350
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,000
Huh?!

351
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,750
You know, I coulda just
stolen 'em from youse.

352
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,291
Gimme back that note, you!

353
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,333
Bite me, cookie head!

354
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,041
[SPARK]
Come back here, you!

355
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,500
[DARK ELF]
Watch it, you!

356
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,166
[SPARK screams]

357
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
[DARK ELF]
Oof, ha!

358
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,791
[NEESE] Spark!
Where the hell did you go?!

359
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:35,125
This is no time for freakin'
games, Spark! I mean it! Spark!

360
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,458
[SPARK]
Neese! I'm down here!

361
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,708
No use... Now what do we do?

362
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,083
[DARK ELF groans]

363
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,916
We'll wait.

364
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,125
[SPARK, NEESE]
We'll be seeing you!

365
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,083
[SPARK]
The Marmo forces have landed

366
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,875
in the holy kingdom of Valis.

367
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,708
We race to the burning temple in
pursuit of our missing comrade.

368
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,208
Is the Staff of Life safe?
What about Neese?

369
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,083
The answers are to be found
within raging flames.
