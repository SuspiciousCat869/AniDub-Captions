1
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:12,875
Kardis, the time is near!
The keys are here!

2
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,708
Soon now...

3
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:19,291
Soon you will be released
from your eternal prison.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,166
Just wait, little Doorway...

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,041
[WAGNARD laughs]

6
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR] After reuniting with
Parn and the Kanon free army,

7
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,083
Spark and the others
accompanied them

8
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,125
to the army's hidden fortress.

9
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,458
There, Neese reveals her
cursed fate to Parn.

10
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:52,416
Now he, too, understands
the true peril at hand.

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,291
[PARN]
I'm so sorry, Neese.

12
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,000
Such hardship.

13
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,125
No, this is my destiny.

14
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,125
We know that Wagnard
already has the two keys

15
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,750
he needs to initiate the
resurrection of Kardis--

16
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,416
the Soul Crystal Ball
and the Staff of Life--

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,958
but I'd sooner die than
to let him have Neese!

18
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,125
[gasps]

19
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,875
We're all counting on you.

20
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,375
Yes, sir!

21
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,250
[PARN] I welcome you again,
knight in training Spark.

22
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,666
Or do you finally have
the formal title of knight?

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,250
Well, it's actually
just the opposite.

24
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,875
I've had my qualifications
as a knight revoked.

25
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,708
I see...

26
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,250
Well, relax a little.

27
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,416
Right.

28
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,416
You all look like you've
had a rough time.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,083
Please, come.

30
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,541
Oh, yes, ma'am!

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,916
"Oh, yes, ma'am..."

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,583
[LEAF]
What was that?!

33
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,833
Nothing.

34
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,208
Um, Sir Parn?

35
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,541
What is it?

36
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,125
If you wouldn't mind,
could you please update us

37
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,208
on the war situation?
We've been travelling on our own

38
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,708
for so long, we haven't
heard a thing.

39
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,000
I see. Not surprising.

40
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,500
Now then, you know about King
Kashue leading the army of Flaim

41
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,875
into the kingdom of
Alania, don't you?

42
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,000
[SPARK]
Yes, we know about that.

43
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,666
[PARN] Kashue's army defeated
the Alanian forces in

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,666
a terrible battle near Novice,
and now he's got them surrounded

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,375
in the capital city of Alan.

46
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,333
[NARRATOR] King Kashue,
trying to preserve Alan,

47
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,500
has repeatedly offered terms
of surrender to Duke Raster,

48
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,666
the self-appointed
leader of Alania.

49
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,291
However, Raster, has continually
refused to accept.

50
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,958
[RASTER wheezes, laughs]

51
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,583
[gasps] Kashue!

52
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,166
I warned you, didn't I?

53
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,375
I told you that if you
didn't want Alan to burn,

54
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,041
if you cared at all
about your citizens,

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,958
all you had to do...

56
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,708
...was surrender your
forces on my terms.

57
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,750
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

58
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,875
How many innocent people have
died because of your actions?!

59
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,708
The actions of a king!

60
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,250
A man who is supposed
to protect his subjects!

61
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,041
Unforgiveable!

[RASTER screams]

67
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:30,416
[NARRATOR] And so, Alan fell.
And with it, the rest of Alania.

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,458
Uniting the conquered
forces with his own,

69
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,625
Kashue turned his
complete attention

70
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,208
toward defeating the Marmo.

71
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,375
Meanwhile, upon learning
of Alania's defeat,

72
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,291
King Etoh of the
holy kingdom of Valis

73
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,083
decided to launch a
full-state counterattack

74
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,541
against the Marmo as well.

75
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,333
With Etoh's leadership and
power as the High Priest,

76
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,875
those faithful to
the god of Light

77
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,708
became holy warriors
unafraid of death,

78
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,375
as the holy magic
was brought to bay.

79
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,791
King Etoh declared war?

80
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,916
Yes. He's committed to
this with all his heart.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,791
And yet, the Marmo continue
to cause problems for us.

82
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,333
Damn them!

83
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,791
Just calm down, Spark! I've got
a plan and I need your help!

We fight! This is no time

Well said, Spark.

Now, let's go show
them our power.

110
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,208
Right.

Well done, Spark.

Thanks to you, our ambush
was a great success.

Don't thank me.

117
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,416
I know it doesn't seem like
much, but stealing supplies

118
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,791
like this really does the
enemy some damage over time.

119
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,208
Right.

120
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,166
[PARN] Anyway, now we're ready.
It's time for our forces

to head out and join
Prince Reona in Roodo.

The Marmo are almost finished.

So to give some meaning to all
this hard work you've done,

124
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,500
I thought you and your

I hope you'll be able
to stay for it.

Yes! We'd be honored, sir.

128

Well, later then.

Nice work, Parn.

Oh, Neese!

Look! They're all just fine!

132
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
And now I can relax...

You had doubts?!

134
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,416
Well, it doesn't look
like an easy time.

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,708
Even the Marmo aren't idiots.

136
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,583
After all those ambushes,
they're assigning more escorts.

just a scratch, Neese.

This is hardly just
a scratch, Spark.

I'll heal it for you.
Now go and get it washed out

Please, Neese. I'm telling you,
I'm all right.

I've got an idea, Neese. Why
don't you come and fix me up?

00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,916
Good idea. And Spark,
I'll heal you instead.

Can't you be a little sensitive?

150

Huh?!

151
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,666
A seed shouldn't be disturbed.

Now let's go get
that wound washed out.

How's that?

00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,000
How'd you do that?

163
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,916
[NEESE] Hmm? Oh...
Healing people is something

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,250
that comes naturally to me.

165
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,500
Anyway, I want to
help with banquet.

166
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,291
[SPARK]
Yes, I should get back, too.

167
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,833
[NEESE]
Let's go, then.

168
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,375
Right...

169
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,833
A banquet sure takes
a lot of work.

170
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,500
[LEAF]
Hey, Neese! How'd it go?

171
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,041
[NEESE]
How'd it go? What do you mean?

172
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,875
Come on, quit playin' dumb.

173
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,833
You got your chance to be
alone with Spark, didn't you?

174
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,166
Did you make your confession?

175
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,291
Your young maiden's confession?

176
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,958
Confession?

177
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,791
"Oh, my dear Spark,

178
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,458
I have always, always,
always loved you!"

179
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,041
"Oh, Neese. The truth is,
I've always loved you, too."

180
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,083
"Oh, Spark!"

181
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,625
"Oh, Neese!"

182
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,333
[BOTH sigh]

183
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,750
Leaf stop! Ryna, cut it out!

184
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,875
[GREEVUS]
Now Leaf, Ryna.

185
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,625
If you're not going to help us
to prepare for the banquet,

186
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,375
then please leave us alone.

187
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,958
[BOTH]
Sure...

188
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,708
Keep on peeling, Neese.

189
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,958
Right.

190
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,416
[GARRACK]
Hey, Captain Captain.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,375
What now?

192
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,375
So, how did it go with the girl?

193
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,125
What? Huh? What girl?

194
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,583
Don't play dumb with me. You
know I'm talking about Neese.

195
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,083
Neese?!

196
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,666
I just heard it from Leaf.

197
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,541
Just what I'd expect
from my captain.

198
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,458
You've stolen the heart
of that little priestess.

199
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,208
[gasps]

200
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,375
The granddaughter of Neese,
one of the Six Heroes?

201
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Man, what a score!

202
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,708
Garrack, I don't know what
you're talking about!

203
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,708
And at a time like this,
when you know that I've sworn

204
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,708
to protect her?!

205
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,666
[ALDO]
How dare you?!

206
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,000
[SPARK] Aldo! I didn't lay
a finger on her, honest!

207
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,125
Who said anything
about touching her?

208
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,291
I heard you two are in love

209
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,083
Now, look!

210
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,416
In love?!

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,833
[SPARK]
Listen to me!

212
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,500
So, what really happened between
you and Neese, Captain?

213
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,500
Leaf seems to think you two
had a nice time together

214
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,666
out in the woods.

215
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,583
What?

216
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,291
[SPARK grunts]

217
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,166
Just lay off!

218
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,125
[chatter, laughter]

219
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,916
[PARN chuckles]

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,791
Where are Ryna and Leaf?

221
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,041
I've got a bone
to pick with them.

222
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,875
They said they'd be along
any time now, Captain.

223
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,666
You should eat something.
This stuff is great! [belches]

224
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,375
No, thanks. I'm all right.

225
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,083
Oh, really?

226
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,750
Spark... When it's
time to eat, you eat.

227
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,666
You're right.

228
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
Now listen to the priest, Spark.

229
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,208
Tell me, Spark, how're
you enjoying yourself?

230
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,833
Ah. Fine.

231
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,083
Good. Today, we all eat,
drink, and make merry.

232
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,875
[LEAF] Captain!
Take a look at me, Spark!

233
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,750
[gasps]

234
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,916
Miss Deedlit! What a nice night!

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,833
Leaf, where have you been?
The banquet's already begun

236
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,125
and you're late!

237
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh, Captain! You've got
to learn to lighten up.

238
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
Ryna and I were very busy

239
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,333
getting dressed up
for the banquet.

240
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:30,375
Dressed up? Oh really? You don't
look any different to me.

241
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
[growls]

242
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,875
When you're as
beautiful as I am,

243
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,250
you don't really have to
dress up to look adorable.

244
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,291
Now, look, Leaf--

245
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,500
No, you need to look
at this! Ta-dah!

246
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,875
[SPARK gulps]

247
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,208
[GARRACK]
Oh...

248
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,291
I guess... I look pretty funny.

249
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,166
[LEAF] Neese looks pretty,
right? Come on, Captain,

250
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,083
this is a new look for her.
Give her a compliment.

251
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,000
--[GARRACK] Wow...
--Lady Neese, you're lovely...

252
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:03,041
[LEAF] I wasn't talking to you
guys. I meant the captain!

253
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:07,208
Ah! Um... You, um... look nice!

254
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,916
Why, thank you, Captain.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,250
Uh... Um... Uh.

256
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,000
Sure looks like love.

257
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,125
[PARN]
Mm...

258
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,541
Hey, Parn?

259
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,375
Uh...

260
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,916
We haven't danced in awhile.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,708
Hey, uh, Dee!

262
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:25,083
[DEEDLIT] Refusing an invitation
from a lady, Sir Free Knight?

263
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,166
[PARN chuckles]
I guess I have no choice.

264
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Heh. It would be my
pleasure... milady.

265
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:39,458
[music plays]

266
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,166
They're great...

267
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,208
Come on, Spark, don't just
watch. Ask Neese to dance.

268
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,875
[SPARK]
J-Just wait a minute, here!

269
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,291
It isn't proper to dance with--

270
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,916
Listen! When a girl
gets all dressed up,

271
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,333
it's a knight's duty
to dance with her!

272
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,000
Neese, you deserve
to have a little fun.

273
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,875
Yes.

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,958
Shall we?

275
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,291
Sure.

276
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,250
Oh, Lady Neese...

277
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,708
[SPARK] I don't know
what they want us to do.

278
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,166
I'm really sorry about
stepping on your foot

279
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
when we were dancing.

280
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,833
Oh... It's all right.
I had a wonderful time.

281
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,750
The most fun I've
ever had... I think...

282
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,583
...in my entire life.

283
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,125
[SPARK] In your entire life?
You can't be serious.

284
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,958
You see, Spark, ever
since I can remember,

285
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,583
my life has been
devoted to Marfa,

286
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,083
and I don't think the Earth
Goddess would approve

287
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,166
of her priestess having
fun with other people.

288
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,791
As a priestess, I must
be especially careful

289
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,541
to keep my heart pure.

290
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,125
And before, when we
were dancing, well...

291
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,416
I never felt that way before.

292
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,916
So, I imagine Marfa must
be very angry with me.

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,375
[SPARK]
I think you're wrong about that.

294
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,375
[gasps]

295
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,666
Having fun, being
happy and sad...

296
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,000
That's part of what it
means to be human, Neese.

297
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Even a priestess can't cut
herself off from other people.

298
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,708
It wouldn't be fair.

299
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,708
Ah! I... I'm sorry, Neese.
How can I say that

300
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,083
when I know nothing about you?

301
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
[NEESE] If you wanna
know the truth, Spark,

302
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,541
King Etoh told me the same thing
just before we left Valis.

303
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,375
He said I didn't have to
work so hard just because

304
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
I'm a priestess.

305
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,958
That there's only so much
one person can do.

306
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,125
But I've grown to care
for all of you so much,

307
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,041
that sometimes I lose
my perspective.

308
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,916
I don't mean to push myself,
but I don't always know

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,666
how to react to my feelings.

310
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,875
To be honest with you, Spark,
I'm jealous of Leaf and Ryna.

311
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:58,166
They're so open with their
feelings all the time.

312
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,750
The way I am, everything
hurts too much.

313
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,583
[RYNA]
Come on.

314
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,333
[LEAF]
Hey, wait...!

00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,875
[NEESE]
Oh, Spark, I...

317
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't you worry about it, Neese.

318
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:17,125
When this journey is over, I'm
certain your pain will go away.

00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,666
Let's both believe that.

320
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,958
Hmm.

321
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:32,083
[BOTH gasp]

322
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,166
[SPARK gasps]

323
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,083
[WAGNARD]
You insignificant flea!

324
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,666
How dare you corrupt
the Doorway's heart?!

325
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,791
The sacrifice to Kardis
must remain pure!

326
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll not let you interfere!

327
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,250
It's Wagnard!

328
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,333
[gasps]

329
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,416
The time has come
for me to take you.

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,416
And now, we shall journey
to the dark island.

331
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,875
It is your destiny.
You cannot fight it.

332
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,791
[NEESE]
No! Let me go!

333
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,375
[SPARK growls, yells]

334
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,250
"Darkness of the blackest pitch,

335
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,166
I command you to
become a dark shield

336
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
and repel this aggressor."

337
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,375
[gasps] Spark!

338
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,416
Spark, run!

339
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,625
[SPARK growls]

340
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,750
[yells]

341
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,291
[gasps]

342
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,875
[chuckles]

343
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,166
Heh!

344
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,000
[SPARK grunts]

345
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,750
No! Spark!

346
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,791
And now, Doorway,

347
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:37,041
we shall return to the
dark island of Marmo!

348
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:42,916
[NEESE]
Spark! Spark! Spark...!

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,541
Neese!

350
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
Neese!

351
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,375
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

352
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,625
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

353
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,958
the second part!

354
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,666
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

355
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,458
[NEESE] The freakin' moon's
pretty, ain't it?

356
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,458
[SPARK]
Sure is.

357
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,500
[NEESE]
A shootin'-freakin'-star.

358
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,708
I think we're supposed
to make a wish.

359
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,750
[SPARK]
Mm!

360
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,666
What did you wish for, Neese?

361
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,791
Uh... It's a secret.
How 'bout you, Spark?

362
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,958
Mine's a secret, too.

363
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,291
[BOTH chuckle nervously]

364
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,125
[screaming]

365
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,791
[BOTH giggle]

366
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:45,541
[screaming]

367
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,125
[NEESE]
That must've freakin' hurt!

368
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,875
Oh, it was nothing, really.

369
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm a knight in
training, remember?

370
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,833
Neese, what I wished
before was...

371
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,166
Yee-haw!

372
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,708
What would you do if the
Black Knight attacked you?

373
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,208
Beat him off!

374
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
[SWORDS]
Beat him off! Beat him off!

375
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,875
Spark, you've
gotten so clever...

376
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm happy beyond all words...

377
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,875
[wails]

378
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,041
Excuse me.

379
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,333
[SPARK] I wonder what King
Kashue was doing here.

380
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,750
[NEESE]
You shoulda asked him!

381
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,541
What am I, a freakin'
mind reader?!

382
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,416
[SPARK]
All right, you're alone again.

383
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,958
Don't blow it this time.

384
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,333
[PARN]
I am not an old man!

385
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,916
[DEEDLIT] Parn! Wait up!
I'm sorry! Slow down, Pops!

386
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,333
[PARN]
I'm not old!

387
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,375
[SPARK whines]
Why does everything

388
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,916
keep getting in the way...?

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,166
[NEESE]
Come on, Spark.

390
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,541
Thank you, Neese.

391
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,125
Sure thing. I know some
special "magic" that'll help

392
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,375
heal that dragon bite
for ya, Spark.

393
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,916
Sure, Neese, whatever you say.

394
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,291
Let's get a room.

395
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,041
[SPARK]
Whoa, yeah!

396
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,500
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seeing you...

397
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,375
[SPARK]
I wasn't able to protect Neese,

398
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,041
and now the Destroyer's
ressurection

399
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,916
is only a matter of time.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,125
But Parn, the free knight,
calmly continues to make plans

401
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,875
for on our advance on Roodo.

402
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,583
What should I do? I have
to decide on the first step

403
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,083
towards saving Neese.

404
