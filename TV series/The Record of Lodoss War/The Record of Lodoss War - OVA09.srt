[NARRATOR]
Light and darkness...

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,666
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,333
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

Marmo has been reduced

With their controlling

There is no order of any kind.

32

become as menacing as its name.

A sacrifice?

[WAGNARD] So young a ruler
in Lodoss is no match

35

for the power that sleeps
beneath the earth.

[PIROTESS]
You mean Kardis, don't you?

To call forth the infinite

a High Elf's life
must be offered.

Do you think your precious
Ashram can conquer Lodoss

40
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,083

Is the demon sword
"Soul Crusher,"

that has been bathed
in the demon's own blood,

the sword rules Marmo,

he that holds the Scepter of
Domination rules all Lodoss.

Far to the south is a volcano

Shooting Star, the demon

was entrusted with
the scepter by the Ancients.
