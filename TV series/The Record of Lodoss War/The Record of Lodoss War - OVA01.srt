of the Gods was closing.

Their once eternal rule
had come to an end.

3
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:40,833
The heavens trembled as the
armies of Falis, God of Light,

4
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:45,666
clashed with those of Falaris,
God of Darkness.

5
00:00:55,666 --> 00:01:01,291
Their perpetual battle
ensued; the earth wept.

The seas boiled.

7
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:23,125
In the end, each side
had but one survivor:

00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,916
Marfa, goddess of creation,

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,750
and Kardis,
goddess of destruction.

10
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:35,166
They met in a final battle that
echoed to the ends of the earth.

00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,000
[NARRATOR] When it was over,

flickered and died away.

Thousands of years
have passed.

There are safer paths

It's part of a mural, I think.

I think I've
heard about this story.

171
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,166
The time of the
final battle had come.

172
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,166
Falaris, God of Darkness,

173
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,958
led an army of a thousand
ancient dragons and evil gods

174
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,333
against Falis, the Supreme.

175
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,375
It was a vicious battle.

176
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,375
Falis, and his
forces of light,

177
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,833
against Falaris's
army of darkness...

178
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,000
In the end,
the gods were destroyed

179
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,916
by their own great power.

180
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,041
It's a very old legend.

181
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,625
[PARN] They were destroyed
by their own power?

182
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,708
[DEEDLIT] I suppose it means
they grew too powerful

183
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,250
for their own good.

184
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,666
If they were
really that powerful,

185
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,166
a war probably
wasn't necessary, huh?

186
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,666
Keep talking like that

187
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,000
and you'll never
be a real knight, Parn.

Um, I, uh--
