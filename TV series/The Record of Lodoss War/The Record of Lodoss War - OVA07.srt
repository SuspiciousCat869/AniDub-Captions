[NARRATOR]
Light and darkness...

00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,583
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,708
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,541
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,583
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,708
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,000
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:41,375
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,250
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

So what've I got

Don't be foolish, Woodchuck.

33
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,500
In a battle, this would be
the most dangerous spot.

34
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,708
The enemy always attacks the
head of the column first.

Aah, you sound pretty sure
of yourself, Deedlit.

The creatures are expendable.

49

There could be
thousands of them.

never have Lodoss!

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,333
Conquest of Lodoss
was never my desire!

166
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:42,333
Unification or conquest...
It is all the same!

167
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,125
[KARLA chuckles]

168
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:54,208
Lodoss will be neither
unified nor conquered.

169
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,625
[PARN gasps]
Your Highness!

170
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,333
[WORT]
Parn, you must stop Karla.

171
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,000
Huh?

172
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,541
[WORT]
Parn!

173
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,833
Come out here, Wort!

174
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,333
Even if this terrible war
should come to an end,

175
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,708
Lodoss will never
know true peace

176
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,041
while Karla is still alive.

177
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
[PARN]
What do you mean?

178
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,291
Karla believes that this war
is good for Lodoss.

179
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,583
And that means...

180
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,708
So, you're saying that
if I kill Karla,

181
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,541
I can put an end to this war.

182
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,750
That I cannot say
for certain, but...

183
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,791
...the death of Karla will
advert the tragedy to come.

184
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,333
A tragedy?
What do you mean by that?

185
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:57,458
Karla's strange. She doesn't
consider herself human.

186
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,458
After living for 500 years,
she's become unbalanced.

187
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,875
And although I tried,

188
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,291
I could not get her to
stop her destructive ways.

189
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,166
If she continues to interfere,
then all of Lodoss

190
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,583
will be faced with even
greater disasters to come.

191
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,875
In order to prevent this...

192
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,083
[WORT] Remove the circlet
from her forehead.

193
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:31,958
That is her true self!

194
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:36,250
[DEEDLIT]
Parn, what's wrong?

195
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,458
Now why did Wort--

196
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,458
[whooshing]

197
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:05,166
Age hasn't changed us much,
has it, my old friend.

198
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,458
Maybe not, Beld, but I'll live
long enough to see you dead!

199
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:16,125
[laughs]
My feelings exactly, Fahn.

200
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:35,875
[BOTH yelling]

201
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,416

Sire!

00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:15,125
[BELD screams]

205
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:25,250
[KARLA] Lodoss will be neither
unified nor conquered.

206
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,958
[BELD screams]

207
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,791
There is evil about!
Quickly, take cover now!

208
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,500

[growls, roars]

[PARN]
Sire!

214
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:12,875
Uh, uh, we can't
just leave him here.

215
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:18,791
[KASHUE] The dead return
to the soil of Lodoss.

216
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,541
That is the destiny
of all knights.

217
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Such is the way... of war.

218
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,791
Nameless soldiers
are like dust, Parn.

219
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,083
Nobody will ever remember them.

220
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:42,833
Only those who earned their
names are ever remembered.

221
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:06,458
A gift from my son...
for good luck.

222
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,916
[DEEDLIT]
Parn...

223
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,208
It's just not right, Deed.

224
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,833
I swear, it's...
just not right.

225
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,833
[WORT]
You must stop Karla.

226
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:27,875
Or else Lodoss may face
an even worse disaster!

227
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,125
[NARRATOR]
A war without meaning.

228
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,083
A war that saved no one.

229
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:43,000
Alas, yet another battle
must be fought.

230
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,791
As he stood amidst
a sea of bodies,

231
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:51,500
the young man vowed to challenge
Karla, the Grey Witch.

232
