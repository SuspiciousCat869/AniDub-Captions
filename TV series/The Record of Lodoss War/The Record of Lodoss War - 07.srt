1
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,583
Wait! Oh, Shiris, please wait!

2
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,625
Shiris! Shiris!

3
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,541
[SHIRIS] Oh... Would you
quit your whining, Orson?!

4
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,916
[ORSON]
Huh?!

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,708
[SHIRIS]
It's hard for everyone!

6
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,833
Can't you just shut up and
walk like the rest of us?!

7
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,208
[ORSON]
Huh.

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,958
Why don't we rest?

9
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,458
But sir...

10
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,208
I think we're finally within
striking distance of Ashram.

11
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:38,041
Besides, a forced march like
this is a drain on everyone.

12
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,791
Even if we caught
up with Ashram,

13
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,458
there'd be no way
we could beat him

14
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,875
given the condition we're in.

15
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,458
You're right. Listen up!

16
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,875
We'll stop here and
rest for a while.

17
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,750
[ORSON sighs]

18
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:07,958
Say, Parn.

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,166
[PARN]
Huh?

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,708
Orson...

21
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,791
Why do you think his
emotions came back so fast?

22
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,125
I don't know.

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,666
But I think I prefer the
old Orson to the new one.

24
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,333
He's been living without
feelings for so long.

25
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,750
I think Orson's gonna
have some trouble

26
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,291
learning how to deal with them.

27
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,958
Is that why?! Shiris!

28
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,791
[SHIRIS] Ugh, Parn! Can you do
something about this guy?!

29
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,000
At this rate,
he'll never be able to fight!

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,458
But Parn, I--
I'm too frightened to fight.

31
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,125
Then why did you even
bother to come along?

32
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,208
Because I love you!

33
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
[gasps]

34
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,708
Wh-What did you
just say, Orson?!

35
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,250
I mean it.

36
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,541
Ever since the spirit of anger
was released from my heart,

37
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,958
I realized that deep down,

38
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,791
I was in love with
you all along, Shiris.

39
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,375
And for once,
I'll be able to show you.

40
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:01,958
[SHIRIS]
Uh--

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,000
[sighs]

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,750
Hey, Orson, won't you tell us?

43
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,708
How did your feelings just
suddenly come back?

44
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,625
I think-- Here's what
happened to me.

45
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,791
I was fighting against
Ashram when he cut my arm

46
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,250
with the demon sword,
Soul Crusher.

47
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,583
I felt its power begin to
flow through my body.

48
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Then when I heard Abram's
roar on Blue Dragon Island,

49
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,000
the spirit's control over
my heart got even weaker.

50
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,791
Then... Well,
ever since that time,

51
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,958
I've been more able to
resist the spirit's control.

52
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,375
It makes sense.

53
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,208
Ashram's demon sword
and Abram's dragon roar

54
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,208
have a direct effect over
possessive spirits like Hyuri.

55
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,416
But what sort of effect are
you talking about, Deed?

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,250
Has the spirit of anger
fled his heart?

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,541
No, I can still feel him.

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,958
But he's definitely lost the
power to control my heart.

59
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,541
You should all listen up.

60
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,041
The spirit of anger exists in
the heart of every human being.

61
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,458
But as long as you can
restrain it with reason,

62
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,125
you can live with your
anger and still be happy.

63
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,416
Orson, I'm really glad you've
got your feelings back and all,

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,291
but you've got to understand,

65
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,000
the one I'm in love
with... is him!

66
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,166
[PARN]
Uh-- Uh--

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,375
[gasps] Hey!

68
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,875
Shiris, that's not really true.

69
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,083
You were angry with Parn

70
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,375
because there was no way
you could beat him,

71
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,083
so you replaced the anger
by fooling yourself

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,083
into believing
that you love him.

73
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,083
[growls]

74
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,958
You reacted just
like a little girl

75
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,708
when you lost the fight
with Ashram's lady warrior.

76
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,166
But you think it's okay
to lose to a man,

77
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,208
just as long as you're
in love with him.

78
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,833
Well, Shiris, you really
can't have it both ways.

79
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,791
[SHIRIS]
Shut up!

80
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,875
Getting your feelings back

81
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,041
doesn't mean you know
anything about me.

82
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,583
Give me a break!

83
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,375
I am honestly and
truly in love with Parn!

84
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,500
And it has nothing to do with
losing to that Amazon before!

85
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,125
You don't have any insight
into people's hearts,

86
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,125
so just shut up!

87
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm... I'm sorry.

88
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,291
We have arrived.

89
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,708
This is definitely the way
into Shooting Star's volcano.

90
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,125
Let's go.

91
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,166
Please wait a moment,
Sir Ashram.

92
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,458
What now?

93
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,250
You can see it for
yourself, Sir Ashram.

94
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,875
Shooting Star leaves his nest to
hunt for many days at a time.

95
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,666
If we wait until
Shooting Star leaves,

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,833
we can simply walk in and
get the Scepter of Domination

97
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,333
without a struggle.

98
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,833
He's right. It's suicide to
fight a fully-active dragon.

99
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,333
And there's nothing righteous

100
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,791
about fighting
unnecessary battles.

101
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,875
Somehow, I doubt it will work.

102
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,250
Groder, Smeddy, stand guard.

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,750
[GRODER, SMEDDY]
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,333
The rest of us will wait for
the beast to leave his nest.

105
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,125
Is that clear?

106
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:29,541
[roaring]

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,083
[gasps]

108
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,666
What's wrong?

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,583
[DEEDLIT]
Look!

110
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,416
[PARN]
It's Shooting Star!

111
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,416
[CECIL] Oh no!
He's headed for Raiden again!

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,416
[MAAR]
Hm?

113
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,375
Hey! Look!

114
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,791
They're here.

115
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,958
I'll get her now.

116
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,375
Some troops from Flaim?

117
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,416
We've got to fight them!

118
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,833
No, sir!

119
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,791
Shooting Star has finally
left his lair to go hunt.

120
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,500
We may never get another
chance like this.

121
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,833
Groder...

122
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,375
We'll hold them off.

123
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,916
And you must go inside
with Priest Hobb.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Get the Scepter of Domination

125
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,541
and become king of Lodoss
once and for all!

126
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,583
Heh...

127
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,791
You have a way
with words, Groder.

128
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,083
Very well, I'll leave it to you.

129
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,541
[ALL]
Sir!

130
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,416
[PARN]
Over there! It's them!

131
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,083
Looks like they don't want
us to go any further.

132
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,750
That's fine with me!

133
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,416
It looks like the little girl
and her friends have come back.

134
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,708
But there are a few
new ones with them.

135
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,625
[GRODER growls]

136
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,708
[GRODER]
It's that grass runner.

137
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,333
Watch me now, Orson.

138
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,375
I'll show you and everybody else

139
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,583
that I can beat that
woman warrior.

140
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,083
But Shiris!

141
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,541
You're still tired from your
trek through the mountains!

142
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,791
Maybe you should rest first.

143
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,125
I'll be fine.

144
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,375
I'm gonna settle this
with her in no time flat.

145
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,666
But... you'll die!

146
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,666
[PARN] Something's wrong.
I don't see Ashram.

147
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,083
That must mean he's--

148
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
[GRODER]
Ashram's destiny must prevail.

149
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,291
Now go. Protect us from them!

150
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,958
Look at them!

151
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,375
Highness, Ashram's
not with them!

152
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,250
I know. He must be
inside the volcano.

153
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,208
With Shooting Star
away from his nest,

154
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,958
even a child could
grab the scepter.

155
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
[PARN]
Then there's no time to waste.

156
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,708
You go in, sir.
Leave this to me.

157
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,083
Right, Parn.

158
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,916
All right now, let's go!

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,041
[PARN yelling]

160
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,750
Stop that man!

I really didn't expect to see
you again, my little girl.

I didn't think she'd be able to
summon the king of the wind!

If two spirits this

it would be catastrophic!
