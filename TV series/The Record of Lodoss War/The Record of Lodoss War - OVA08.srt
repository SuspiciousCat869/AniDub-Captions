Light and darkness...

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,666
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,333
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

[NARRATOR] The war between Beld,
the dark emperor of Marmo,

27
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,750
and King Fahn of Valis,
has shaken all of Lodoss.

28
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,416
It ended in the deaths
of both leaders.

29

In generations to come,

30
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,375
this battle will be known
as "The War of Heroes."

31
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,250
But few will know of the
mysterious, shadowy forces

32
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,833
that were at work
behind the scenes.

33
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,666
Is that for Leylia?

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,541
It is.

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,750
I think she'd expect something
a bit fancier, don't you?

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,666
Listen to me.

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
This is a gift for Leylia.

The woman you've seen so far
is a witch named Karla.

[SHIRIS] Boy,
that really burns me up!

to protect his village!

make you mad?! Orson!

What is it with you?!

43
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,458
The war ends and
they just boot us out

44
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,208
like we were
some sort of enemy!

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,458

they're from?

Huh, I don't know.

00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,291
One of them looks
like a mercenary.

50
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,500
The other's a thief, I think...

51
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,875
And... an elf?

52
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,541
An elf. Marmo?

53
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,083
It could be. Hmm...

54
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,416
And they're headed
straight for the village.

55

It's not our problem anymore.

Tell me why! Why did you
have to kill Beld, Karla?!

172
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,916
[KARLA] Oh. Would you
have preferred it

173
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,208
if Beld conquered Lodoss?

174

What?!

175
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,666
[KARLA] Do you really think I
would've given Lodoss to him?

Or anyone else, for that matter.

Had Fahn survived,

the outcome would
have been the same.

180
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,916
All was done to save
Lodoss from destruction.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,166
All so Lodoss
could survive forever.

It's no lie.
I love Lodoss, as you do.

[KARLA]
Look well upon this.

204
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,166
The destruction of Kastuul,
glorious Kingdom of Sorcery.

205
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,625
The Kingdom of Sorcery...
What... What do you mean?

206
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,833
[KARLA] Endless battles
to recover the power

207
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,041
of total domination.

208
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,583
Such is the torment of Lodoss.

209
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,208
The destruction
of Kastuul, my homeland,

210
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,833
left me with one lesson:

211
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,000
power must never again
be allowed to settle

212
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,375
in just one place.

213
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,958
As long as
it remains scattered,

214
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,625
the destruction
will never be complete.

215
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,625
And so I cause these wars.

Yes, for the past
five centuries,

217
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,750
I have thus protected Lodoss.

Will you not come along

222

and guide the future
of Lodoss with me?

223

Come. Throw off
your old armor

Someone who
truly protects Lodoss

229
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,333
wouldn't do it by playing
with other people's lives.
