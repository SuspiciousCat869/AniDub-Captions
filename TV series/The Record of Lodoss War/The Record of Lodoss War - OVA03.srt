For Valis?

Yep! You want the strongest

So, are these

Aye.

You're wrong, believe me!

It's true. We're just a group

There've been a number
of disturbances lately,

We're sincerely grateful
for your understanding.

So, what'd he tell you?

00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,791
That Emperor Beld and the Marmo
troops are headed this way.

195
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,916
True. Kannon is a lost cause.

And Alania?

We are awaiting
the final decision

But somehow,
these men seem different.

The men who come here

They have too much strength

eyes gazed back in hatred,

323
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,291
the spark of battle was ignited.

324
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,625
<i>Let all the wonders</i>
<i>come to me</i>

325
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:10,166
<i>The fantasy fills,</i>
<i>fills my heart</i>

326
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,208
<i>I'll never wander anymore</i>

327
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,541
<i>For all the love I have,</i>
<i>I have for you</i>

328
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>All the spirits of the wind</i>

329
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:26,000
<i>Spread their magic</i>
<i>wings and fly</i>

330
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:30,708
<i>Racing at the speed of light</i>

331
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:37,583
<i>Through the valleys</i>
<i>and the passages of time</i>

332
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,666
<i>When we fell in love</i>

333
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,541
<i>Destiny</i>

334
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,583
<i>Now each night</i>
<i>will have no end</i>

335
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,833
<i>Our nights will never end</i>

336
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,208
<i>Eternity awaits</i>

337
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,208
<i>You and me</i>

338
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:56,625
<i>Now that you are here</i>

339
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,625
<i>We'll never be alone again</i>

340
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,458
<i>Stay with me, my love</i>
