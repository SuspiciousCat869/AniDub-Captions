You're right, Priest Hobb.

[KARLA] And now the trials
of my design shall begin.

79
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:29,041
Within Lodoss, there must be
always exist a balance of power.

80
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:33,000
These united heroes are
no more than meddlers

81
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:37,541
who disrupt that
which I have created.

82
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:43,375
And if these meddlers
should cease to exist...

83
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,500
The time approaches
once again for Lodoss

84
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,416
to return to the grey.
If I can succeed,

85
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,333
then there would be no need
to resurrect the Destroyer.

Hey! This is impossible!

322
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,166
My cookies taste much
better than hers!

323
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,083
Huh? I was so busy trying
to mess up her cookies,

324
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,208
I forgot to bake my own!

These taste great!
You really are the best!

328
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,333
Hot stuff!

329
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm not so sure anymore.

We'll be seein' ya.

Soaring upon giant wings,

334
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,458
burning the earth dark
with its fire breath...

335
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,291
We face Narse, the evil dragon.

336
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,208
Our struggle continues as
we meet the Grey Witch.

00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,208
Is Karla really helping to
resurrect Kardis the Destroyer?
