The power... This is the power
of Kardis the Destroyer!

00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,791
And now, I shall rule the dead!

It seems you're too late.
There's nothing you can do now.

16
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,291
The resurrection
ceremony is over.

17
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,833
The time has come

18
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,208
for me to become lord
of the kingdom of death!

19
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,375
Slayn, what does he mean?

20
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,083
The forbidden spells
that Wagnard stole

21
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,833
gave him the powers
of eternal sorcery.

22
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,375
It is the ultimate gift
of the Destroyer's power.

23
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,125
If Kardis the Destroyer
is allowed to be released

24
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,416
into the world,
then everyone will die!

[SPARK]
That's what this is all about?!

26
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,541
If Wagnard should get his way,
he will turn Lodoss

27
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,333
into a land of the dead and
rule forever as its king.

I will finally be released

from the pain of
Ralkas' punishment!

32
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,916
All that's left is to open
the body of the Doorway

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,125
and Kardis shall
finally be reborn!

up in that mist,

Why...? Why are you doing this?

I know you think your
actions are justified,

but can any good come of this?

Oh, no... I thought you
hated dark sorcery.

87
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,291
So why, Karla? The people of
Kastuul destroyed themselves

88
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,500
because they frogot their
limits, but Kardis' resurrection

89
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,375
will kill everyone on Lodoss!

Surely you must understand
what that means!

91
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,958
To me, it's not a question
as to whether the power

92

is good or evil.

[KARLA] A great power must be
balanced by another great power.

95
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,166
It is the only way to ensure
a lasting peace for Lodoss.

96
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,166
Karla, if you keep this up...

97
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,208
...I swear that I will...

98
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,958
Kill me?

99
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:37,083
Very well. But remember that
the moment your blade

100
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:42,958
pierces my breast, my mind will
take complete control over you.

101
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,291
Would you like to
open the Doorway

102
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,625
with your own hands, Leylia?

103
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
Lady Leylia...

104
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,375
Karla's true form is
in the golden circlet.

105
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,583
It allows her to completely
posess the body

106
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,875
of anyone who touches
it or who kills her.

107
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,541
You mean...

108
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,000
[SLAYN] Yes, she can
move from body to body.

109
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,916
She can even select her hosts.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,333
As long as Karla still exists--

111
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,666
Are you saying, Master Slayn,
that there's nothing we can do?

112
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,125
We must not kill her, Aldonova.

113
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:21,375
All we can try to do is get
that circlet off her head.

114
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,791
[KARLA] The turning gears of
fate cannot be stopped now.

115

This is the destiny of Lodoss.

of for so very long!

I swore I'd save Neese even

00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,958
Garrack was only following

When Spark said that
he'd be the decoy,

Garrack knew there would
be no way to stop him,

He'd call himself a mercenary,

he was more valiant and selfless
than the bravest knight.
