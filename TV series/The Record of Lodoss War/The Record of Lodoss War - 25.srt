The dark power is growing even

Neese is, it won't help!

Huh. I really didn't think
you'd make it this far.

for a long time.

There is nothing we
can do to stop it.

That's not a good reason.

My only purpose now is to lead

How could you possibly
understand the hardships that

we've been forced to endure on
this monster-infested island?!

You're too self-righteous

to know the truth!

107
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,541
We only invaded Lodoss because
we had no other choices left!

might've had on Lodoss!

So, what're you
planning to do now?

123
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,375
I shall lead the people
of Marmo out to sea.

124
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666
And together, we shall
find a new land.

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,750
[gasps] In search of a new land?

126
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,500
I cannot think of a
single kingdom on Lodoss

127
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,666
that would actually welcome
the people of Marmo.

128

[ASHRAM] When Wagnard's
spell is complete,

129
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,750
this island will
no longer exist.

130
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,000
I must do whatever's necessary
to preserve the lives

131
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:37,541
of my people. The good,
hard-working people of Marmo.

132
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,291
And no matter what
trials we may face,

133
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,916
I am determined to
see this through.

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,375
We will build a new kingdom,
and we shall thrive.

135
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,958
This would make a great ballad.

"The song of Sir Ashram."

137

He's such a hero.

[ASHRAM] You and I shall
never meet again.

Wait for me, my lord!

141
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,458
Fare thee well, Black Knight.

[laughs]

144
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,750
In the end, I really didn't
have to beat Ashram.

145
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,750
Right.

146
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,750
And maybe that's the
point of all of this.

147
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,500
Ashram and I both have
many goals to live for.

148
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,041
And as long as we can achieve
them, then winning a sword fight

149
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,416
doesn't really matter.

150
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,125
Still, that didn't stop you
two from fighting, Parn.

151
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,583
Ashram said it himself once.

152
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,750
As long as he and I live,
our battle will never end.

153
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,458
[HOBB] True. The real
battle is yet to come.

154
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,375
Although you may never
again fight with him,

155
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,000
you and Ashram will continue
to battle as you both lead

156
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,458
your people as kings.

157
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,666
But I don't have what
it takes to be a king.

158
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,541
[HOBB] Here, let me cast
a healing spell for you.

159
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,708
It's not serious, Priest Hobb.

160
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,708
And I think your time has come.

161
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,041
[HOBB]
Huh?

162
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,625
I want to thank you from
the bottom of my heart

163
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,708
for all of your valuable help,
but it's clear to me that

164
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,416
your path is headed in
a different direction.

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,333
Parn...

166
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,791
It's written all over your face.

167
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,250
In order to confirm
your faith in Myrii,

168
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,166
you must continue to
seek out true heroism.

169
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,708
My battle will soon be over,
but Ashram's struggles

170
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,333
are just beginning.

171
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,833
For the sake of
the people of Marmo,

172
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:18,250
Ashram is setting out into a
world he knows nothing about.

173
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,291
That's the work of a true hero.

174
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,458
Sir Parn, I... I'm happy
beyond all words.

175
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,583
It's been an honor to have
served a great hero like you.

176
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,125
And now, you're allowing me

177
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,083
to pursue my own
calling once again.

178
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:39,083
Ah... Myrii, great God of War,
I thank you, Lord!

179
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,291
Huh... He's gonna get to
watch history happen...

180
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,625
Hah! Well someone's got
to write a song about it!

181
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,458
Let's go, Parn. If we hurry,
we can still help them.

182
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,291
[PARN] You're right.
We've taken a lot of time here.

183
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,291
Let's go, Deed.

184
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,041
Um... Where's Maar?

185
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:06,875
Maar!

186
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,666
[MAAR]
Hey! Wait for me!

187
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,916
What's with him?! He panics at
the slightest sign of danger!

188
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,791
But he's just too curious.

189
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,416
[MAAR] Don't forget me!
I'll see you again someday!

190
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,458
[MAAR]
Hey! Wait up!

191

[GARRACK, ALDONOVA grunt]

192
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,041
Where are we?

193
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,708
Hey, what's going on?
Is this some sort of dead end?

194
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,458
Forgive me, Lady Leylia,
but are you certain

195
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,416
that this is where
you felt the evil?

196
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,083
This is where I felt them...
The evil presence is strong,

197
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:56,333
but it may be a trick.
I just don't know...

198
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,291
[GREEVUS growls] There must
be some clue around here.

199
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,583
Everybody, look for something.

200
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,375
What do you mean, "something"?

201
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,208
[SPARK] There's probably
a secret passage

202
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,708
that leads to Wagnard and Neese.

203
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,875
We can't afford to
waste any more time!

204
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,791
Now I want you to check every
wall seam, every column!

205
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,750
There must be a way in!

[GREEVUS growls]

207
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,333
I'm guessing if
there's a trigger,

208
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,083
it's gotta be right here.

209
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,416
Why would anyone hide
something in a place

210
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,875
where everyone would
look for it, Garrack?

211
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,458
Hey, you! I don't need
any of your wisecracks!

212
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,000
Now help me!

213
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,875
[SPARK] Damn... This can't
just be a dead end.
