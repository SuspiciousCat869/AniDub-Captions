[SLAYN]
There are two dragons.

146
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,083
There's Shooting Star and Abram.

147
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,750
And we have no way of knowing

148
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,541
which one holds the
Scepter of Domination.

149
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,750
If Abram is the one who
really has the scepter,

150
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,500
then while we're all off
killing Shooting Star...

...Ashram is off killing Abram.

152

And he would be the one
to get the scepter.

153
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,916
Then... what should we do?

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,500
It's simple. All we have
to do is send forces

155
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,541
to go after both of the
dragons simultaneously.

156
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
Splitting my forces would
be the right move.

157
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,333
But we haven't sufficient
numbers to do so.

Uh... But you won't
have to do that.

160
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,625
Ashram isn't running around
with a big army, is he?

161
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,583
So we should send a small force.

162
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,083
Just a few good men.

163
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,458
It's quality,
not quantity, am I right?

164
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,541
Quality, not quantity...
You tend to oversimplify.

165
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,250
But you make a good point.

166
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,666
If that's the case,

167
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,458
then you can leave the job
of killing Abram to us.

168
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,500
But you don't--

169
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,916
To kill Shooting Star,

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,291
the most experienced military
people should be used.

171
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,375
That's why we should be
the ones to go after Abram.

172
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,666
Parn, take Deed
and use your talents

173
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,125
where they're most needed.

174
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,541
You won't need the help of
a sorcerer's magic for this.

175
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,166
Highness, I believe Orson
should be the one

176
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,916
to lead us to Blue
Dragon Island.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,958
O-Orson?

178
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,166
What happened here?!

179
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,375
[ASHRAM]
It seems the rumors

180
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,500
of Shooting Star's
restlessness are true.

181
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,583
They're all dead.

182
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:25,208
So this is the awesome power
of our enemy. Very well.

183
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,291
What's the matter?
Are you nervous, Priest Hobb?

184
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,083
I am a man of complete faith.

185
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,750
Myrii will protect us all.

186
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,791
That's just what I want to hear.

187
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,500
I have great hopes
for you, Priest. Hyah!

188
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,916
Hyah!

189
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,916
[SHIRIS] You want to
make Orson the leader?!

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,416
Yes. I've been thinking about
it since our journey began.

191
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,416
About how to help free Orson
from the spirit of anger.

192
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,625
And how to prevent him
from becoming a berserker.

193
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,375
The answer was in front
of me the whole time.

194
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,791
It was you, Parn. It was you!

195
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,583
Me?

196
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,833
Throughout our travels,

197
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,875
you have experienced so
many different things.

198
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,875
As our leader, more than
any of the rest of us,

199
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,333
you've learned to accept
the strong feelings

200
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,333
you carry inside you.

201
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,208
I see! If Orson is able
to learn to accept

202
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,166
the strong feelings
inside of him,

203
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,791
then he'll be released
from the spirit of anger!

204
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,625
Besides that,
he's quite level-headed.

205
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,583
Making decisions as a leader
should not be hard for him.

206
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,958
Do you really think
I'm level-headed?

207
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,166
Please wait. You know I don't
have what it takes to lead.

208
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,416
Besides, if I become
a berserker again,

209
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,041
there's no telling
who I might hurt.

210
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,333
Orson...

211
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,166
I believe in the strength
of your will, Orson.

212
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,416
Huh?

213
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,458
If you think like a leader
and act like one,

214
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,333
the result will be that you'll
feel like one in your heart.

215
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,708
Then, I'm certain that
the normal feelings

216
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,666
will reawaken within you.

217
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,041
Great idea! Let's try it out!

218
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,666
If it works, you won't
become a berserker again.

219
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,500
[gasps]

220
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,458
You're so distracted.
Is there something wrong?

221
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,000
Hm? No. I'm all right.

222

Shiris...

225
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,791
[SHIRIS]
So, what do you think?

226
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,875
I hardly ever get
to wear a dress.

227
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,416
Uh... You look just fine.

228
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,375
[SHIRIS]
Thank you.

229
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,875
So would you like to dance?

230
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,625
No, thanks. I'm an awful dancer.

231
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,583
Who cares how bad you are?

232
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,750
But Parn!

233
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,166
[SHIRIS]
C'mon! C'mon!

234
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,250
[ORSON]
Thanks.

235
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,541
I thought Parn
was your boyfriend.

236
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,500
Doesn't this bother you?

237
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,916
I wonder sometimes.

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,875
After all, I'm an elf and
he's a human, you know?

239
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,000
Shiris really seems
to like Parn though.

240
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,208
How 'bout you? Do you mind?

241
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,875
I don't know.
I have no feelings.

242
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,041
I haven't felt love
since I was a child.

243
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,208
I see. But don't worry, though.

244
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,125
I'm sure this journey will
help you to feel once again.

245
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,666
I hope you're right.

246
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,541
If not, then making me
leader will be a waste.

247
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,458
[SHIRIS giggles] Come on,
Parn. Like this!

248

Forgive me, Your Highness!

253
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:51,500
It's all right. You're the
new one. Shiris, isn't it?

254
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,416
Oh, yes. That's right.
Thank you, sire.

255
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,000
So Parn, are you
enjoing yourself?

256
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,375
Well-- Well, I--

257
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,666
Still honest as ever.

258
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,000
You must think it's wrong for us

to be having a party
to boost our morale

260
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,750
while others in Flaim are
going hungry, am I right?

261
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,416
[PARN]
No, i-it's not that...

262
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,333
But sharing in the
people's suffering

263
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,541
is not the job of the king.

264
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,666
My only job is to
save them from it.

265
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,000
I agree.

266
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,208
But as long as Shooting
Star lives, there's no way

267
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,458
to save the refugees
or the citizens of Flaim.

268
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,125
And there's another
threat--Ashram.

269
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,708
Uh... Your Highness?

270

Hmm? Oh, yes! I almost forgot.

271
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,166
Let me introduce you.

Hello.

I saw you this afternoon.

274

This is Spark. He shows
a lot of promise.

275
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,708
In exchange for serving me,

276
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm letting him study
and train with us.

277
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,250
An honor, sir. It's really
a privilege to meet you.

278
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,583
It-- Well, it's my dream to
become a knight like you.

279
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,875
Why, thank you.

280
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,916
Oh, yes. You know, Parn,

281
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,583
every single young person
in Flaim looks up to you.

282
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,791
You are their model knight.

283
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,250
[PARN]
I'm their model?

284
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,750
Thank you, Spark.

285
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sure that one day,

286
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,916
you'll become an even
better knight than I am.

Oh! It's not fair!

any feelings, Orson,

tell me that I look nice?

00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,791
How would you like to be a king?

318
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,833
Uh... A king?

319
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,541
[KASHUE] I know what's
going on in Alania.

320
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,750
The villages in the north
have declared independence,

321
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,791
and a certain hero has
been causing trouble

322
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,958
for Duke Raster, hasn't he?

323
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,583
I'm not a hero. I haven't
been doing it alone.

324
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,083
So much of our success
is due to Slayn

325
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,416
and the rest of the
people of Zaxon.

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,291
But people seek out heroes,

327
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,625
especially in a world
so torn by war.

328
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,791
I would be glad see
you become king

329
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,000
and ascend the throne of Alania.

330
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,583
I think the people of Alania
would like that, too.

331
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,166
But I don't believe
I could ever have

332
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,500
what it takes to be a real king.

333
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,833
Oh, please. A king is just
a face for his kingdom.

334
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,916
Besides, you have
excellent friends.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,166
If you need advice,
you can just ask for it.

336
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,833
[PARN]
Yes, but...

337
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,250
You must have heard the reports
about Valis's new king.

338
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,083
[PARN]
We've heard about it in Alania,

339
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,250
but we don't know
who the new king is.

340
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,833
Don't be too shocked now,

341
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,375
but the new king of Valis is
a very good friend of yours.

342
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,416
It's the High Priest, Etoh.

343
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,541
[gasps] You mean--
It's my Etoh?! Huh?!

344
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,666
Yes, and if he can do it,
then so can you.

345
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,375
Besides, all men
dream of being king.

346
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,791
This is a great chance for you.

347
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,916
I need some time to think.

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,250
[KASHUE]
Of course.

349
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,500
Save your decision until
this trouble is behind us.

350
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,458
But know that if you
do decide to be king,

351
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,583
Flaim will stand by
you all the way.

352
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,750
And besides that, Parn,
when you finally become king,

353
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,500
I will be able to treat
you as an equal.

354
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,291
And nothing would
make me happier.

355
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,500
[yells]

356
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,583
[PARN]
I have to concentrate now!

357
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,333
The dragon must die.

358
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,416
And we must crush Ashram's
ambitions for Marmo!

359
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,166
To ensure a safe
future for Lodoss!

360
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,375
--Welcome...
--...to Lodoss Island!

361
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,875
What you've all
been waiting for...

362
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,833
...the second part!

363
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,208
[giggles]

364
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,166
What's keeping King Kashue?

365
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,833
Tell me, is it true that he's
a master swordsman?

366
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,583
Oh, he sure gave Parn a
licking a few years ago.

367
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,000
[PARN]
Ouch.

368
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,541
[KASHUE]
All right, let's go!

369
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,666
[KASHUE]
There it is!

370
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,375
[BOTH stammering]

371
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,833
What's a knight in bed?

372
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,958
A "good knight!"

373
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,958
[groaning]

374
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,500
A wobbly shield?

375
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,208
A "shindo!"

376
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,416
A dragon sport?

377
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Uh-- Um-- Uh--

378
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,625
A drampoline?

379
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,791
Don't answer a pun
with a question!

380
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,708
[KASHUE chuckles]

381
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,083
What kinda specialty is that?

382
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,291
I've got it! I've got it!

383
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,958
But what is it, Parn?

384
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,875
The king's opening line will be:

385
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,291
"I'm King Kashue,
and this is my cashew.

386
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,041
I'm really quite a nut!"

387
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,833
That's gotta be it!

388
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,208
[DEEDLIT, SHIRIS groan]

389
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,666
[giggles] Oh, Parn, come on!

390
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,875
Oh, please! That guy's the king!

391
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,750
He'd never come out using
a stupid line like that!

392
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,791
I... I guess not...

393
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,000
[KASHUE] You've grown
in your skills, Parn.

394
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,375
Oh, I'm so proud...

395
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,583
[sobbing]

396
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,875
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

397
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,625
[DEEDLIT]
The free city of Raiden.

398
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,708
The port leading to
Blue Dragon Island,

399
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,791
home of Abram, the water dragon.

400
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,666
But with the people of the
city living in fear of pirates,

401
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,250
no one dares to
venture out to sea.

402
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,125
What will our new
leader Orson decide?

403
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,666
Next time, on
<i>Record of Lodoss War:</i>

404
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:</i>

405
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,875
"Pirates... The Ship
of Dark Ambitions."
