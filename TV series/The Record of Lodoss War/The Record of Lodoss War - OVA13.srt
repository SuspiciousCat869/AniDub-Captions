The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458

to call this new continent

Hang on!

00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,375
No... No, stay back...

00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,666
Save yourself, Parn...

175
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,791
Stay back...

176
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,500
Hang on! Deedlit! Deedlit!

177
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,166
Wait for me!

[grunts]

00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,916
Please, Parn...
Stay back... Parn...

No...

What's going on?!

[WORT]
Well, what now?

191
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:27,000
[KARLA] Did you come here
only to lecture me, Wort?

192
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,708
[WORT] We once
fought side by side.

193
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:37,916
Surely you don't mind me seeing
through an old friend's destiny?

194
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,458
Perhaps not.

195
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,916
But know this: should
the balance of power

196
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,125
on Lodoss ever tip again...

197
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:51,916
then you and I shall
surely meet once more.

[NARRATOR]
The kingdom of Valis

201
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,625
was overflowing
with celebration.

202
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,041
Prayers gave way to
shouts of congratulation

203
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,291
and songs of joy.

204
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,708
The young man who subdued Marmo
was proclaimed a knight,

205
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,791
and in Lodoss,
a new hero was born.

206
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,375
The sword and armor
of a Holy Knight.

207
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,750
Do you think Parn
will look good in them?

208
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm sure.

209
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,250
[KASHUE]
Hmm?

210

[footsteps]

211
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,708
[KASHUE]
You're going?

212
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,375
Yes, I am, Your Highness.

213
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,166
I won't stop you. However...

214
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,166
...I want you to take this.

215
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,708
I expect to see you again.

216
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,500
Yes.

217
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,500
[KASHUE]
Knight of Lodoss...

218
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,625
Never forget there is honor
in all that you do.

219
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,500
Yes, sir.

220
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,375
Trying to sneak off
without me, huh?

221
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:40,166
Lodoss can get awfully
lonesome sometimes, you know.

222
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,916
[horse neighs]

223
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,750
Parn and Deed
will be back again...

224
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,458
Someday, I'm sure.

225
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,791
We'll wait for them.

226
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,708
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

227
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,958
Parn knows his friends will
always be there to help.

228
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,000
You're right.

229
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,416
I wonder... Is our job done?

230
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,625
We can only hope so.

231
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,541
[ETOH]
Parn...

232
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:32,791
[NARRATOR] There once was a boy
who dreamed of being a hero.

233
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,500
Who believed sincerely in the
battle to banish darkness

234
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,000
from a world of light.

235
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,875
But light and
darkness are equal,

236
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,083
and where one exists,
so, too, must the other.

237
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,875
And when the boy
finally realized this,

238
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:54,541
he had taken the first step
toward being a true hero.

239
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,166
Yah!
