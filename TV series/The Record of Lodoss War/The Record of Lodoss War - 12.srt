Taking over Alania is one thing,

160
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,500
Okay, come with me.
C'mon, let's go!

161
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,583
[NEESE]
Uh, Leaf?

[door creaks]

164
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,583
[ALDO]
Mm? Hm... Uh.

165
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,583
Didn't I just hear Miss Leaf
and Lady Neese talking in here?

166
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,416
The young ladies have
gone off to discover...

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,791
..."the wonderful
course of love."

168
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,791
Huh?!

169
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,125
I only wanna know one thing.

170
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,291
Why are you trying
to get so close to us?

171
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,666
So close?

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,916
If you're looking
to travel cheap, okay,

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,875
but if you're up
to anything else...

174
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,416
...you'd better start running.

175
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,333
If you wanna stay alive.

176
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,666
There's only one
thing I'm after.

177
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,250
and that's revenge
for Randy's death.

178
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,500
You expect me to believe that?

179
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,458
If you had to stand by and
watch your lover get killed,

180
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,541
I bet you would.

181
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,916
Besides, if I really
did run off,

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,416
it would betray the
code of the thieves.

183
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,500
I doubted you. I'm sorry.

184
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,708
Uh?

185
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,083
[RYNA]
Thank you.

186
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,250
But if I do find that you've
betrayed us in any way,

187
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,875
then I'll bury that dagger
right here, in your chest.

188
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,416
[RYNA]
I'll keep that in mind.

189
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,750
Well, then! Why don't
you get some rest?

190
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,708
Not so fast!

191
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,291
Now I want you to
answer a question.

192
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,916
Come on. I know
you're not a mercenary.

193
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,541
Now. Who are
you really, Garrack?

194
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,166
[GARRACK laughs]

195
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,291
What are you talking about?!

196
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,166
Do I look like anything other
than a mercenary to you?

197
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,083
Oh, I'm not saying
that I don't trust you...

198
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,958
...but I really wouldn't want to
see Spark betrayed, either now.

199
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,333
[GARRACK sighs]

200
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,083
But the others don't
need to know about this.

201
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,958
We thieves don't betray trust.

202
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,041
[LEAF]
Oh... Man...

203
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,208
What are they talking about?!

204
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,708
[NEESE] Are you sure we
should be doing this?

205
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,875
[LEAF]
Sure, I'm sure!

206
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,125
It serves him right
for kicking us out!

207
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,875
Okay, we can peek
in through here.

208
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,416
Hey, let's choose!

209
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,541
"Let's choose"?

210
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,250
[LEAF]
Yeah.

211
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,208
One of us holds the
other on her shoulders

212
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,125
while the other one gets to
climb up and peek inside.

213
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,500
Now, let's see who gets
to do the peeking.

214
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,916
B-But, Leaf...

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,916
This way it's
completely fair! Right?

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Uh. Right...

217
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,291
Oh, and no magic, either!

218
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,666
Of course not.

219
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,041
Good!

220
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,333

Aldonova.

223
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,541
What are you doing out
here in the hallway?

224
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,416
You really should
be in your room.

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,041
Are you curious, too? Have you
come to sneak a peek, Aldo?

226
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,208
Why! I never would!

227

me right now!

Bye, Leaf!

Hey! Now I'll never
get to see them!

230
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,416
A nobleman?! Are you kidding?

231
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,333
Oh, don't give me that look.

232
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,875
Look at my face. Look at me.

233
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,000
You can tell I'm not
exactly a model nobleman.

234
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,291
I've heard of men like you.

235
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,833
Overseer mercenaries who
are placed in the ranks

236
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,666
to police the men.

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,666
I've also heard that you
don't hesitate to kill

238
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,958
those who break the law or
collaborate with the enemy.

239
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,250
Well, it really
isn't that unusual

240
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,583
for a soldier to lose his
life on the battlefield.

241
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,041
And you do that, Garrack?

242
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,833
My current job is to protect

243
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,416
our incredibly eager,
young captain from danger.

244
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,833
You mean...

245
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,333
Yeah.

246
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,958
There's a chance he could become
the king of Flaim someday.

247
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,208
Assuming he doesn't get
himself killed first.

248
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,583
Those are King Kashue's
real intentions,

249
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,416
and that's the reason he
gave me this assignment.

250
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,833
It's pretty much
a losing battle--

251
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,375
taking care of our
captain is no easy job.

You seem to be enjoying it.

253
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,000
It's not easy to
leave him alone.

Believe me when I tell
you he's one strange bird.

[laughs]
What do you mean?

256
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,833
Well, he seems to
attract outcasts

257
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,000
and misfits like you and me.

258
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,666
And they say you're judged
by the company you keep.

259
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,000
[ALDO] Lady Neese,
do you really have to go?

[NEESE]
Mm.

261
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,500
Does Master Slayn
know about this?

262
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,333
Yes. My Mother, too.

263
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,000
They both know.

264
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,166
And I think they both understand
why I'm making this journey.

265
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,625
Yes, but, uh...

266
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,750
Why can't you understand
that this is a problem

267
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,791
I must face on my own?

268
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,750
Ever since the Soul
Crystal Ball was stolen...

No...

My fate was decided the
moment I had that nightmare.

Nothing will ever be the same.

It was! Until Garrack
threw me out because

he wanted to teach Ryna a

What's all the commotion?

318
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:41,625
[SPARK] Uh... It was, uh...
I-It was nothing at all!

319
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,458
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

320
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,541
[RYNA, GARRACK]
Mm?

321
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,750
Yeah, there's nothing
to worry about.

322
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
We know that you and
Garrack are in love!

323
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,875
[SPARK, GARRACK]
Huh?

324
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,166
Hey! What's that
supposed to mean?

325
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,958
Now, now! There's nothing to
be embarrassed about, Ryna.

326
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,416
Right, Spark?

327
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,875
Now that's enough!

328
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,500
There's absolutely
nothing going on!

329
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,250
First of all, this muscle-bound
ape is not my type!

330
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,750
Well, excuse me for
having a physique.

331
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,208
My muscles happen to
be my best feature!

332
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,166
What have we here? Is it a
lover's quarrel already?

333
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,875
[grunts]

334
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,041
What's the big idea?!

335
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,416
Just shut up!

336
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,166
It's your fault for starting
up irresponsible rumors

337
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,125
about us in the first place!

338
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,541
[LEAF] Oh, yeah?
Well, you were the one

339
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,583
who threw me out of my room!

340
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,666
[GARRACK] So, you're saying
this is my fault?!

341
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,458
[SPARK]
Would you both just cut it out?!

342
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,375
You're acting like
a couple of kids!

343
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,041
[GARRACK, LEAF]
Get lost!

344
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,541
[GREEVUS] Let them do as
their hearts direct them.

345
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,875
If you interrupt,

346
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,375
bad feelings will
remain between them.

347
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,666
[GARRACK, LEAF chattering]

348
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,875
[sighs]

349
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,041
What did I do to deserve this?

350
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,166
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
news that the Dark Elves

351
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,916
had been sighted to
the south of Hiruto

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,375
reached Governor Randal,

353
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,583
who quickly dispatched
troops to track them.

354
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,791
Upon hearing this,

355
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,583
Spark and the others
soon joined the pursuit.

356
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,958
[SPARK]
Hurry up! Let's go!

357
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,500
[GARRACK]
Are we really going?!

358
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,458
[LEAF] At this rate
I'll never get any rest!

359
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,750
Where's Aldo?

360
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,500
[ALDO]
Right here.

361
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,750
Huh?! Huh...?

362
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,250
I'm coming along with you.

363
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,916
Uh, Neese, I don't
think you really know

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,333
what you're in for here.

365
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,166
That's enough! We're not going
to be traveling anymore!

366
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,500
This is war!

367
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,083
That's right.

368
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,958
And Lady Neese's holy magic will
be most useful to us in battle.

369
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,125
Please, Spark.

370
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,583
Aldo, this is not her fight.

371
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,166
It may not be my fight,
but it is my destiny...

372
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,875
...so it becomes
my fight as well.

373
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,083
[SPARK]
Huh?

374
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,500
No matter what you say,
I'm coming with you.

375
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,291
[LEAF]
I bet the other pursuit team

376
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,916
already found the Dark Elves.

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,375
[RYNA]
I hope not.

378
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,458
I wanna avenge Randy's
death with my own hands.

379
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,708
[GARRACK]
Yeah...

380
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,500
[SPARK] I must focus on
completing my mission now.

381
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,583
It's the only thing that--

382
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,083
[PARN]
Don't become a man who lives

383
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,583
only for the duty given
that's given to him.

384
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,791
[SPARK] A man who only
lives for his duty. Huh.

385
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,791
[GREEVUS]
There they are!

386
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,875
[SPARK]
Huh?!

387
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:24,750
[GREEVUS]
It's them.

388
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,500
[ALL gasp]

389
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,333
I'll go on ahead!

390
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,750
Master Spark!

391
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,416
Now we've got a captain
who's really worth protecting!

392
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,125
[RYNA grunts]

393
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,583
[SPARK yells]

394
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,833
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

395
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,833
And now, what you've been
waiting for, the second part!

396
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,291
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

397
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
[NEESE humming]

398
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,666
Ah! The weather's so nice,

399
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,000
it's a perfect day
for a picnic! Right?

400
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,083
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Mm-hm!

401
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,541
[SPARK]
Come and get us, Dark Elf!

402
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,125
Huh?

403
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,500
I shall defend Neese's cookies
and become a knight of Flaim!

404
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,041
Is this getting old yet?

405
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,416
[NEESE] Want to join
me for lunch, Spark?

406
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,125
Huh?

407
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,000
These plums are great!

408
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,500
Man! What kind of mission
did I get stuck with?

409
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,125
[NEESE] I've got some
okaka rice balls for you!

410
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,375
Rice balls?!
I'll be right there!

411
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,000
Okaka, okaka...

412
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,375
Well, down the hatch!

413
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,000
[DARK ELF] Heh, heh, hey!
Big catch! Big catch!

414
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,541
One basket of cookies,
comin' up!

415
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,500
[SPARK]
Hold it, you cookie thief! Ahh!

416
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,416
Get... off... you...!

417
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll never let go of
these cookies, you thief!

418
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,333
Let go, I said!

419
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:49,958
No way!

420
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,458
I said let go!

421
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,708
And I said no!

422
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,541
[yelps]

423
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,000
Uh? I didn't think
the weather report said

424
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,416
it would be
raining cookies today.

425
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,916
Hey! Why did he get to eat
the cookies there, huh?!

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It' just ain't fair!

427
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
[SPARK]
Oh! Those precious cookies!

428
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,708
There goes my dream
of becoming a knight!

429
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,833
[DARK ELF]
Hey, hey! I'm outta here.

430
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,291
Oh, how could this happen?!

431
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,625
Now I'll never get
my own series!

432
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,041
I'll be a knight
in training forever!

433
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,083
[sniffs]
Hey, what's that smell?!

434
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
[NEESE]
The temperature's perfect!

435
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,250
This is so convenient.

436
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,000
With all the ingredients
and this little dragon here,

437
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,375
I can bake all
the cookies I want!

438
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,750
Thanks, Little Dragon!

439
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,375
All the cookies she wants?!

440
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,916
Then why am I even
on this mission?!

441
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,458
This bites...

442
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,416
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

443
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,000
[NEESE]
"Marfa, mother of the Earth.

444

Grant your miraculous
power to this young hero."

445
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,291
In the heat of the
battle to recover

446
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,125
the stolen crystal ball,

447
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:22,250
no one notices the approach
of another evil shadow.
