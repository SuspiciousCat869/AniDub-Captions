no matter what, Neese.

And I meant it.

So I won't give up.
I will get you out of here

want to lose you...

that I am the way she
belongs for all time.

I will never give up.

00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,375
[laughs]

167
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,958
[gasps]

168
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,625
[SPARK groans]

169
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,625
[MARFA]
Hero of Lodoss...

170
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,708
This holy girl answered
your feelings with her own.

171
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,958
Her divided self is now one.

172
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,583
That benevolence is one
of my basic teachings.

173
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,750
When Neese absorbed
Naneel into her body,

174
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,041
Neese's heart surrounded
the evil power,

175
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:08,041
and she sacrificed herself
to become a Doorway for me.

176
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,958
I can't believe it... Marfa...

177
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,125
[MARFA]
The danger of

178
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,958
the Destroyer's
resurrection has passed.

179
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,250
There are now two
choices open to you.

180
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:22,875
[SPARK]
Choices? I don't understand.

181
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,166
[MARFA]
I may use this girl's body

182
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,666
to be reborn into this world.

183
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
And as creator of Lodoss,

184
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:35,208
I can lead you all
into eternal peace.

185
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,541
Hero of Lodoss....

186
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,791
Do you wish for me to be reborn?

187
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:45,625
And if you should be reborn,
what happens to Neese?

188
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,958
[MARFA]
Once the Doorway is opened,

189
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,625
her body shall be destroyed.

190
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,958
The girl's soul shall be
taken to its rightful place

191
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,375
in the world of the gods.

192
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:02,500
In return, you may all enjoy
eternal peace and happiness.

193
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,833
What is your choice,
hero of Lodoss?

194
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:12,000
[SPARK] For Lodoss to finally
know peace is everyone's wish.

195
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,291
But I think that lasting peace
for Lodoss is something

196
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,625
that must be created
by those who live there.

197
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,708
So please, please
return Neese to us!

198
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,958
[MARFA]
Very well, then.

199
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,500
[SHIRIS]
Hmm? Ah?

200
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,916
What's that light?

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Marmo...

202
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,666
Thank you, Falis, for your
divine protection.

203
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,791
I can't believe it...

204
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,333
What's going on here?

205
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,458
[GARRACK groans]

206
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,625
[RYNA]
Huh...?

207
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,333
Garrack...?

208
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,125
[gasps] Hey, look at that!

209
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,958
[GREEVUS gasps]

210
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,333
[PARN]
Spark!

211
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,208
[DEEDLIT]
Neese!

212
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,958
Oh! Lady Neese! [sobs]

213
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:20,875
[NEESE groans softly]

214
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,041
Spark...?

215
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,666
You really did
come back for me...

216
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,083
Yes, Neese. That's right.

217
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,041
Welcome back, Neese.

218
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,875
[NEESE]
Thank you, Spark...

219
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,708
[MYCEN roars]

220
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,583
[inaudible]

221
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,000
Huh?

222
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,541
[PARN]
Mm...

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
[gasps]

224
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,666
[SPARK]
Heh...

225
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,375
[SPARK, NEESE laugh]

226
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,125
[NARRATOR]
The war was over.

227
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,166
The threat of Kardis
the Destroyer had passed.

228
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,250
And to Lodoss, once painted
in the hues of war,

229
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,375
light once again returned.

230
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,208
[NARRATOR] In recognition
of his accomplishments,

231
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,750
Parn, the heroic free knight,

232
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,916
was given the title
"Knight of Lodoss."

233
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,291
And a new knight was born as
peace overspread the land.

234
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,750
As long as brave, young people
stand ready to defend Lodoss,

235
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,833
the land will never
again know darkness.

236
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,958
[NARRATOR] To the south of
the continent of Alacrast

237
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,916
lies an island
known as "Lodoss."

238
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,291
Forged in the flames of war,

239
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,791
painted with the blood of
valiant and evil alike.

240
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:48,625
Yet, now there are none who
call it "the accursed island."

241
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,541
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

242
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,583
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

243
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,041
the grand finale!

244
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,250
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

245
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,375
[NEESE] Ain't that, like,
the cutest freakin' thing

246
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,250
you've ever seen?

247
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,000
All right! We made it here!

248
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,541
Spark...

249
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,083
[KASHUE] It looks like you've
completed your task, Spark.

250
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,750
You don't think...

251
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,291
Ain't that...?

252
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,583
Highness!
What're you doing here?

253
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,083
To celebrate the completion
of your mission,

254
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,375
everyone's here for
the cookie party.

255
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,750
[ALL cheer]

256
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,833
That's a really funny line,
yeah, the third one...

257
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,291
Huh?

258
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,125
[DARK ELF]
Hey, huh!

259
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,083
All right, you, too.

260
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,500
[DARK ELF]
Whoopty-doo! Who, me?

261
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,833
[sobs] Boo-hoo, there! Boo-hoo!

262
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,500
[KASHUE]
Well done, Spark.

263
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,250
[SPARK]
It was my pleasure, sir.

264
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,916
So, I heard that a few of your
trials were pretty tough...

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,708
...not!

266
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,041
[chuckles]

267
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,458
But you mastered each one
of them without fail.

268
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,041
That's why now...

269
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, boy! I'm gonna
become a real knight!

270
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,500
[KASHUE] I want to give
you your next assignment.

271
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,916
Yes! I am ready to
accept my next task.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,166
Congratulations, Spark!

273
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,791
[PARN]
For your next assignment!

274
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
Take these to the Bad-Ass Dragon

275
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,458
on the Ultimate
Mountain of Doom!

276
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,875
Ah!

277
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,791
It's all right! As long as
Neese is there to help me,

278
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,833
there's nothing I can't do!

279
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,708
You're out of your freakin' mind
if you think I'd trust you

280
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,458
with my freakin' daughter again!

281
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,708
Huh?!

282
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,041
Forgive me, Spark, but
I don't want to see you

283
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,666
turning out ordinary.
That's why...

284
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,958
...I'm keeping you
in training forever!

285
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,625
[ALL]
Jokes on you!

286
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,833
It's not funny!

287
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,291
Wah...

288
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,791
I really have the worst luck
in the world, don't I?

289
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,000
[screams]

290
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,583
[ALL]
See you around!
