The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

had split the continent,

--Dance!
--Uh-- Uh, w-wait!

Just relax.
Let's take it slowly.

Take it easy. Just relax.

That's it. Slowly. Slowly.

Ah, why, why, King Kashue!

[KASHUE] Ah, our brave
hero is so young.

Am I wrong? Or didn't you
come here to fight?

Yes, sir!

Why can't Falis
take it easy on me?!

[GHIM]
He's training.

Parn's been drinking in
the war fever around here.

I see.

Now don't swing
with your shoulders!

Use the strength in your hips!

Eh?

[KARLA chuckles]

225
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,791
My lord, Kashue.

226
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,583
Why, it's you!

227
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,333
Parn, do you know her?

228
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,000
She's that witch; the one who
tried to capture the princess!

00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,333
What?!

230
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:20,291
Aah, Kashue... Did you enjoy
my little diversion?

231
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,375
Do you mean that assassin?

232
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,791
Allow me to help you.

233
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,750
Lodoss depends on it.

00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,750
Don't trust her!

Very well, then. But you
take care and watch yourself

00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,500
because I will
be watching you...

mercenary king, Kashue.

Ah! He's here!

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,583
My name is Prince Jester,

248
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,583
and I must speak
to King Fahn at once!

249
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,583
[KASHUE]
Now then, Parn.

250
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,958
You say their army is made up
of more than just humans?

251
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,625
[PARN]
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,458
[JESTER] Your Highness,
we can confirm that as well.

253
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:17,083
What's worse, the northern
border of Valis has fallen.

254
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,500
Then all may be lost.

255
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,666
[FAHN] We'd best face
this situation calmly.

256
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,875
At first light, we will send
reinforcements to the front.

257
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,083
[ADVISORS]
Aye!

258
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,166
[JESTER]
Then we will make sure

259
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,375
the Valis garrison
is fully manned.

260
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,000
Our thanks to you.

261
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,541
King Fahn...

262
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,416
There is still something else
that needs to be discussed.

263
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,000
[FAHN]
Karla.

[KASHUE]
Yes, sire.

266
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,500
This witch, Karla,
is known to the Marmo.

267
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,875
But we cannot tell
what her true intentions are.

268
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,625
[ADVISOR A]
Karla...

269
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,916
Karla! The same name
is mentioned in the legends

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,833
of the Kingdom of Sorcery,
I'm certain.

271
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,250
A legendary witch?

272
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,833
Whatever the case,

273
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,958
we should assign someone to
investigate her more fully.

274
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,458
And soon.

275
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,833
The Great Sage, Wort,
must know something about her.

276
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,875
I'm sure he'll help.

277
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,416
Wort, you say?

278
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,083
But who among us would be able
to travel such a great distance?

279
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,666
[sighs] The journey is
certainly a perilous one.

280
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,625
Your Highness, if I may
make a suggestion.

281
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,166
What is it?

282
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,208
[KASHUE] For this task, I think
Parn would be most suitable.
