The crystal ball isn't here!

Any thief worth his
name would never hold on

They probably passed
the Soul Crystal Ball

00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,875
to someone else a while ago.

134

explain these guys?

lead us on a pointless chase.

00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,458
[bell tolls]

138
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,958
[RANDAL]
I see. Well done, Spark.

139
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,875
But don't look so sad.

140
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,625
You may not have
recovered the treasure,

141
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,958
but at least you took
care of the thieves.

142

Be proud of that.

143
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,875
But unless we recover
the Soul Crystal Ball,

144
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,625
our mission will
not be complete.

145
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,708
And because we fell for their
trick and killed them,

146
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,500
we have no chance of
finding the crystal now!

147
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,458
I'll send out a team of
our swiftest riders

148
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,500
to secure the latest
information from Akroyd.

149
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,625
Of course, Hiruto's defenses
will remain on high alert.

150
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,500
We will do all we can.

151
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,125
There is a real possibility
that the thieves passed along

152
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,875
the treasure somewhere in the
desert outside the city.

153
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,083
Perhaps there was a witness.

154
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,583
In any case, until we
have more information,

155
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,083
you should stay here
and get some rest.

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,958
[door shuts, footsteps]

166
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,208
I'll watch her now.

167
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,083
Why don't you go get some rest?

168
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,958
There's some food ready in
the other room, if you like.

169
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,625
Why thank you. I think I will.

170
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,958
[SPARK]
What should I do now?

171
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,583
Should I listen
to Governor Randal

172
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,708
and just wait here for news?

173
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,125
No, that's a big waste of time.

174
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,458
Maybe we should give up on

175
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,541
finding the crystal
ball for now,

176
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:29,041
and focus on getting King
Kashue's message to Valis.

177
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,833
But if I do that, then...

178
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,166
[RYNA groans]

179
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,791
[SPARK]
Huh?

180
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,416
Where... am I...?

181
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,208
Hey there. It's about
time you woke up.

182
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,500
[RYNA]
Spark?

183
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,416
You're safely inside
Governor Randal's mansion.

184
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,166
But how?
Didn't the Dark Elves...?

185
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,458
Neese performed one of her
magical healing spells on you.

186
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,000
She says you probably
won't even have any scars.

187
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,166
But for now, I think you'd
better get some rest.

188
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,333
It'll be a while before
you get your strength back.

189
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,208
[RYNA]
You're a very kind man, Spark.

190
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:08,125
It is a knight's sworn duty
to be kind to all ladies.

191
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,833
Even knights in training?

192
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,791
[SPARK]
Yes, even me.

193
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,666
I want to go and tell the
others that you're awake.

194
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,458
Everyone's been so
worried about you.

195
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,416
Wait!

196
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,708
Please, Spark.

197
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,916
[SPARK]
Hm?

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,541
There is something
very important

199
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,750
that I must discuss with you.

200
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,708
[SPARK]
Huh?

201
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,458
I wasn't honest with you before,
when I said I was a mercenary.

202
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,208
The truth is... I'm a thief...

203
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,458
[gasps]
A thief?

204
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,041
[RYNA] I can't tell you how
sorry I am for deceiving you

205
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,416
all this time.

206
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,791
But... if my colleagues
in Blade found out, well...

207
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,958
I should already
be marked for death.

208
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,291
That's why I kept things secret.

209
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,625
But my wanting to avenge
Randy's death is true!

210
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,500
Believe me!

211
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,458
So, do you think
any less of me now?

212
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,208
[SPARK]
Well, being a thief is bad.

213
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,708
It's certainly nothing
to be proud of.

214
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, it's better
than being a murderer.

215
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,166
[SPARK gasps]

216
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,416
[RYNA] Not everyone
can be as fortunate

217
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,666
as you have been, Spark.

218
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,875
When life's beaten
you down enough,

219
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,916
sometimes you've got to steal
and cheat just to survive.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,875
I wonder what you're
going to do with me now--

221
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,625
Perhaps send me away,
or will you throw me in jail?

222
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
I would never abandon you.

223
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,708
In fact, I was hoping that you'd
consider staying on with us.

224
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,583
[gasps]

225
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,791
Now, I can't force you to come.

226
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,250
And your life may be in
danger from time to time.

227
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,916
But if I'm going to recover
the Soul Crystal Ball,

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm going to need the
help of a clever thief.

229
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,541
[RYNA laughs]

230
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,541
Um. Uh. What is it?

231
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,291
So, you say you need
me because I'm a thief.

232
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,916
Is that the only reason?

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,833
Uh! Um... Well, uh--

234
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,625
You've also become a good
friend to all of us, too.

235
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,375
Uh... So perhaps you'd like
to stick around for that?

236
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,208
Good. Any other reason?

237
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,791
[SPARK]
Uh. No. That's it.

238
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
I'll go tell the
others that you're okay!

239
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,958
[RYNA]
Uh...

240
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,375
[door slams]

241
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,333

Ah! Mah!

[LEAF slurping]
Ahh!

244
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,583
There's nothing better than a
good meal after a good fight!

245

Heh!

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,250
[GARRACK]
Hm?

00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,500
Captain?

250
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,208
What's wrong, Spark?
Is Ryna all right?

251
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,958
She sure is. In more
ways than you know...

252
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,625
She's doing fine now!

253
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,875
[LEAF]
Really...?!

254
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,458
What are you
talking about, Leaf?

255
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,041
[LEAF]
Captain, you're blushing!

256
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,666
Uhh! Uh... You must
be imaging things!

257
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,250
No I'm not.

258
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,208
Well, it looks as if there's no
need reason to worry anymore.

259
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,583
[ALDO]
Lady Neese?

260
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,208
I'm going to bring Miss Ryna
something good to eat.

261
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,166
Her wounds have healed,
but she's lost a lot of blood.

262
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,000
What she needs
now is nourishment.

263
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,875
She's quite a girl,
that Lady Neese.

264
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah. She handles
herself really well.

265
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,291
Not a bit like our captain here.

266
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,250
Am I right?

267
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,166
Oh, shut up.

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,083

[WAGNARD] I've been
waiting for you, Doorway.

273
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,208
[NEESE]
You're...

274
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,250
[gasps]
You're Wagnard!

275
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,041
So, the young priestess
remembers my name.

276
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,333
I'm honored.

277
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,041
How dare you invade
my mind like this!

278
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,083
What are you trying
to do, Wagnard?!

279
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,791
Reviving Kardis the Destroyer

280
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,041
will annihilate
the entire world!

281
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,208
It's total madness!

282
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,375
[WAGNARD] Your feelings on the
matter are beside the point,

283
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,458
I'm sorry to say.

284
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:26,333
Neese, I need your body
to serve as the doorway.

285
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:30,583
Now, won't you please come along
with me to the dark island?

286
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,375
No! I refuse!
I have no intention

287
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,083
of helping you, Wagnard!

I can't get the door open!

I think I just did!

Just kill it already!

Kill? Now there's a thought!

313

[SPARK]
How did I manage to get us lost

314
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,666
in the Black Dragon's dungeon?

315
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,583
I bet this wouldn't happen
to a real knight of Flaim...

So they've fallen
right into my trap.

00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,125
A treasure chest?

324
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,333
[NEESE]
I hear you can find magic items

325
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,708
hidden around dungeons.

326
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,291
Maybe we can use it disembowel
the freakin' beast?

327
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,500
Let's check it out!

328
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,208
Little Dragon, we need
you to distract him

329
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,375
for a while. Now, go!

330
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,750
Well, here it is!

331
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,208
It's a legendary magic item!

332
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,208
[SPARK] Hold it right there,
Black Dragon!

333
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,833
I shall destroy you!

334
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,750
With the legendary magic item...

335
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,291
...the wig of Aphro!

336
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,583
[BLACK DRAGON laughing]

337
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,250
What's so funny?! Come on!

338
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:35,916
Huh?

339
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,625
[laughter continues]

340
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,166
I... I won...

341
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,708
But why do I feel
so empty inside...?

342
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,791
[DARK ELF, NEESE laugh]

343
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,166
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

344
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,041
[SPARK] Suddenly, we are
attacked by an evil storm!

345
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,125
And Neese's body is swept
into its dark power!

346
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,833
Could this be the dark
nightmare she spoke of?!

347
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,458
To save the suffering girl,

348
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,875
we must fight
an invisible enemy!

349
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,333
