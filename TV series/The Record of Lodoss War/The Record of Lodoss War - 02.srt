Oh, Slayn... Is he
doing any better?

He'll live, but he's been
through a terrible strain.

His body and his spirit

That poor man.

18
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,750
His soul has been possessed
by Hyuri, the spirit of anger.

19
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,125
It's amazing he's been
able to last this long.

Orson is suffering through

I only wish I had the power

to completely rid him
of this possession.

23
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:13,000
I would prefer not to have
anything to do with a berserker.

No matter how
skilled the shaman,

no one has ever been able to
drive away the spirit of Hyuri.

[CECIL]
I agree!

What are we supposed to do
if he goes berserk again?

I'd rather not make an enemy

beat with a sword.

30

And as for the enemies
I can beat, I, um--

00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,750
I make exceptions for dragons.

32
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,916
I think it's about
time you told us.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,208
What was it that
Neese said to you

34
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,333
at the temple of Marfa, Slayn?

35
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,666
All right, Parn.
You're entitled to understand.

36
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,708
And it's important for all
of you to understand

37
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,416
the mission we are
about to embark upon.

38
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,833
[LEYLIA]
We must begin our understanding

39
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,458
with the story of
the destruction

40
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,875
of the ancient kingdom
of Sorcery here in Lodoss.

41
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,333
Yes. It was 500 years ago...

42
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,375
The sorcerers of Lodoss had
brought honor and glory

43
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,750
to the ancient
kingdom of Kastuul.

44
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:15,125
Using their powerful sorcery,
they mastered the spirit world,

45
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,791
even making servants
of the dragons.

46
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,958
However, in their
quest to master

47
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,500
ever more powerful
forms of magic,

48
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,666
a group of them attempted
a grand magical experiment,

49
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
but failed miserably.

50
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,708
Their magic was sealed away,

51
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,500
and their holy land
was destroyed.

52
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,000
Now with their land in ruin,
and their powers gone,

53
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:40,333
the people of Kastuul were easy
prey for the barbarian tribes.

54
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,166
It was a bloody uprising.

55
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,125
[KARLA] How goes the battle,
Governor Saluvan?

56
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:52,708
Terribly. You and I are
the only nobles left alive.

57
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,666
The city is lost, Karla.

58
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,666
[KARLA]
So Kastuul has finally fallen

59
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,500
from its position of glory.

60
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,833
The last defenders
of the city of Kuudo

61
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,250
are the dragon's tooth warriors.

62
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,416
All we ever did was
abuse the barbarians.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,083
If only we had just manipulated
them as Marfa taught.

64
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,458
I can't believe you're
a follower of Marfa.

65
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,125
It's because of
heretics like you

66
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
that we've actually
lost this war.

67
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,125
Not true.

68
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,333
We were destroyed because
we relied so much on our magic

69
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,750
that we forgot our
limits as humans.

70
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,083
You cannot fight destiny.

71
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,500
When we die,

72
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,333
this city will most certainly
sink beneath the lake.

73
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,791
At least we'll take
the barbarians with us.

74
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,333
Still, it's ironic, isn't it?

75
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,708
So long ago, the gods were
destroyed by the dragons,

76
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,625
and we of the
kingdom of Sorcery,

77
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,875
who had the power to tame them,

78
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,500
have been destroyed
by petty barbarians.

79
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,333
And why don't I see any of our
precious dragons around here?

80
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,208
Perhaps if we had used them,

81
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,333
we might have postponed
our deaths a bit more.

82
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:04,000
They are flying to secret
hideaways throughout Lodoss,

83
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
charged with the
duty of protecting

84
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,166
the most precious
treasures of Kastuul.

85
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,083
Someday, the power of our
kingdom will surely be revived.

86
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,708
That day will come.

87
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,083
And we must make sure

88
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,375
the magic of the Governor's
Treasures is not lost.

89
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,916
How useless.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,750
In that case, I know now that
I must live on as I see fit.

91
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,500
This terrible destruction

92
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,541
must never be allowed
to happen again.

93
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,041
[SALUVAN]
So you'll commit your soul

94
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:36,625
to that circlet on your head?
Some immortality.

95
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,791
I pray that it's not your final
act as a sorceress, dear Karla.

96
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,000
For your sake,
I hope your plan works.

97
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,375
[SALUVAN chuckles]

98
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,250
[LEYLIA] After that,
Karla left to join the battle...

99
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,083
...and lost her life.

100
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,583
[LEYLIA] Then, through her
magical circlet,

101
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,875
she took the soul of the
barbarian who had killed her,

102
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,416
leaving the doomed city
of Kuudo behind her.

103
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,250
And that is all I know
about the ancient kingdom,

104
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,250
the only memory that Karla
has left inside of me.

105
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,125
[SLAYN] Now the most
important part of this story

106
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,375
is what Governor Saluvan did,

107
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,583
entrusting the five
ancient dragons

108
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,125
with what were known as
the Governor's Treasures,

109
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,541
and having them hidden in
places throughout Lodoss.

110
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,916
I've heard that story before!

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,208
A lot of adventurous people have
tried to find that treasure.

112
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
And somehow, they
all wind up dead.

113
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,833
But suppose that a man appeared
who is able to kill the dragons,

114
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,833
and suppose he claimed
the Governor's Treasures

115
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,041
for himself, what
would you think then?

116
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,833
If he was a man
with a just heart,

117
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,916
it would not be a problem.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,875
But if he was evil,
it could be a disaster.

119
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,416
[gasps] Hold on!

120
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,375
Are you telling us that such
a man has actually appeared?!

121
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,458
The ice dragon Bramd has
just been killed in his lair.

122
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,250
He was murdered at the hand
of the famous black knight

123
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,041
who seeks the treasure of
the Scepter of Domination.

124
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,416
And with it, the power to
control every living thing!

125
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,125
[gasps]

126
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,083
He's returned again, Parn.

127
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,000
It's Ashram.

128
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,416
Ashram...

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,375
[PARN]
I'll never forget him.

130
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,833
Back during the War of Heroes,

131
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,875
Ashram was the captain
of the royal guard

132
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,000
for Emperor Beld of Marmo.

133
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,166
Marmo?!

134
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,625
Oh, no way!

135
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,208
If a man like that
gets his hands

136
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,000
on the Scepter of Domination,
it would be a disaster!

137
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,541
[SLAYN] That's why we have to
get the Scepter of Domination

138
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,875
before Ashram does.

139
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,583
Even if it means we
have to fight a dragon.

140
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,333
[CECIL]
But wouldn't it be a lot easier

141
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,750
if we just kill this
Ashram guy instead?

142
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,041
I wish I could say yes.
But we're talking about a man

143
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,791
who made it to White
Dragon Mountain

144
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,583
and was able to
single-handedly kill Bramd.

145
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,250
And I'm afraid it's
almost a certainty

146
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,958
that he was able to kill the
evil dragon Narse on Marmo.

147
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,708
So you must make a choice as
to the more formidable foe:

148
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,875
Is it the dragon or
the dragon slayer?

149
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,708
Neither one is a
very good choice.

150
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,041
But this must be done.

151
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,916
If we were forced to
endure another war

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,625
like the War of Heroes,

153
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,083
then all of Lodoss would
surely turn to ashes.

154
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,500
By the way, Slayn,
do you have any idea

155
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,625
which dragon holds the
Scepter of Domination?

156
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,791
Well, since the dragon
riders of Moss

157
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,458
have no real
control over Lodoss,

158
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,083
I think it is safe to assume
that the king dragon Mycen

159
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,125
is not the one who
holds the scepter.

160
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,625
[PARN]
That leaves only two others.

161
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,375
[SLAYN] Yes. There's Shooting
Star of Fire Dragon Mountain,

162
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
and Abram,
of Blue Dragon Island.

163
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,750
One of them holds the scepter.

164
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,791
Can we rely on your help?
Brave Parn?

165
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,416
Of course, my friend.

166
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,916
We cannot allow ourselves
to fail in this endeavor.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We must devise a
most careful plan.

168
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,666
[PARN]
I have an idea, Slayn.

169
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,708
I think we should
travel to Flaim.

170
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,083
We should ask King Kashue
for his assistance on this.

171
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,291
Believe it or not,

172
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,833
I was just thinking
the same thing, myself.

173
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,208
The kingdom of Flaim
is directly on our path

174
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:32,125
to Fire Dragon Mountain,
as well as Blue Dragon Island.

175
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,500
Besides, I'm sure he'll help us.

176
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,041
Tomorrow, we will
set out for Flaim.

177
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,875
Prepare yourselves.
Destiny commands...

178
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,750
...and we must obey!

179
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,875
[NARRATOR]
At first light,

180
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,208
Parn and his party made final
preparations for their journey.

181
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,250
And with the sun
climbing into the sky,

182
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,583
they set out on the path to the
three desert kingdoms of Flaim,

183
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,291
leaving Zaxon village
far behind them.

184
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,458
Hyah!

185
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,458
Uh?! Whoa!

186
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,958
[PARN]
Shiris! Orson!

187
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,416
[SHIRIS]
It's not polite to leave

188
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,833
without saying
goodbye, Parn.

189
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,500
I still haven't paid you
back for saving my life.

190
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,750
Well, I-- I, um-- Ah...

191
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,125
I really appreciate
the thought, but please,

192
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,916
this just isn't the time.

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,666
Says who? I can repay a debt.

194
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,125
And that's the reason why
I've decided to come along

195
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,041
and help all of you in your
quest to kill that dragon!

196
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:04,875
[PARN]
Huh?

197
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,833
You're gonna what?!

198
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,000
[SHIRIS] Despite appearances,
I'm a pretty darn good fighter,

199
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,833
and I can be of use to you,
so let me come, Parn!

200
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,208
B-But--

201
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,125
I'm against it! Imagine!

202
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,250
Taking some girl who just rode
in from God knows where...

203
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,958
And besides, she's a
mercenary for Duke Raster!

204
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,083
That deal is history!
I'm on my own!

205
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,458
But I wonder if it's such
a good idea for the captain

206
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,833
of the self-defense force to
just up and leave the village.

207
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,666
The village will be protected
by the holy soldiers of Marfa

208
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,666
and the dwarf clan to the north!

209
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,875
Mind your own business!

210
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,791
And I'm still
against her coming!

211
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,958
Unfortunately, nobody asked you!

212
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,833
So shut up, you greenhorn!

213
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,958
What did you call me?!

214
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,750
[PARN] Enough! Both of you,
cut it out right now!

215
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,833
If you're going to pick fights,
you don't have to come!

216
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,041
Which means I can come as
long as I don't pick a fight.

217
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,375
Well, I guess...

218
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,291
Her actions since yesterday

219
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,250
have led me to place
trust in her word.

220
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,958
And... we need all the help
that we could possibly get.

221
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,416
[CECIL]
Master Slayn!

222
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,791
And you?

223
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,333
I think she--

224
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,333
Um, whatever you
think is best, Parn.

225
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,791
[PARN]
All right, you can come.

226
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,291
But don't do anything rash.
This is really dangerous.

227
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,208
I knew you'd agree!

228
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,708
And don't worry!

229
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,458
Facing a strong enemy just
encourages me to fight harder!

230
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,250
[PARN chuckles]

231
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,625
[gasps]

00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,875
[growls]

233
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,666
I want to say thank you.
For healing me.

234
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,583
Sure.

235
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,916
Just a minute!

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,208
Who said the berserker
could come along?

237
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,166
Orson and I are partners!

238
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,833
We've been working
together for many years.

239
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,791
Do I look worried to you?

240
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
But Slayn...

241
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,291
Deedlit...

242
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,000
Suppose I told you that he
was my very good friend,

243
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,375
would you agree to let
him come along then?

244
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,375
[gasps]

245
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,000
[PARN] Do you remember
Leylia's story from last night?

246
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,250
[SHIRIS]
Mm-hm.

247
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,333
Well, she left out one
very important detail.

248
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,500
[SHIRIS]
What is it?

249
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,625
She didn't mention the fact
that Karla, the Grey Witch,

250
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,041
is still alive.

251
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,500
And she's taken one
of my old friends.

252
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:26,000
Woodchuck was a bad thief,
but a good friend.

253
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,583
Karla's power and personality

254
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,125
are sealed in
that golden circlet.

255
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,791
Whoever wears it becomes
possessed by her.

256
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,625
Drifting from body to body
throughout the centuries,

257
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:41,541
she's been able to achieve
her coveted immortality.

258
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,916
And so, she continues
to be responsible

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
for all the war and all
the chaos in Lodoss.

260
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,250
But why? Why does she cause it?

261
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
The kingdom of Sorcery
destroyed itself.

262
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,625
All because of its pursuit
of absolute power.

263
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,041
Karla believes that by
shifting the power base

264
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,333
between the kingdoms,

265
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,666
she can ensure eternal
prosperity for Lodoss.

266
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,875
But that means that the War
of Heroes five years ago...

267
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,083
[PARN] Right. Karla
controlled the whole thing.

268
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,166
And the body that held
the circlet back then was...

269
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,541
Oh, no! You mean--?

270
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,583
[PARN] Leylia is desperate to
atone for the chaos she caused

271
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,208
while her body was
under Karla's control.

272
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,458
Even to the point of enduring
a dangerous journey

273
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,875
to help avoid a war.

274
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,375
Or like saving a warrior

275
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,083
whose heart is controlled
by the spirit of anger.

276
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,916
Boy, you've got a big
mouth, Mr. Free Knight.

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,666
Besides, look.

[CECIL sighs]

00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,500
Come, we must hurry onward.

280
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,250
It's vital that we cross
the mountains

281
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,791
and get ourselves to Flaim
as quickly as we can.

282
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
You're so right.

283
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,166
[PARN]
To protect the land of Lodoss,

284
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,500
I have to get to King
Kashue as fast as I can!

285
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,208
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
just outside of Blade,

286
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,333
the capital of the desert
kingdom of Flaim,

287
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,291
Hobb, priest of
the War God Myrii,

288
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,958
is visited at the temple
by a company of strangers

289
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,083
clad in thick, black armor.

290
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,416
I'll ask you one more time!

291
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,208
You honestly expect
that I would abandon the post

292
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,375
given me by King Kashue

293
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,750
to help you and your
knights of Marmo?

294
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,750
For a priest of the war god,

295
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,708
is there no greater honor
than to teach brave knights

296
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,625
to be more powerful?

297
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,416
Help me. I need the
power you possess.

298
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,416
I can't believe
that you would dare

299
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,583
to put yourself on a level
with King Kashue.

300
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,791
It's exactly where I belong.

301
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,250
[HOBB]
Ridiculous!

302
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,375
King Kashue is a true hero!

303
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,125
It was he who helped
kill Emperor Beld

304
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,708
in the War of Heroes!

305
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,125
And so, he thinks only
of his own kingdom,

306
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,541
not caring about the condition
of those around it.

307
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that your definition
of a "true hero"?

308
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,541
[gasps]

309
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,250
Marmo was destroyed in a war.

310
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,125
No one will deny that.

311
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,791
But Emperor Beld had a
dream of uniting Lodoss,

312
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,833
and that dream
still lives within me.

313
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,250
Kashue's contentment
with only ruling Flaim

314
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,166
is proof that he is nowhere
near the man Beld was!

315
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,500
[gasps]

316
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,916
So who really deserves
the title of "true hero"?

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,791
The priests of Myrii
call themselves

318
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,583
the "Seekers of Heroes," right?

319
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,333
You should know the answer.

320
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
[HOBB]
But Beld is dead now.

321
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,666
And there's no way
anyone can prove that!

322
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,250
That's a simple matter.

323
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,666
Kashue is mine. I'll conquer
Flaim and become king!

324
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,458
I will carry on for Beld.
His dream lives!

325
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,041
For I hold in my
hand the instrument

326
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,333
that will make me
worthy of such glory!

327
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,250
You will see this for
yourself in the near future.

328
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,375
[laughing]

329
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,875
[NARRATOR]
Four days later,

330
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,666
Parn and his party
arrived in Flaim.

331
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,458
And the priest Hobb

332
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,625
vanished from his post
at the temple of Myrii.

333
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,416
--Welcome...
--...to Lodoss Island!

334
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,125
What you've all been
waiting for...

335
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,166
...the second part!

336
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,083
[giggles]

337
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,541
Hi there! You can
call me Deedlit!

338
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,583
I love nature! I'm friends
with all the spirits.

339
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,958
I'm a high elf!

340
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,041
[giggles]

341
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,958
And... I'm the cutest
girl in the world.

342
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,666
Piling it on a little thick,
eh, little Deed?

343
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,041
Of course, my long ears
are very lovely,

344
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:28,083
along with my waist, my bust,
and of course, my shapely hips.

345
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,000
And my age is a secret!

346
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:31,916
Big deal.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,250
Just 'cause she's a high elf,

348
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,250
she acts like she's a
princess or something!

349
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,541
Oh, Deed...

350
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,666
I don't know what he sees
in that older woman.

351
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
Having an older girlfriend

352
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,083
is really quite
fashionable nowadays.

353
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,250
Older?!

354
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,083
You mean you didn't know?

355
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,750
Even though elves
look really young...

356
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,666
...they actually age much
faster, so she's really--

357
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,625
[screams]

358
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,125
[PARN]
160 years old?!

359
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,208
That is why I said...

360
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,291
...my age is a secret!

361
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,250
Anyway, using my very own
shamanistic magic,

362
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,416
I will help to defend
the one I love!

363
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,291
Yay!

364
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
[DEEDLIT]
And now...

365
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:23,166
[PARN cheers]

366
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,041
And now, folks!

367
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,000
Presto! Just kidding!

368
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,750
[DEEDLIT laughing]

369
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,500
Love that shamanistic magic!

370
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,833
[GROUP groans]

371
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,625
Yes! I will keep trying!

372
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,166
[PARN grunting]

373
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,791
[SLAYN]
Are you really sure we should be

374
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,833
traveling with this guy?

375
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,666
Never bring that up either!

376
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,291
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

377
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,333
[PARN] Now reunited with our
old comrade, King Kashue,

378
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:16,416
we decide to take on Shooting
Star, the fire dragon, together!

379
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
At a glittering party
before our adventure,

380
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,458
the king presents an
unexpected proposal.

381
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,708
Next time, on
<i>Record of Lodoss War</i> :

00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,958
<i>Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:</i>
