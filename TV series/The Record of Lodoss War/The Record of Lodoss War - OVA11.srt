[NARRATOR]
Light and darkness...

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,666
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,333
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

[NARRATOR] The narrow
victory in the seemingly

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,958
hopeless battle with
the demon dragon,

28
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,541

created a joyous uproar

29
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,583
in Flaim's royal
castle of Akrohd.

30
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,916
And news of the safe
return of King Kashue,

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,083
who had been
given up for dead,

32
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,958
was cause enough for the
battle-weary soldiers to forget,

33
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:39,583
for a moment, the ominous
events brewing in Marmo.

What's wrong?

00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,458
That's what I hate
about you, Orson.

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,500
I thought by now you'd know
what not to ask me.

53
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:38,250
After all, how many years
have we been together?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,250
[KASHUE]
Marmo?

55
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,000
Aye. With Ashram dead,
we just assumed that Marmo

56
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,458
would revert to the dark
island it used to be, but...

57
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,416
[KASHUE]
Hmm?

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,541
How can I describe it?

59
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,625
It's as if all of Marmo
bristles with some new force.

60
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,916
What?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,916
Sometimes the earth
shakes and growls

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,791
like some great and evil beast.

63
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,375
And even the creatures
who live there

64
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,583
seem to be tormented and afraid.

65
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,083
Afraid?

66
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,500
Of what?

to fulfill your purpose.

My purpose?

Wagnard?

79
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,041
[VOICE] He has no intention
of following you.

80

[ASHRAM]
Huh. That is no surprise.

81

[VOICE]
The Scepter of Domination.

Wagnard's real intent?

I imagine even Kardis
would have to submit to it.

Who the devil are you?

86

[VOICE] The demon sword,
Soul Crusher.

It would appear
you've mastered it.

88
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,791
But will it serve you
against Kardis?

89

[ASHRAM]
What are you saying?

90
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,750
[VOICE]
The boy known as Parn.

00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,916
He will surely come
to Marmo as well.

That kid, Parn.

Why, it's you!

Return to Marmo.

All Lodoss must now
go there as well.

[PARN] You want me to carry this
message to the people of Moss?

97
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,166
[KASHUE] Shadam will go
to Raiden. We must gather

98
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,083
all the forces of
Lodoss for this task.

99
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,541
The Marmo... They must have
the Scepter of Domination.

100
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,208
The Scepter of Domination?

101
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,291
Legends say that whoever holds

102
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,208
the Scepter of
Domination rules Lodoss.

103

Oh, come on, Deed.

104
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,583
With Ashram and Beld dead,
no one's left.

105
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,958
[KASHUE] No.
Something else is going on.

106
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,541
Something's changing on Marmo.

107
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,625
You mean like long-scattered
forces uniting again?

108
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,291
Well, count me out. This stuff
sounds like nonsense.

109
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,416
Legends has it that
Kardis the Destroyer

110
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,625
still sleeps beneath
the dark island of Marmo.

[PARN] Karids? Resurrected
on the island of Marmo?

114

If it's true, we're too late.

So this is the Scepter
of Domination.

119
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,375
The power is mine.
Not even Kardis

120
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,166
can overcome
the power of the scepter.

[chuckles]

122
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,916
Now Lodoss will be yours
to control, Lord Wagnard.

[LEYLIA sighs]

00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,250
You should save those feelings
of concern for Lodoss.

00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,625
Leylia.

137
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,833
[LEYLIA] I really should be
travelling there alone.

138
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:06,708
But Slayn... I'm glad
you're here with me.

139

If things were not so grave,

140
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,958
I'd be able to say the many
things I'd like to.

Ah... It can't be!

00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
Here, we part company.

146
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,708
Don't get your
hopes up about Raiden.

147
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,416
A free city with no leader.

148
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,000
They couldn't care less about
outsiders or other kingdoms.

149
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,333
We aren't outsiders.

150
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,583
After all, Raiden is
part of Lodoss, too.

151
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,416
Listen to me,
if you're not a friend

152
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,750
or a threat,
you're an outsider.

I guess that's how
you mercenaries think.

Yup! That's why we're
bowing out of this job.

Eh, Orson?

[SHADAM] Go where you will, but
as long as you oppose Marmo,

157
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,916
our paths will
surely cross again.
