We've got two mercenaries here

appeared to be Dark Elves.

They aren't citizens
of Flaim, though...

[SPARK] Eyewitnesses?! We've got
to speak to them right now.

You can't be serious.

My point is, I'm hungry.

And now I'm going to
sit and enjoy a meal.

[LEAF] But first,
I wanna get washed up.

Hey, who's the captain here?!

How did I ever get
stuck with those two?

Don't get so mad.

63
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,208
This is the way mercenaries are,

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,250
so they can be ready
to fight at any time.

65

So this is how
mercenaries usually act?!

Yes. Most of them.

Well, I shouldn't have
to put up with that!

You've got to
get over it, Spark.

These people are your comrades.

70
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,250
Comrades or not, they should
still respect their captain.

Elves as quickly as possible!

will not be a pleasant one.

But as long as you have comrades
who will help you fight,

I know you will find your star.

Once they left the desert,

they probably used the

00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,958
Oh, Randy... I hope
you're in a better place.

326
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,000
I swear. I will
avenge your death.

327
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,208
[inhales]

328
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,083
I will join them.

329
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,208
L-Lady Neese! What are
you doing here?!

330
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,791
You know her, Aldo?

331
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,041
Could that be it...? Oh...

332
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,958
Hey! Aldo!

333
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,416
[ALDO]
Uh. This is Lady Neese,

334
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,750
the daughter of Slayn,
the great wizard.

335
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,708
But I didn't even know that
Master Slayn had a daughter.

336
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,875
You've got a special name.

337
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,833
My grandmother was
a High Priestess

338
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,833
and one of the Six Heroes.

339
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,625
I was given my
name to honor her.

340
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208
I see.

341
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,666
I would like to thank you for
helping to save us back there.

342
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,583
That was the will of Marfa,
the Goddess of the Earth.

343
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,166
Uh. By the way, what are you
doing out here all by yourself?

344
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,708
It is the will of the gods.

345
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,000
I am following a dark nightmare.

346
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

347
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:00,083
And now, what you've been
waiting for, the second part!

348
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,416
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

349
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,333
[SPARK]
Under orders from King Kashue,

350
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,791
I'm protecting Neese!
The granddaughter of... Uh...

351
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,083
Neese! One of the Six Heroes.

352
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,291
Along the way,
a gang of evil monsters

353
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,250
springs up to block our path!

354
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,416
But I won't lose! I am Spark,
knight of Flaim!

355
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,791
[yells]

356
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,541
[shouts]

357
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,791
[EVIL MONSTERS]
Ouch.

358
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,041
[SPARK] Well, at least the
introduction sounds cool,

359
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,666
but so far my duties as a
knight have been pretty lame.

360
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,958
Don't trip the trap, Spark!

361
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,625
[SPARK]
Huh? Ahh!

362
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,833
Heads up!

363
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,125
[SPARK muffled grumbles]

364
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,041
Oh, my. Ain't that a nice cake!

365
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,583
Hey! Who the heck
set this trap?!

366
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,750
Delish! Whoever made
this must be really d--

367
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,875
[screaming]

368
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,583
Yes. It's the sweet
trap of the Dark Elf...

369
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,208
Right there!

370
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,375
So, you finally noticed me.

371
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,833
It's the Dark Elf
with the sweet tooth!

372
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,333
You set that trap!

373
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,958
You better give me
those cookies there

374
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,500
if you want to make it
out of this forest alive.

375
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,458
Otherwise, you'll both be
drowning in sweet traps, huh?

376
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh yeah?! I'll get you before--

377
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,125
[yelps]

378
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:20,958
[screaming]

379
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,041
Had enough there, cookie head?

380
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,500
Damn you!

381
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,250
Let's try some.

382
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,166
[DARK ELF]
Huh...?

383
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,166
They suck!

384
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,875
Your oven was too hot!

385
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,708
I can taste how hard you tried,
and the effort you put in!

386
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,291
But they still suck!

387
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,541
Huh...?! I'll try it again!

388
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,583
It's the will of Marfa.

389
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,041
[squawks]

390
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,416
Get these things... off me!

391
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,708
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seeing you!

392
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,250
[SPARK] The journey of the
mysterious girl, Neese,

393
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,291
has begun.

394
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,083
I don't know what her goal is,

395
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,791
but my mission is quite clear!

396
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,500
Catching up with the Dark Elves,

397
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,791
we confront them in
an attempt to recover

398
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,208
the stolen crystal ball!

399
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,833
