That's impressive. The Moss

The reason for the wars?

[KARLA]
It is power.

142
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,000
People attack other kingdoms,
expand their dominion,

143
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,916
and gain power as a result.

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,958
And then they dream of
gaining even more power,

00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,166
only for themselves.

146

And they continue, not knowing
where their path will lead.

It doesn't have to
end in destruction.

[LEYLIA]
He's right.

149

It's true that the great
sorcerers of the ancient kingdom

150
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,625
of Kastuul were destroyed
by their own lust for power.

151
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,958
That's because they forgot
about their limits as people.

152
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,125
But that was only
one possible result.

[SLAYN] Yet, for you,
it was the only result.

What the...?

162
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,625
No kingdom gets more powerful.

163
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,833
In fact, many just
get destroyed.

164
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,250
All I have done has been
for the sake of Lodoss.

165
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,750
There is no good or evil.

166
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,625
No light or darkness.

167
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:16,083
There is only grey. And that
is where the balance exists.

168
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,333
And now you have become
far too powerful.

169
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,833
And that is a problem.

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,083
You think we have upset
the balance of power,

173
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,500
and so, you've been trying
to eliminate us

landed here on Marmo.

But why, Karla? Don't you know

that Wagnard is trying
to revive Kardis?

177
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,083
If you kill us and
he is successful,

178

then all of Lodoss
will be destroyed.

So why are you doing this?

You are correct in your
assumption, High Elf.

You need not fear any

or if the united armies of
Lodoss succeed in defeating you,

one thing is certain:

Tomorrow, the kingdom we know
as Marmo will cease to exist.

I do not wish to run,
but as a general of Marmo,

224

I must protect my people.

inherit their desires.

I shall lead the people
of Marmo to a new land,

and there, I shall build
an entirely new kingdom.

But a kingdom of the dead
can never be destroyed.

A kingdom of the dead is one
that I can possess forever!

00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,500
all for his beloved Neese.

320
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,291
He looked here...
He looked there...

321
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,166
He looked everywhere.

322
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,416
Oh! Here, look!

323
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,333
[DEEDLIT]
Finally, Spark reached the place

324
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,333
where the Lodso fruit grows.

325
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,541
[SPARK panting]

326
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,500
[NEESE whines]
Lodso fruit!

327
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,583
[screams]

328
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,958
[panting]

329
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,916
Lodso fruit...

330
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,208
[gasps] Holy cow! Lodso fruit!

331
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,958
Hey, Neese! I found some! Look!

332
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,333
[NEESE] Hey, what freakin'
kept you, Spark?

333
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,000
Where'd you go? I was tryin'
to freakin' tell you

334
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,625
they were right outside.

335
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,250
[SPARK screams]

336
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,125
Hey, what's wrong?

337
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,458
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seeing you!

338
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,541
[SPARK] The Destroyer's
resurrection is at hand.

339
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,250
Where are you, Neese?!

340
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,333
As we enter the
castle of Conquera,

341
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,708
the black knight Ashram
appears before us once again.

342
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:22,291
Parn and Ashram conclude their
twisted destinies as always,

343
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,041
with swords drawn.
