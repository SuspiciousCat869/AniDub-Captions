Calm down... Just calm down!

He may be a Dark Elf,
but he's alone!

00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,916
If it's a one-on-one fight,
even I can handle it!

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,250
Careful! He can make himself
disappear with his magic.

6
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,500
But if I can slash him
before he gets the chance,

00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,000
I can beat this guy!

00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,791
And if I do, they'll have
to make me a knight!

they all come from?

There's no way I can win.

What should I do?!

If I turn my back
on them, I'm dead!

What's going on, Slayn?

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,500
I was afraid this would happen.

58
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,541
Highness!

59
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,041
We're searching
the castle grounds,

60
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,708
but there's no sign of them.

61

That can't me!

62
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,208
We sealed the gates right away.

63
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,625
They must be somewhere
on the castle grounds!

64
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,000
Highness! If they
really were Dark Elves,

65
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,583
they could have made
themselves invisible

66
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,125
and walked right past us.

00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,500
Shamanist magic!

68
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,791
But what were
they after, Slayn?

69
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,500
The tools...
The Destroyer's tools.

70
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,041

you talking about?

[SLAYN]
It has begun...

How is Spark doing?

00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,833
[GUARD A]
Priest Greevus is administering

76
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,416

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,875
He told me that
Spark should survive.

78
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,666
[KASHUE] As soon as he is able,
have him report to my chambers.

79
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,250
[GUARD A]
Yes, sir!

80
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,125
Parn and Deedlit,
you'd better come with me.

81
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,125
[KASHUE]
I will explain the situation

82
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,333
to the two of you directly.

83
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,458
But no one else
may know of this.

84
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,458
If our soldiers or
citizens find out,

85
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,541
it would cause
widespread panic in Flaim.

86
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,625
[SLAYN] I will tell you
everything we know.

87
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
We've learned that the Marmo

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,958
have just embarked
on a terrible plan.

89
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:06,208
What sort of plan? Tell us.

90
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,500
The resurrection of Kardis.

91
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,583
The Goddess of Destruction?!

92
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,416
But why would anyone wanna
do something like that?

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,166
Kardis has been sealed
away for centuries!

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,083
Ever since the
creation of Lodoss!

95
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,041
Yes, you're right, Deed.

96
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,375
Kardis was one of the goddesses

97
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,708
responsible for the
creation of Lodoss.

98
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,416
During the War of the Gods,

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,916
the forces light fought
against the forces of darkness.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,916
And Marfa, the Goddess
of the Earth,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,833
engaged Kardis the Destroyer

102
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,041
in a ferocious battle
of supreme heroism.

103
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,583
[SLAYN] In the end, Marfa used
her power to seal Kardis away.

104
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,541
But before Marfa could finish,

105
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,791
Kardis put a terrible
curse on the land.

106
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,250
[SLAYN]
Then Marfa,

107
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,708
already mortally
wounded from her battle,

108
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,375
used the last of her strength
to perform a miracle.

109
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,041
[SLAYN]
To save the continent,

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,166
she split the cursed
land away from it!

111
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,375
[SLAYN] And that
cursed land... is Lodoss.

112
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,458
But what will they accomplish?

113
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,916
If Kardis comes back,
the whole world will end.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,208
They'd be better off
resurrecting Falaris,

115
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,875
the God of Darkness.

116
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,916
All we can do now is pray that
the Marmo aren't madmen.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,708
So who is behind this?

118
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,958
The dark priests?

119
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,833
The leaders of
the Dark Elf tribe?

120
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,458
No. As far as I know, Parn,

121
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,750
there is only one
person in Marmo

122
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,208
who could actually
make this plan happen.

123
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,083
[DEEDLIT]
You mean...

124
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,833
It can be no one else but him!

125
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,291
[WAGNARD] "Nadeera...
Nani iru vey Kardis...

127
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,041
It shall come!
Oh, it shall come!

128
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,791
The time of your
resurrection is near.

129
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,750
And the Destroyer's tools
that were stolen, Slayn.

130
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,000
They have something to do
with Kardis's resurrection?

131
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:12,291
Yes. "Two keys, one door, and
Kardis shall awaken once more."

132
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,875
[PARN]
Is that some old legend?

133
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,083
[SLAYN]
The two keys are the two tools.

134
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,541
The one door is a live sacrifice
for the advent of Kardis.

135
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,541
When these three things
are brought together,

136
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,458
Kardis is reborn.

137
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,750
The Dark Elves
stole one of them.

138
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,958
It was the Soul Crystal Ball.

139
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,833
The Soul Crystal Ball?

140
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,000
That's what we recovered after
we won the battle with Ashram!

141
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,500
When the battle was over,

142
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,791
I took it from Maar and stored
it in the treasure house.

143
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,500
And what is the
other tool, Slayn?

144
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,500
It is called the Staff of Life.

145
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,708
And it is stored in
the temple of Falis.

146
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,166
That's their next target!

147
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,958
Calm down, Parn.

148
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,208
We will attack the
Marmo and stop them.

149
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,333
--[PARN] But--
--Don't worry.

150
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,708
I'll send a
dispatch to warn Valis.

151
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,208
King Etoh will be able to
provide additional protection

152
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,000
for the Staff of Life.

153
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,666
Leave the right job
to the right people.

154
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,791
The king is right. We can trust
Etoh to handle this, Parn.

155
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm ordering a pursuit
team out after them.

156
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,916
If my men can retrieve
the Soul Crystal Ball,

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,333
then there will be
nothing to worry about.

158
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,458
In that case, Highness,
I have a favor to ask.

159
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,875
[KASHUE]
Hm?

160
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,916
[SPARK] It's Spark, Your
Highness. Reporting as ordered.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,375
Enter!

162
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,541
[KASHUE]
Why, Spark?

163
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Why didn't you sound
the alarm immediately?

164
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,166
[SPARK]
I beg your pardon, Highness?

165
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,375
Why did you wait
to sound the alarm?!

166
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,833
I thought-- I thought that
I could beat him myself.

167
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
If I beat him,
it would've proven to you

168
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,708
that I was ready to be a knight.

169
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,458
That's what I thought, anyway...

170
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,458
I fully expect to be punished.

171
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,833
And you shall.

172
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,541
You are to join the pursuit.

173
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,083
Wait in the guard
room for my orders.

174
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,458
[MAN A] Did you hear? It sounds
like a big battle is brewing.

175
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:25,000
[MAN B] The king is ready for
a showdown with the Marmo.

176
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,250
I haven't seen any fighting
in almost ten years.

177
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,208
I was beginning to think I
might never go to war again.

178
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,416
[MAN C]
I know what you mean.

179
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,958
I heard those
intruders last night

180
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,958
were actually Marmo agents.

181
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,625
[MAN D] Yeah, and they
got away with some

182
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,916
valuable treasure, too!

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,166
Those guards
must've been asleep!

184
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
They should've called for help--

185
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,333
[CAPTAIN]
Quiet down, men!

186
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,583
[gasps]

187
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,291
Here are your assignments.
Listen up!

188
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,416
Sir Farus, report to
Fortress 12 in the west!

189
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,333
Sir!

190
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,791
[CAPTAIN]
Sir Bohnu and Sir Dagral

191
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,333
will go to Fortress 18
in the north.

192
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,791
[BOTH]
Sir!

193
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,666
[CAPTAIN]
Sir Tahgi and Sir Rudolf,

194
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,625
Fortress 8 in the east!

195
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,083
[BOTH]
Sir!

196
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,666
[ALDO] None of the other
treasures were even touched.

197
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,125
The only thing they took
was the Soul Crystal Ball...

198
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,291
[ALDO]
And even though Slayn

199
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,958
cast a strong
protection spell on it,

200
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,708
they managed to steal the
crystal with no effort at all.

201
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,250
[SLAYN]
It seems the intruders had

202
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,875
a powerful sorcerer among them.

203
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,000
[ALDO]
Master Slayn!

204
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,416
I beg your forgiveness,
Master Slayn.

205
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,708
Securing this place
was my responsibility.

206
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,625
Stop. This was not
your fault, Aldonova.

207
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,333
I was the one who cast
the protection spell here.

208
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,708
If someone
deserves blame, it is I.

209
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,375
But sir, the door.
What about the door?

210
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,000
The door is safe.

211
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,416
Thank goodness...

212
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,708
Then you must allow me to
protect the door, Master,

213
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,458
even with my li--

214
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,416
While I appreciate
your intentions,

215
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,125
I cannot allow it.

216
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
But why, Master?

217
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,666
[SLAYN]
Because, Aldonova,

218
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,291
I have a different
favor to ask of you.

219
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,333
[CAPTAIN] Sir Carlberos, report
to Fortress 6 in the south.

220
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,500
Sir!

221
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,166
[SPARK]
But Captain, wait! Please!

222
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,541
[CAPTAIN]
What?!

223
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,875
Uh... Please, sir, you forgot
about my assignment.

224
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,125
[CAPTAIN]
Your assignment?!

225
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,708
[SPARK] The king ordered
me to wait here until

226
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,541
he decided what my
assignment would be!

227
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,166
[CAPTAIN] Well, I haven't
heard anything about it.

228
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,083
[SPARK]
I see, sir...

229
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,208
[door opens, closes]

230
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,708
[sighs]

231
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,333
[growls]

00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,208
[knocking]

233
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,750
[SPARK]
Huh?

234
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,083
[GARRACK] I'm looking for an
idiot gloryhound named Spark,

235
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,125
the guy who let
the intruders escape.

236
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
I happen to be that idiot.

237
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,625
I just got my orders
from Lord Shadam.

238
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,833
As of today, you are my captain.

239
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm a mercenary,
and Garrack is my name.

240
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,833
Because of this thing here,

241
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,708
most people call me
the Blue Meteor.

242
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,541
You can if you want.

243
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,333
Well, whatever the case,
it's good to meet you.

244
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,458
Hold on there! What do you mean?

245
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,416
Your captain? Is this-- Hey!

246
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,625
I'm supposed to be
under punishment!

247
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,166
Don't joke around!

248
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,083
E-Ease up! Just calm down!

249
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,666
[LEAF]
Oh no! Don't tell me

250
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,791
I'm hooked up with
you again, Garrack.

251
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,291
[GARRACK gasps]
Leaf!

252
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,875
Oh, man! I knew there was
something wrong with this job!

253
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,208
I should be saying
the same thing!

254
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,000
[SPARK growling]

255
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,125
Hey! This is no place
for a woman or a child!

256
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,500
[LEAF]
Oh.

257
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,708
[yelps]

00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,208
[LEAF]
Outta my way, pal!

259
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,875
So, Garrack, you know
who our captain is?

260
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,875
[GARRACK]
Uh...

261
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,125
[LEAF]
Huh?

262
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,458
You're kidding, right?

263
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,375
Hey, do you think I
should apologize to him?

264
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,916
I think you know the game.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
Or at least you should by now.

266
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,000
If you make a good impression,
you know you'll get paid.

267
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,958
Why you... What did
you do that for?!

268
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,291
Oh, forgive me. Um, I had no
idea you were the captain here.

269
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,916
Uh, my name is Leaf,
and I'm a Half-Elf.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,291
I'm a mercenary,
just like Garrack here.

271
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,708
How do you do?

[PARN]
Is Spark in here?

276
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,000
[SPARK] Another one?
Just great... Now who wants--

277

[gasps]

278
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,625
[SPARK]
H-Highness!

279
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,125
Are you ready to
receive your orders?

280
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,791
[SPARK]
Yes, sir!

281
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,916
You shall deliver this dispatch
to King Etoh of Valis.

282
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,708
You are to leave at once.

283
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,416
[SPARK]
Huh?

284
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,875
Now listen carefully.

285
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,791
We've received word that the
intruders from last night

286
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,041
have fled to the
south toward Valis.

287
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,375
I have chosen a special pursuit
team that you will command.

288
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,041
Your mission is to recover
the stolen treasure,

289
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,958
the Soul Crystal Ball.

290
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,333
Huh?

291
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,291
Highness, does this mean my
honor has been restored?

292
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,291
Don't get too hasty, Spark!

293
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,500
The kingdom of Flaim
is in a state of war,

294
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,625
and you are still a
knight in training.

295
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,708
I do not expect
you to return here

296
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,625
until your mission is complete.

297
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,416
Yes, sir!

298
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,291
You can count on me!

299
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,916
[DEEDLIT giggles]

300
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,166

Priest Greevus!

302
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,333
Here, kid, you forgot something.

303
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,208
You can't expect to go
on a mission without it.

00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,458
Thank you, sir!

305
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,458
Ah... My sword.

306
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,916
Your Highness, I'd like
to ask your permission

307
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,458
--to accompany them.
--[GROUP gasps]

308
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,500
Greevus... It's all right
with me, but why?

309
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,291
Because I like this kid.

310
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,416
Do I really need a reason?

311
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,916
He left his sword behind while

312
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,333
he was trying to
escape the enemy.

313
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,250
In my mind, that takes a
special kind of courage.

314
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,416
Greevus...

315
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,125
Even the bravest of knights
forgets that a sword is a tool.

316
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,625
Some even value their sword
more than their own lives.

317
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,166
But the God of War has taught me
a different standard of courage.

318
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,583
Isn't that right, Miss?

319
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,166
[DEEDLIT]
Huh? Hmph.

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,625
Are you sure, sir?

321
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,666
It's all right.

322
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,083
My faith in the
God of War is all

323
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,333
that I need to ensure my safety.

324
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,041
Highness, is this everyone
who will be coming along?

325
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,958
[KASHUE]
One more will be coming as well.

326
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,666
It looks like he's late.

327
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,000
Then there's time.

328
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,041
Will you come with me
for a while, Spark?

329
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,833
Yes, sir! I don't mind, but--

330
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,541
[PARN]
Okay, this way.

331
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,666
Y-Yes.

332
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,833
[SPARK]
W-Why are we here?

333
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,583
Catch!

334
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,791
Huh? Uh...

335
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,000
But what do you want to--

336
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,375
I didn't come here
to talk to you.

337
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,666
I wanted to test
your skills, Spark.

338
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,000
[SPARK]
Huh?

339
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,333
[PARN] King Kashue says
you've gotten pretty good.

340
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,666
No, not really.

341
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,541
[PARN] Perhaps I'm not
good enough for you?

342
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,041
[SPARK]
N-No, sir! This is an honor!

343
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,416
Getting to match
swords with you,

344
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,208
the great free knight is, well--

345
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,750
It's a dream come true, sir!

346
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,458
Well then, shall we begin?

347
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,833
Yes!

348
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:11,958
[PARN yells]

349
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,750
[SPARK yelps]

350
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,333
When you cross swords,
nothing can distract you.

351
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,875
If this were a battle,
you'd already be dead!

352
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,625
Y-Yes, sir!

353
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,625
[yells]

354
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,375
A predictable charge.

355
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,458
[yells]

356
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,166
Watch your opponent's moves!

357
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,458
Then predict his next one!

358
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,583
You must think
before you attack.

359
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,041
You can never win
with just raw strength.

360
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,875
Right, sir!

361
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:45,791
[yells]

362
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:50,583
Keep on maneuvering until you
can really get a clean shot.

363
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,875
[PARN] Just what I'd
expect from someone

364
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,250
King Kashue has high hopes for.

365
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,916
The kid is good.

366
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,708
I'll never forget what
you taught me today.

367
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,500
Thank you so much, Sir Parn!

368
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,208
Good luck and stay safe.

369
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,875
Yes, sir! I will never abandon
my duties like I did last night.

370
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,291
The error was unforgivable.

371
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,666
Don't do that, either.

372
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,208
Don't do that? But why--

373
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,625
It's wrong to abandon yourself.

374
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,375
Don't become a man
who lives only

375
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,791
for the duty
that's given to him.

376
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,958
Huh?

377
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,125
You'll understand someday.

378
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,416
Ahh, Captain! Our last
member has arrived!

379
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,750
[SPARK]
Huh?

380
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,583
Forgive me for being late.

381
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,875
My name is Aldonova.

382
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,208
I am at your service,
Master Spark.

383
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,250
Just call me Spark, please.

384
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,208
Excuse me, the intruders
have been sighted

385
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,000
near Fortress 18 in the south!

386
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,166
Master Spark, you've got
to move out at once!

387
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,458
Understood!
We'll leave right now!

388
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,500
[KASHUE] I hope you're
right about this, Parn.

389
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,458
For better or for worse,
battle changes people.

390
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,708
I think this will
do him some good.

391
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,291
He has no idea that
the thing he seeks

392
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,083
will change the
future of Lodoss.

393
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,125
Perhaps it's better that way.

394
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,666
King Kashue, Kanon awaits us,

395
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,291
but we wish you
luck against the Marmo.

396
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,333
[KASHUE] Thanks.
And let us meet again soon.

397
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,416
And so, the fate of Lodoss
is placed once again

398
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,458
in the hands of one so young,
yet so full of promise.

399
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,000
[PARN, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

400
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,125
And now, what you've
been waiting for,

401
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,166
the second part!

402
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,916
Ha-ha!

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,958
I am Spark!
Knight of Flaim, Spark!

404
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,750
I am Spark!

405
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
But I'm still just
one in training.

406
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,125
What are you doing
over there, Spark?

407
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,833
I'm gonna leave you behind!

408
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,208
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

409
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,458
I know this is supposed to give
me experience as a knight,

410
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,291
but delivering cookies?!

411
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,916
What are you saying, Spark?

412
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,375
Guarding people is an
important job for a knight!

413
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,583
Yeah, I guess so.

414
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,208
[SPARK] First of all,
who would attack us

415
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,041
over some lousy cookies?

416
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,916
I don't think protecting baked
goods is valuable experience.

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,958
[gasps, yelps]

418
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,083
Spark!

419
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,625
I-I-I-I thought I was gonna die!

420
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,083
[DARK ELF laughs] Hey,
so you're the young champion

421
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,208
who's, uh, guarding the
young lady here, huh?

422
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,375
Who's there?!

423
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,166
I've been waiting
for you there, Neese!

424
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,958
You must be...

425
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,625
The Dark Elf with a sweet tooth!

426
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,416
Oh! Did you say Dark Elf?!

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,208
[DARK ELF] Now legend
has it there that, uh,

428
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,208
all the cookies baked in
the temple of Marfa there

429
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,583
have a taste that's
beyond compare!

430
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,000
Now let's have 'em!

431
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,083
Huh?!

432
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,666
[NEESE]
Oh, what a terrible thing!

433
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,291
Are you sure you're okay?

434
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,541
[SPARK]
Yeah, I think so.

435
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,125
[DARK ELF]
Hold it, hold it, hold it there!

436
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,333
You're supposed to listen
to me when I talk to you.

437
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,375
If you insult me again,
you'll taste my wrath!

438
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,250
[NEESE yelps]

439
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,291
[SPARK]
Hey!

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,666
[NEESE]
Huh?

441
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,125
[DARK ELF]
Ouch, huh.

442
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,208
Oh, thanks so much,
little dragon!

443
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,083
[dragon purrs]

444
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,791
[NEESE]
Okay, let's go!

445
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,666
[SPARK] I've got such a bad
feeling about what's ahead...

446
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,875
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

447
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,458
[SPARK] Pursuing our enemies,
we find ourselves

448
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,250
caught in a terrible trap
set by the Dark Elves!

449
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,208
An enormous monster
attacks the fortress!

450
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,916
And, as I face my
first real battle,

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,208
a lone girl appears
in a burst of light!

452
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,458
Next time,
on Record of Lodoss War:

453
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,458
Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:

454

Guided by the Gods."
