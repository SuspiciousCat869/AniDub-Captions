[NARRATOR]
Light and darkness...

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,666
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,333
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

However, the advance of Marmo
and their dark emperor, Beld,

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
is far greater than anyone
in Valis had anticipated.

Where the forces
of darkness pass,

43

only scorched earth is left
behind for the survivors.

his first war and all that.

Well, you can just
stop worrying

because I plan to protect
King Fahn no matter what!

you might have to kill?

Just once, would you

Well, now that
you're a knight of Valis,

you're probably gonna
wind up forgetting

174
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,083
about all the pain
we saw coming here.

If you can't forget it,
you're in trouble.

Because if you don't,

178
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:37,916
you'll never be able to
kill a man in battle. Eh?

Yes. The main force

I'll be returning.

would have been
revealed eventually.

[FAHN] Do you have time
to listen to an old story?

219
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
An old story?

220
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:14,208
Of when Valis wasn't nearly as
stable a nation as it is today.

221
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,541
I, along with the Holy Knights,
were attempting to form

222
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,416
a union of the various
regions of our land.

223
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,916
And the plan would unite
all of Lodoss. I see.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,791
I didn't want to
do it by force,

225
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:33,666
so I, along with my knights,
negotiated many treaties.

226
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:50,250
[TRIBE MAN A] So, the King of
Valis dares to break our treaty!

227
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
[FAHN] At that time, one tribe
was being harassed by

228
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,791
Shooting Star, the demon dragon
of Fire Dragon Mountain.

[screaming]

230
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,916
[FAHN] Citing our defense
treaty, the tribe leaders

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,166
demanded my newborn daughter,
Fianna, as a sacrifice

232
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,166
to quell the
demon dragon's evil fire.

233
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,875
[FAHN]
But, I... I...!

234
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,666
Taking Fianna back would
have broken the treaty.

235
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,958
But then...

236
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,416
You?

237
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,583

the princess, Your Majesty.

is worth a human life.

241
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,916
[TESSIUS]
This is my plan alone.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,625
It will appear
as if you just have

243
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,541
a bad subordinate
in your ranks.

244
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,125
Isn't that acceptable?

[FAHN]
Fianna was returned safely.

246

When war finally broke out
with that tribe,

247
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:14,541
Tessius silently, dutifully
left for the front.

I never saw him again.
