1
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,000
[GUARD A] Halt! The king has
declared a state of war!

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,916
No one is allowed into Valis
under any circumstances.

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,750
Ya think you can stop us?!

4
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,750
[gasping]

5
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,333
Calm down, Garrack.

6
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,583
We have been sent here by
order of the king of Flaim.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,833
I have a message for King Etoh.

8
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:23,083
You've come from Flaim?
Then, please, forgive us.

9
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,166
I know your security
is important,

10
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,583
but are things really
that bad here?

11
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,583
Yes, they are, I'm afraid.

12
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,750
The Marmo just won't let up.

13
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,208
Would your message be about
Flaim sending reinforcements?!

14
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,750
[gasping]

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,583
Will King Kashue himself be
leading the troops from Flaim?

16
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,333
[GUARD C] When are they
going to get here?!

17
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,666
[SPARK] I never knew
things were this bad...

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,125
Valis really needs help.

19
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,875
It's very quiet, Priest Greevus.

20
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,583
Yes, it is. The people
are probably afraid

21
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,833
to come out of their homes.

22
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,291
[SPARK]
I think you're right.

23
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,000
Valis's army must be having
a really tough time

24
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,041
trying to fight off the Marmo.

25
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,833
Just like them. And now
they're all counting

26
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,500
on the army of Flaim
to come and save them.

27
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,458
[RYNA] But King Etoh
has a good reputation.

28
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
Could it be that
the people of Valis

29
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,875
have lost faith
in him as a leader?

30
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,708
I don't think that's it.

31
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,000
King Etoh has close ties
to the free knight Parn,

32
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,916
and he's also the High Priest
at the temple of Falis.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,041
However, in times of war,
people seek out heroes.

34
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,916
No matter how skilled a
priest he is and no matter

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,500
how well he governs,
Etoh is not a warrior.

36
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,625
Not a warrior...

37
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,375
[LEAF]
Is this the royal palace?

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,708
[NEESE]
It's the holy palace.

39
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,791
We've come from the kingdom of
Flaim with an important dispatch

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:16,125
from King Kashue. I request
an audience with King Etoh.

41
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,791
We're glad you're here.

42
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:22,375
Some messengers from Flaim have
arrived! Lower the drawbridge!

43
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,750
[GARRACK grunting]

44
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,250
[LEAF] Garrack, you're so
jumpy. Is anything wrong?

45
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,041
Uh, no. I'm just a little
tense for some reason.

46
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
Perhaps you've got
a guilty conscious.

47
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,208
What? I haven't done
anything wrong, Leaf!

48
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,250
Then why are you so angry?

49
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,875
I'm not angry, so just shut up!

50
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,583
That's enough! Now quiet down!

51
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,708
[BOTH]
Huh?!

52
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,166
[GARRACK chuckles]

53
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,916
[SPARK growls]

54
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,000
[MESSENGER] I've brought the
messengers, Your Highness.

55
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,791
--[RYNA] Hmm?
--[NEESE giggles]

56
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:18,083
[door creaks]

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,583
Greetings, King Etoh.
From King Kashue of Flaim.

58
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,041
I welcome you to
the kingdom of Valis,

59
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,750
young messengers of Flaim.

60
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,416
Do you have something
you wish to give to me?

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,041
Yes!

62
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,375
The message is from King Kashue,
and I have read it.

63
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,958
Be sure to store this carefully.

64
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,458
Master Spark, are you aware
of what this message says?

65
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,541
Uh, no, sir. I'm not.
Is anything wrong?

66
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,541
Not as far as I can tell.
But King Kashue's message to me

67
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,958
also contained a
message for you.

68
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,791
But what did the message
say, Your Highness?

69
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,125
First, you must tell
me something, Spark.

70
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,791
Were you successful
in recovering

71
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,791
the stolen crystal ball?

72
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,791
Um... No, sir, we were not.

73
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,291
We were able to kill the
thieves, but they had already

74
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,083
handed off the treasure
to someone else.

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,750
How unfortunate.

76
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,500
[SPARK] Your Highness, I was
hoping that you would allow us

77
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,083
to continue our search
here in Valis.

78
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,666
No, I will not.

79
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,291
But... But why, sir?

80
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,541
The message says that if
you have not recovered

81
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,083
the Soul Crystal Ball by the
time you reach me, then you

82
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,208
and your entire party are to
return immediately to Flaim.

83
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,458
[gasping]

84
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,875
But, sir! Are you sure
that's what it said?!

85
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,250
[ALL gasping]

86
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,500
[gasps]

87
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,291
Forgive me!
That was very rude, sir.

88
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,375
[SPARK] How could I say that?!
King Etoh is a priest;

89
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,583
he wouldn't lie to me.
That was bad form.

90
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:26,625
Well? That is definitely what
King Kashue wrote, Master Spark.

91
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,000
[SPARK] And there goes
any chance I might've had

92
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,166
of completing my mission.

93
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,375
[SPARK groans]

94
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:40,083
[SPARK] Didn't King Kashue have
any hope for me at all...?

95
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,333
I bet he never expected me
to recover the crystal.

96
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,666
That's why he sent that message.

97
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
[RYNA]
King Kashue probably thought

98
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,375
it would be too
dangerous for you

99
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,750
to go searching through
Valis during war time.

100
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,625
She's right, Spark. The king
is concerned for your safety.

101
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,041
[SPARK] But--! If we don't
recover the Soul Crystal Ball,

102
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,833
well... then...
Then Neese will be--!

103
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,000
Spark, it's all right.
I'll be quite safe,

104
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,041
as long as the Staff
of Life remains

105
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,541
under close guard here in Valis.

106
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,916
Do you really believe it's safe?

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,750
Yes, I do.

108
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,208
Then so do I.

109
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,666
It's safe, but I can't stop
thinking about that ball.

110
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,250
I know... The bag man
has to come through Roid

111
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,750
to get the crystal to Kanon.

112
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,375
So, Captain, do we obey the
king's order and go home?

113
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,916
[SPARK]
Well, uh...

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,583
[RYNA] Or do we disobey and
continue on with our mission?

115
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,083
Hey, hey!

116
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,833
Excuse me, but I think I've
got an idea that might help.

117
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,916
We are all invited to
the banquet tonight

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,833
which gives us plenty
of time before sunset.

119
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,083
I suggest that we ask

120
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,208
to do a little sightseeing
by the waterfront.

121
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,041
That's nice. Then what?

122
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:52,250
Uh... Then we can investigate.
If we find a clue,

123
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,208
then we can think about
what we should do next.

124
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,625
Hey! You sorcerers are smart!

125
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,000
[ALDO] What do you think,
Priest Greevus?

126
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,833
While I don't think
it right to deceive,

127
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:10,041
I think even Myrii would forgive
the sin... in this case.

128
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,125
Well? That settles it!

129
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,791
Are you going to come
with us, Neese?

130
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,000
[NEESE] I'm sorry, but I must
spend some time with King Etoh.

131
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,791
I'll meet up with you later.

132
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,333
You may not know this,
but King Etoh

133
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,250
is an old friend
of Neese's family.

134
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,625
I see...

135
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,541
So... what now?

136
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,708
I think it's up to our captain.

137
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,208
Well then, Captain.

138
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,250
Come on! Captain!

139
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,625
[SPARK]
Uh...

140
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,750
[SPARK]
Uh...

141
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
Very well, then.

142
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,083
We've all worked too hard.
Let's do all that we can.

143
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,291
Okay, then! Let's go, everyone!

144
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,208
I'm not taking orders from you.

145
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,666
[LEAF]
Oh, shut up!

146
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,500
[SPARK] So, how can we
tell which of the ships

147
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,083
are suspicious and which aren't?

148
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,375
We're just going to
have to check each one.

149
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,625
But we can't be too
obvious about it,

150
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,250
or King Etoh will
find us out for sure.

151
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,625
[LEAF]
Come on, Captain.

152
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,500
Haven't you decided
what we're gonna do yet?

153
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,708
[sighs] I wish that Neese
was here to help us out.

154
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,000
[RYNA]
Hey, come on, now.

155
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,041
What are you all standing
around here for?

156
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,625
[SPARK]
It's Ryna.

157
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,833
At a time like this, we should
be mixing in with the crowds.

158
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,708
But what will we do then?

159
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,083
We spread a rumor that we're
looking for a ship to Kanon.

160
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,666
Then we can stand aside and let
our rumor find the ship for us.

Well, where do we go, Ryna?

163
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,666

are lots of sailors around?

here to eat, am I right?

Absolutely! Why don't you start

If there is one,
I've got to get on it.

Don't you know that it's
against the law for anyone

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,708
to travel to Kanon while
we're at war with them?

If the guards ever find out,
they'll scoop you up.

192
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,333
[RYNA] I told you, I have
a reason. My friends and I

193
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,875
wanna become mercenaries
for the Marmo.

194
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,916
[BARKEEP]
Mercenaries for the Marmo?!

I-I won't know for sure without
asking the soldiers,

196
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,125
but... but...

197
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,333
But I can count on you, right?

198
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,500
Yeah...

199
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,666
Get me a name, and I'll
take care of you.

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,625
If you need me, I'll be
hanging around port.

[BARKEEP]
Oh...

203
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,666
Okay. Now, let's move
on to the next one.

204
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,458
Uh... But shouldn't we
just wait here, Ryna?

205
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,083
The more we can spread
the word, Spark,

206
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:49,083
the better our chance of
finding someone. Am I right?

207
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,416
Yes, Ryna.
You're something else.

208
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,708
Really? You just
noticed that, huh?

209
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,791
[ETOH] You want to talk
about the Staff of Life,

210
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
don't you, Neese?

211
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,041
I do, Your Highness.

212
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,250
Nobody knows this, Neese,
but thieves broke into

213
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,833
the Temple of Falis as well.

214
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,083
[gasps]

215
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,666
Of course, the temple
soldiers drove them away

216
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,208
and the Staff of Life
is perfectly safe.

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,250
The god of Light shines his
protection on this place.

218
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,125
You are fortunate.

219
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,625
I am truly thankful
for His providence.

220
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,708
And what is going
to be the next step

221
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,625
on the journey of the Doorway?

222
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,166
Now that I know the
Staff of Life is safe,

223
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,666
I can travel on
with peace of mind.

224
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,041
[ETOH]
To Marmo?

225
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
[NEESE]
Mm. If I do nothing,

226
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,708
then the dark wizard
will surely snatch me up.

227
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,125
So I've decided to go there
and face things by myself.

228
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,625
And I want to recover the
Soul Crystal Ball as well.

229
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,500
As long as it remains
in Marmo hands,

230
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,583
Spark will never be
able to live it down.

231
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,708
I know how it feels
to want to help others,

232
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,000
but it's also important
for you to remember that

233
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,250
you're just one girl, Neese.

234
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,458
[NEESE]
Hmm?

235
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,833
It's impossible for
you to be all things.

236
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:07,041
It's okay for you to rely
on other people for help.

237
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,958
You may be right, but...

238
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,791
But now is the time
that I must be strong.

239
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
If I do not resist by myself,

240
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,708
then evil will take
over my heart!

241
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,125
I see you won't
change your mind.

[NEESE sighs]

243
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,208
May the god of Light shine his
glorious continence upon you.

00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,250
I am grateful, King Etoh.

00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,625
[SPARK panting]

315
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,291
[SPARK] I hope they all
make it back okay.

316
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,875
In here.

317
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,416
[GUARD E]
Stop him!

318
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,625
[SAILORS yelling]

319
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,583
[SPARK]
Damn!

320
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:47,333
[yelling continues]

321
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,208
[sighs]

322
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,916
That was close. Thanks a lot.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,208
It's all right. You've got guts

324
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,833
taking on a bunch
of Valis sailors.

325
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,875
I didn't want to fight them.

326
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,833
[chuckles]

327
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,125
So what is your
next move gonna be?

328
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,958
You can stay if you wanna hide.

329
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,916
No! I've got to find my
friends. I'm going back.

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,250
You care about them.
That's good.

331
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,875
My name is Jay.

332
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,875
And if you feel like it, come by
the bridge with your friends

333
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,375
after the moon rises this night.

334
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,791
I'll take you to Kanon.

335
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,291
[gasps]

336
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,750
Then you can become
mercenaries for the Marmo.

337
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,375
[SPARK whimpers]

338
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:41,666
[snickers, laughs]

339
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,875
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

340
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,041
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

341
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,458
the second part!

342
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,750
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

343
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:08,333
[LITTLE DRAGON squeaking]

344
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,041
[SPARK]
Oh, I'm so beat...

345
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,833
I'm really glad that we're
finally out of that dungeon,

346
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,500
but why did we wander in
there in the first place?

347
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,166
It was the will of
the gods, you dope.

348
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,875
I guess you're right.
Hey, Neese...

349
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,958
You can use your magic to give
me my strength back, can't you?

350
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:26,833
Yeah...

351
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
I don't mean to impose, but...

352
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,458
Yeah? What the hey,
I'll give it a try.

353
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,125
That's great!
Lay it all me, mama!

354
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,666
"This is Neese calling Marfa,
mother of the Earth!"

355
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,333
Oh, I forgot.
How did it go again?

356
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,166
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

357
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,041
"Make it snappy,
don't take long.

358
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,375
Time to make this
weak guy strong!"

359
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,625
Whoa, mama!

360
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,166
[SPARK yells]

361
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,250
Oh, dear...
I think I screwed up.

362
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,875
[VOICE] Oh, ho, ho. What unusual
visitors you are there, huh?

363
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,416
It's a kindly priest.

364
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,458
I welcome you, and I want
to give you my, uh,

365
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,625
what-do-you-call-it,
kind thought of the day.

366
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,500
[NEESE]
Gee, thanks a lot!

367
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,625
And now, I'm going to tell
you my, uh, kind thought.

368
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:18,708
But before I do, I noticed you
have some yummy cookies there.

369
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,666
Do you think that I
could have one? Huh?

370
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,958
Back the hell off!

371
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,250
These cookies are reserved
for the mama dragon!

372
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,833
[LITTLE DRAGON squawking]

373
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,916
[PRIEST]
Whoa there! Ah!

374
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,250
[SPARK]
The Dark Elf!

375
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,583
Stifle yourself, cookie head!

376
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,041
He... vanished!

377
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,333
[DARK ELF] So, who's
the smart guy now, huh?

378
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,541
[DARK ELF]
Ouch.

379
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,791
This ain't over there, little
girl! Whoopty-doo, whoopty-doo!

380
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,125
This guy is such a lame villain.

381
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,625
You're tellin' me?

382
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,000
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seeing you!

383
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,333
[NEESE] We meet a mysterious
man in the port of Roid.

384
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:14,125
From what he tells us, we
believe that the holy kingdom

385
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,000
is about to be attacked.

386
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,833
Are they aiming for the Staff
of Life at the temple of Falis?

387
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,208
What will Spark decide to do?

388
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,583
Next time, on
<i>Record of Lodoss War</i> :

389

<i>Heroic Knight</i> :
