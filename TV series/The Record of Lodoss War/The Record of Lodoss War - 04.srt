1
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,541
[MAN A]
They're off to battle!

2
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,125
[MAN B]
The fire dragon will never

3
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,375
withstand an army like this!

4
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,958
[MAN C]
Long live King Kashue!

5
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,166
[KASHUE] What?! Priest Hobb
has joined Ashram?!

6
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,250
[NARRATOR] At the temple
of Myrii, the God of War,

7
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,250
Kashue and Parn discover
that the once loyal Priest Hobb

8
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,000
has gone off with Ashram.

9
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,958
I should have known
better than to trust Hobb.

10
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,458
He's only loyal to his god.

11
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,416
King Kashue...

12
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,833
[KASHUE]
Don't let it bother you, Parn.

13
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,625
All this means is that the
number of our enemies

14
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,500
has grown by one.

15
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,625
Although, to be honest,

16
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,500
I'd rather not make
an enemy of Hobb.

17
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
Whatever the case,

18
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,416
defeating Shooting Star
is our first priority.

19
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,625
Right.

20
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,041
Parn? Uh?

21
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,375
[BOTH]
Shiris?!

22
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,791
It's really too bad, Parn.
Now we have to split up.

23
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,125
I guess so.

24
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,125
Isn't it time for you to go?

25
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,541
You don't wanna keep
the others waiting now.

26
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,875
Calm down, you crabby elf!

27
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,000
Bye-bye, Parn.

28
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,541
Why that...

29
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,333
It looks like there's
something bothering you.

30
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,541
Tell me, is there anything
wrong, Deedlit? Huh?

31
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,500
Uh... Oh, no.
It's just that we elves

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,750
don't take too well to
the desert, that's all.

33
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,208
I see.

34
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,375
Well then, I'm really sorry
for all those other times

35
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,041
that you and I had to go out
into the desert, Deed.

36
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,458
Well, that's all right.

37
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,708
Oh, well. There they go.

38
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,000
While Parn and the others
are off to slay Shooting Star,

39
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,708
we must embark
on our own mission.

40
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,041
Yes, Slayn. Let's begin.

41
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,000
Give us the word, Orson.

42
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,916
Okay, Leader, what's going
to be our first move?

43
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:59,416
Prepare to leave.
Our first stop is Raiden.

44
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,083
[SAILORS screaming]

45
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,291
[SAILOR A]
The pirates are attacking!

46
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,833
[SAILOR B]
Help us! Help us!

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,958
[PIRATE A]
What a haul! What a haul!

48
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,208
[PIRATE B laughs]
They were such easy marks,

49
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,250
it was almost boring!

50
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,666
Come on now!
Get this booty unloaded!

51
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,500
[BOTH snickering]

52
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,458
Looks like teaming
up with the Marmo

53
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,916
is gonna have its benefits.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,125
And I actually thought this job

55
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,666
wasn't going to be
very profitable for us.

56
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,375
All we do now is wait
for Sir Ashram.

57
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,666
This job is turning out
to be pretty sweet.

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
[PIRATES laugh]

59
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,291
Boss! It's Sir Ashram...

60
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,791
Ashram's arrived!
And he's headed this way!

61
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,791
Um, Sir Ashram is here?!

62
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,583
[laughs nervously]

63
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,000
We've been expecting you,
Sir Ashram. Welcome! Welcome!

64
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,833
Expecting me? Really?

65
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,791
Our agreement never included
anything about playing pirates.

66
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,125
B-But when we're not fighting,

67
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,125
we have to steal
t-to support the ship!

68
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,458
But, u-uh, of course,

69
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,000
we'll split half our haul
with you, Sir Ashram.

70
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,208
Just get your ship
ready to sail.

71
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,250
Those are your only
orders now, Alhaib.

72
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,416
Y-You mean...?

73
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,416
We leave at once for
Blue Dragon Island.

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,875
The sea dragon Abram
awaits us. Now hurry!

75
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,875
Yes, sir! Right away!

76
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,250
[GROUP chuckles]

77
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,666
Our mission has but one aim:
The Scepter of Domination.

78
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,666
And if Abram does
not possess it,

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,125
then we will pull out at once.

80
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,458
And if he does have it?

81
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
[ASHRAM]
Then... we must fight him.

82
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,416
As long as Abram
is under the spell

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,541
of the ancient kingdom
of Sorcery,

84
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,958
his only purpose is
to guard that treasure.

85
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,125
We must be swift and decisive.

86
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,458
Win the first time,
and win for all time.

87
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,541
That is the proper way.

88
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,916
[HOBB]
Hm?

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,791
It is possible to reason
with the dragon.

90
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:29,333
However, we must first determine
if he actually has the treasure.

91
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,583
[ASHRAM]
It looks as though I'll have to

92
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,333
leave that to you, Groder.

93
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,041
I shall not fail, Sir Ashram.

94
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,125
Where are you going?

95
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,750
My interests go beyond sorcery.

96
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,750
The unusual land formations in
the area are most intriguing,

97
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,041
and I was hoping to get
a better look at them.

98
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,125
Well then, just make sure
you don't fall off a cliff.

99
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,083
And be sure to give my
regards to Master Wagnard.

100
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,208
[GRODER] Ashram is
preparing to battle Abram

101
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,166
on Blue Dragon Island.

102
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,541
He will surely deliver to you
that which you desire, Master.

103
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,000
However, do not take
Ashram too lightly.

104
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,416
I think he's realized what
your plans are, my lord.

105
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
[WAGNARD]
If he hadn't already done so,

106
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,416
he'd be of no use to me.

107
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,041
Do not forget, Groder,

108
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,583
we must retrieve the
Soul Crystal Ball as well.

109
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,000
I pray your next report
will be a favorable one.

110
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,125
[GRODER]
By your command.

111
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,166
[sighs]

112
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,166
The resurrection of
Kardis approaches.

113
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,666
And on that day, I shall possess
the knowledge of the ages

114
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,916
and become the supreme being!

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,958
[laughing]

116
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:09,125
[HOBB] The sorcerer Groder
cannot be trusted.

117
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,791
He's hiding a secret agenda
deep down in his heart.

118
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,750
[ASHRAM]
I know that.

119
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
It's not just him.

120
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,833
I'm suspicious of Gaberra
and Astar as well.

121
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,458
Aside from the mercenaries
Gilram and Smeddy,

122
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,708
the others were sent
by the likes of me,

123
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,208
rulers of Marmo, and
I don't trust them at all.

124
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,791
In that case, you should
be very careful.

125
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:35,375
A man who fears petty betrayal
isn't worthy of Marmo's crown.

126
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,000
That is part of what
it means to be king.

127
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,625
Well that may be true,

128
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,625
it is still the nature of a hero
to ignore trivial matters.

129
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,375
You're quite right.

130
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:50,208
And a true hero always gets
all that he sets out to gain.

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,500
[NARRATOR] Orson and
the others have arrived

132
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,625
at the free city of Raiden,

133
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,791
but with the panic caused
by the recent pirate raids,

134
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,083
securing a ship to
Blue Dragon Island

135
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,916
proves to be an
insurmountable challenge.

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,958
[flute playing]

137
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,791
Oh, no luck...

138
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,000
[SHIRIS growls]

139
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,083
Huh?

140
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:30,791
[SHIRIS]
Why are these sailors so afraid

141
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,958
of a few lousy pirates?!

142
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,833
Ugh!

143
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,625
[SLAYN]
You can't really blame them.

144
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,458
Not everyone can be as
valiant as you are, Shiris.

145
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,625
Well then, if no one
else will do it,

146
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,625
we'll have to take care
of them ourselves.

147
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,916
Huh?

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,666
Take care of them?

149
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,875
[SLAYN]
How can you say that, Shiris?

150
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,166
Have you forgotten our mission?

151
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,208
Yeah! That's the reason I hate
war-happy mercenaries like you!

152
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,625
What did you say?!

153
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,541
[MAAR]
I know where the pirates are.

154
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,958
[chuckles]

155
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
[SHIRIS]
Who are you?

156
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,083
You're a meadow sprite.
A grass runner, right?

157
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,375
They call me Maar the Bard.

158
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,166
But I'm much more
than just a poet.

159
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,916
I know a lot!

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,416
Like how to find pirates.

161
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,458
Tell us how!

162
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,791
Of course!

163
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,875
But you must promise to
take me with you! Or-- Ah!

164
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,291
Come on now!

165
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,000
You don't really expect us
to believe that, do you?!

166
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,916
Let me go! Put me down!

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,666
Just put him down.

168
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,250
[SHIRIS sighs]

169
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,291
If Parn was here, he'd be all
for taking out those pirates.

170
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,958
Yes, he would.

171
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,250
So we'll take care of
those pirates ourselves.

172
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:59,166
But are you sure, Orson?
Think this through.

173
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,708
What's to think?

174
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,833
With the pirates out there,

175
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,125
there's no way
for us to continue.

176
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,916
So our only choice now
is to get rid of them.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,708
Well, I guess
you're right, but--

178
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,041
If Maar's information
is correct,

179
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,541
the pirates will never be
suspecting an attack

180
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,083
by our little group.

181
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,000
He knows what he's
talking about.

182
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,458
[ORSON]
And one more thing.

183
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,625
[BOTH]
Hm?

184
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,041
What is it?

185
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,250
If we capture the pirates' ship,

186
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,166
we won't have to outfit
one for ourselves.

187
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,291
[SHIRIS]
That's right!

188
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,916
Well, then!
I guess it's settled.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,541
Anyone have a problem
with our leader's plan?

190
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,958
I knew you had what it takes
to be a leader, Orson.

191
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,416
You really are like Parn.

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Well, before a battle,
you've got to have a party.

193
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,208
Tonight, we drink
and make merry!

194
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:50,041
Ah! In that case,
you'll probably need this!

195
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,916
Hey, you! How did
you get my money?!

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,458
Why, you little thief!

197
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,666
Uh-oh!

198
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,375
Come back here, you!

199
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,666
[SHIRIS]
Orson?

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,500
I hope I didn't make
you nervous before.

201
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,958
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,375
When I mentioned Parn
would fight the pirates,

203
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,333
did you only agree
with what I said

204
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,083
because you really just
wanted to show him up?

205
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,458
It's just as I
explained it, Shiris.

206
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,625
That's it?

207
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,541
That's it.

208
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,166
You could be a little
jealous, you know!

209
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,208
A girl really likes
to be fought over.

210
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,208
[DEEDLIT] I wonder how Slayn
and the others are doing now.

211
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
Do you think Orson
is doing a good job?

212
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,458
[PARN]
They're fine.

213
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,416
I'm sure Slayn chose the
right leader for them.

214
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,666
And if we can free Orson

215
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,833
from the control
of the spirit of anger,

216
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,125
I think Leylia will finally
be rid of her guilt

217
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,791
over what happened while she
was under Karla's control.

218
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,208
I know that is Slayn's hope.

219
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,541
That's one of Slayn's
best qualities.

220
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,583
He goes so far out of his
way just to help others.

221
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,875
Humans... You really
are so strange.

222
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,583
[DEEDLIT]
More like incomprehensible,

223
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,541
if you ask an elf.

224
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,916
Oh, we may be strange,
but we're easy to understand.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,625
Look at Slayn,
and you'll see a man

226
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,458
who likes the simple things--

227
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,333
to grow enough food
for his family,

228
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,666
and to teach his children
what they need to know.

229
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,666
Simple and easy.

230
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,041
It's sad.

231
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,000
These troubled times won't
allow anything to be simple.

232
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,250
Not yet.

233
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,041
[KASHUE]
Tell me, Parn.

234
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,708
How would you like to be a king?

235
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,416
That's why I should try to find
the things I know I can change

236
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,291
and focus on them.

237
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,958
Isn't that right, Deed?

238
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,250
[DEEDLIT]
Mm.

239
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
[PARN gasps]

240
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,208
What the...?

241
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
Oh, Parn. Look there.

242
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,291
What is that?! Uh!

243
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:02,125
[SOLDIERS gasping]

244
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,000
It's the wrath of Shooting
Star. They all burned alive.

245
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,625
[KASHUE]
They will not have died in vain.

246
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,833
We'll launch our
attack here! Prepare!

247
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,958
You really think he'll return?

248
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,958
He will, without a doubt.

249
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,875
If there's one thing
he can't resist,

250
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,458
it's human meat in
his feeding grounds.

251
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:42,541
[snoring]

252

[SHIRIS]
Mm... Orson...

253
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,500
[SHIRIS] C'mon...
You call yourself a man?

254
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,208
[ORSON]
You'll catch a cold.

255
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,583
[SHIRIS]
Mmm... Warm...

256
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,041
[SHIRIS] You should be a
little jealous, you know!

257
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,500
[DEEDLIT]
But don't worry, though.

258
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,083
I'm sure this journey will
help you to feel once again.

259
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,625
[SLAYN] I believe in the
strength of your will, Orson.

260
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,500
Can I accept it?
The face of rage...?

261

[ORSON]
My sister...

262
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,000
It started here.

263
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,916
All of my memories after
this are controlled by rage.

264

[ORSON]
That was too close...

282
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,833
And too dangerous to try again.

283
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,208
But I'm sure I heard it.

284
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,416
It was the voice
of the spirit of anger.

285

Let's go.

286

Here he comes!

What do you think of
that one, Orson? Huh?

321
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,875
[yelps]

322
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,458
Isn't there anyone who
can make you laugh?!

323
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,416
[KASHUE]
You're all amateurs!

324
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,416
Step aside! Let me have a crack!

325
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,875
The King?

326
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:30,583
Orson, Mama's gonna go out!
I'm gonna find you a dad!

327
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,791
[ALL groan]

328
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:38,000
[grunting]

329
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,958
Ah! Somebody gimme a
chance to try again!

330
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:46,041
Mama's going out...
to try to find a dad...

331
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,125
Mmm.

332
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,208
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

333
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,625
[PARN] At last, the time to
battle Shooting Star has come!

334
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,000
Flying through the air
with its huge wings!

335
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,625
Incinerating the ground
with deadly fire breath!

336
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,208
The soldiers of Flaim
fall in huge numbers!

337
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,166
Meanwhile, Orson must
face the ghostly light

338
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,416
of the Demon Sword!

339
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,875
