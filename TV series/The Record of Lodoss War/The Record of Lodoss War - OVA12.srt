The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

Marfa, goddess of all creation,

and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

At the end of their
fierce battle,

the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

stop him, Parn! You alone!

162
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,875
Now, go! Hurry now!

163
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,125
--I can't just--
--Parn! Let's go!

164
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,500
But they'll--!

165
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,583
--Are you ready?
--Yes.

166
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:37,125
"Omnipotent power,
creator of all things..."

167
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,708
"...throw off these
false garments

168
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,500
and reveal they true form.

169
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,708
Become a barrier
to protect us."

170
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,125
[NARSE roars]

171
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,541
[JESTER]
Keep away from the front!

172
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,166
You'll be caught in the flames!

173
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,166
[MERCENARY screams]

174
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,958
What's that thing
want with us?!

175
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,041
I'd say he doesn't want us
getting too close to him.

176
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,333
He's in our way.

177
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:10,291
[SHIRIS] Orson,
it's impossible! Orson!

178
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,791
--What is that?
--[KASHUE] Huh?

179
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,750
[JESTER]
Ah! Mycen!

180
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,833
[MYCEN growls]

181
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,875
[JESTER]
Right, we understand!

182
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,125
Kashue! The golden dragon
Mycen will deal with Narse!

183
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,458
Don't worry!

184
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,875

[roars]

187

[WORT] Karla! Is Kardis'
resurrection necessay

188
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,000
to balance the scales
of history?!

189
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:21,625
[KARLA] For 500 years, my soul
has resided in this circlet

190
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,958
for the singular purpose
that I watch over Lodoss,

191
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,541
nothing more.

192
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,458
History must be
written by humans.

193
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,291
[WORT] And you aren't
human, is that it?

194
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,750
You think you're
the eyes of the gods

195
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,000
looking down
from the heavens?

196
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,250
Tell me if those eyes
will be watching silently

197
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,958
as Kardis is reborn.

198
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,916
[KARLA]
Did I not tell you?

199
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,083
I exist for only
one purpose:

200
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,916
to save Lodoss
from destruction.

201
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,916
[mumbles]

202
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,041
You give your life to empower
a magnificent goddess.

203
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,041
[chuckles]

204

[MAN groans]

205
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,541
But I thought you...

206
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,791
[ASHRAM] When did I ever allow
you to do whatever you wanted?

207
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,916
[WAGNARD] Who carried you
back from the netherworld?

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,833
I see, you've thrown your
lot in with that witch!

209
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,250
The powers of the gods are
beyond any man's abilities.

210
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,958
Even yours, Wagnard.
You should know your limits.

211
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,958
[chuckles]
Unfortunately, my limits

212
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,375
aren't quite the question here.

213
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
But Kardis' are!

214
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:43,875

[ETOH yells]

Etoh!

223
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,083
It's all right!
I'll handle this thing!

224
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,083
--You keep going!
--No way!

225
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:35,250
By the awesome powers of Falis!

226
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,250
My prayers will
do more than swords!

227
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,958
--Don't worry, just go!
--Etoh!

228
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:52,666
Go now! Hurry up, Parn!
Think about Deedlit!

229
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,750
You know what we came here for!

230
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:00,375
If you save Deed, you save
all of Lodoss as well!

231
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:05,083
I'm glad we made it this far
together, you and me.

232
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,291
Thanks, Etoh...

233
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,291
By the glory of Falis!

234
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,291
[WAGNARD] You wish to
continue living in shame?

235
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,166
[ASHRAM] Neither Marmo nor
Lodoss is your plaything.

236
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,750
[WAGNARD laughs]

237
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,916
Mere trifles, at best.

238
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,333
When the powers
of the gods are mine,

239
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,250
nothing else will matter.

240
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,958
What I desire is the power!

241
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:58,291
And when I have it,
I shall be invincible.

You're pathetic.
Now, know my wrath.

Parn... Forgive me...

00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,666
I can't...
