You insignificant flea!

How dare you corrupt
the Doorway's heart?!

3
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,125
The sacrifice to Kardis
must remain pure!

4
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,291
I'll not let you interfere.

5
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,500
It's Wagnard!

[SPARK gasps]

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,791
The time has come
for me to take you.

8
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,958
And now, we shall journey
to the dark island.

00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,250
It is your destiny.
You cannot fight it.

And now, Doorway,

24
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,291
we shall return to the
dark island of Marmo.

Come on, Leaf. We're fighting
against a dark wizard.

He's got Neese exactly
where he wants her,

on the dark island of Marmo.

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,625
Dammit! We should team up with
the free army and go after her.

35
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,916
I don't see the point.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,125
Now Wagnard's finally got
the sacrifice he needs

37
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,333
to revive Kardis...
And that means...

[GARRACK groans]

00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
[SPARK] I couldn't protect
the Soul Crystal Ball

00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:48,125
or the Staff of Life.
And now, I've lost Neese.

Oh, Neese.

[RYNA]
Spark!

48
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,666
Now wait a minute, Spark.
What do you think you're doing?

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,500
What does it look like I'm
doing?! I'm going after Neese!

50
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,625
[RYNA] What do you mean
you're going after her?

51
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,333
Now think, Spark.

52
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,416
[PARN] If you just go
to Marmo without a plan,

53
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,833
you will die needlessly.

[gasps]

55
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,375
You cannot undo
what's been done.

56
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,000
Now just calm down
and think this over.

57
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,166
But... I have thought
this through!

58
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,875
Neese has been kidnapped
and it's my fault!

59
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,166
Are you saying there's
something else I can do?!

60
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,208
Stop it, Spark!

61
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,333
[gasps]

62
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,958
[PARN]
I understand how you feel,

63
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,583
but you can't think clearly
when you're this angry.

64
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,583
Now listen: We're going ahead
with my plans as I've made them.

65
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:54,916
We will join up with Prince
Ryona and retake Roodo.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,583
If we're successful, then
we can cross into Marmo

67
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,250
without so much as a scratch.

68
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,958
But how long?
How long will it be before

69
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,375
we can cross over into Marmo?

70
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,125
I don't know.
But, for right now,

71
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,000
this is our only
sure path toward

72
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,666
finally striking back at Marmo.

73
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,208

Tomorrow morning,
we leave for Roodo.

[SPARK whimpers]

77
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,333
[SPARK] Oh, why can't I
just abandon everything

78
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,041
and go after her?!

79
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,125
For all we know, right now,
Neese could be...!

80
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,708
Please calm down.

81
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,166
[SPARK]
I've got to decide right now...

82
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,000
I've got to determine the
best way to save Neese.

[NEESE grunts, gasps]

84
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,041

I know you'll come...

Please return me to my home."

goddess is interfering.

[NEESE gasps]

96
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,291
[WAGNARD] So, Doorway,
you're finally awake.

97
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,000
I welcome you to the
dark island of Marmo.

98
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,666
It's Wagnard!

99
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,250
What's wrong? Won't your
goddess answer your prayers?

100
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,791
[WAGNARD laughs]

101
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,583
Then again, you are in a
shrine dedicated to Kardis,

102
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,791
the almighty Goddess
of Destruction.

103
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,333
Your powers are useless here,
and the knight who defends you

104
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,500
is far, far away.

105
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,125
But Wagnard, why would
you even attempt

106
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:35,166
to resurrect someone as evil
as the Goddess of Destruction?

107
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,875
[WAGNARD]
Why would I? Hmph!

108
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,875
Is it not natural for one
who is great and powerful

109
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,541
to seek even greater power?

110
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,791
[gasps]

111
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,708
It was for that reason
alone that I was able

112
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,250
to acquire the forbidden spells.

113
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,166
Those fools at the Academy of
Sages cast me out of their

114
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,375
mystic brotherhood when they
discovered what I had done,

115
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,833
forcing me to endure the torment
of the spells I'd stolen.

116
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:07,125
But alas, I shall not
have suffered in vain.

117
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,458
You're a sick man.

118
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,416
What do you want from this?

119
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,166
[WAGNARD]
Ah...

120
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,125
When Kardis is reborn, all will
be consumed by darkness.

121
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,208
The people, the land,

122
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:25,875
every living creature
will be destroyed.

123
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,375
But for me, the annihilation
of the world will be

124
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,958
the beginning of a new era.

125
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:36,500
At last, I will exact my revenge
against those who mocked me.

126
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:42,166
I alone shall reign supreme as
Lord of the Kingdom of the Dead.

127
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,958
That's why...? That's why?

128
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,000
I can't believe you're about
to destroy all of Lodoss

129
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,083
over some petty revenge plot!

130
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,333
Now I'll never let you get
away with this! I swear it!

131
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,875
And you believe that
you can stop me?

132
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,375
Do not forget that within your
body is the soul of Naneel,

133
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,375
High Priestess of
Kardis the Destroyer.

134
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,291
And the one who
controls her is me!

135
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,625
[gasps]

136
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,291
I shall keep you here for
the time being so that

137
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,583
your mind and body
will remain pure.

138
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,291
The time of your sacrifice
is almost at hand.

139
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,250
[WAGNARD laughs]

140
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,583
[NEESE] I can't just sit here...
but there's no escape.

141
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,416
For now, I must have faith
in Marfa's divine protection,

142
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,666
and... and Spark...

143
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,583
Get ready, everyone.
Once we're over this hill,

144
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,875
we'll be very close.

145
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,708
Woo-hoo! Soon I'll be able
to finish my ballad

146
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,666
of the retaking of Kanon.

147
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,041
"And the free knight's
sword took down

148
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,708
the mighty black knight,"
I hope.

149
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,625
Why would you hope for that?

150
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,583
Hey, whose side are
you on, anyway?

151
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,083
Parn, look.

152
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,125
[PARN]
Hmm?

153
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,666
[SPARK]
This is the right thing to do.

154
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,875
It's the smartest and safest
way to get closer to Neese.

155
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,000
Even if it is just a small step,

156
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,750
at least it's a step in
the right direction.

157
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,458
[MAAR]
Whoa! Hey, everyone, look!

158
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,500
[SPARK gasps]

159
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,750
[SPARK]
Th-That must be...

160
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,416
[PARN]
Yes. The dark island of Marmo.

161
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,791
[ALL gasping]

162
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:00,208
[SPARK] She's there...
Neese is on that island.

163
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,416
[NARRATOR] As Parn and his group
unite with Prince Reona's forces

164
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,208
near Roodo, King Kashue
leads the victorious army

165
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:29,083
of Flaim from Alania
toward Roodo as well.

166
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,416
It is hoped that
the amassing force

167
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,583
will be sufficient to drive
the remaining Marmo

168
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,375
from the interior of Lodoss.

169
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,166
[NARRATOR] Back in the holy
capital of the kingdom of Valis,

170
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,666
having swept the Marmo forces
from his land in a holy war,

171
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,458
King Etoh loudly proclaims his
decision to engage the Marmo

172
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,041
in one final battle.

173
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,583
We have regained the
protection of Falis here

174
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:22,083
in our holy kingdom.
But the power of the dark god

175
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,416
still looms as a threat
to all of Lodoss.

176
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,041
So long as the God of Light
shines his protection over us,

177
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,250
let us join our allies
and smash the dark island!

178
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,041
Let us win a true and lasting
peace for all of Lodoss!

179
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,166
[cheering]

180
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,833
[KARLA] Where did I let
things go so wrong?

181
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,708
When I set the balance
of power in Lodoss,

182
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,791
it seemed so easy to control
the ambitions of kings.

183
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,250
Not anymore.

184
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,583
[REONA] We now know that
the Marmo forces hold Roodo

185
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,916
at four key positions.

186
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,875
[REONA] Once we break
through their perimeter,

187
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,875
we will have to hit their four
strongholds simultaneously.

188
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,625
This will eliminate
any chance for Ashram

189
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,500
to concentrate his
troops at the mansion.

190
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,083
[PARN] You're saying we
should hit them hard

191
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,750
while their forces
are still divided.

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,875
And if we hit them
all at the same time,

193
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,041
then Ashram and the Marmo
forces won't stand a chance.

194
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,791
That's exactly right.

195
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,333
Which leaves only
the question of

196
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,375
who will take the city center.

197
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,041
Your name's Spark, right?

198
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,541
Uh, yes, sir!

199
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,916
[REONA] I was thinking of
letting your group handle that.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,833
How 'bout it?

201
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:01,625
Huh?

202
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,875
What?

203
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,375
Your unit has a sorcerer,
a priest of Myrii,

204
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,541
and a grass runner,

205
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,458
which makes it the
strongest unit by far.

206
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,791
They also have a shamanist.

207
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,375
[SPARK]
Taking the city center?

208
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,583
They're giving such an important
duty to me? I don't believe it!

209
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,375
Taking the city center
shall require small numbers

210
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,833
and great mobility.
This is the right move.

211
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,458
I know you can do this, Spark.

212
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,791
Uh! Yes, sir!

213
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
[LEAF]
Hmm...

214
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,250
Huh?

215
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,833
It's a big role...

216
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
It sounds like fun.

217
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,791
Yes, of course!
You can count on us.

218
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,250
[REONA] Mm-hmm. We will
move into our positions

219
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,291
under the cover of darkness
and attack at first light.

220
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,416
And may the gods
protect you all.

221
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,791
[SOLDIERS]

222

[SOLDIERS chattering]

223
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,458
Boy, you dwarves really
are handy with the knife.

224
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,791
What is that thing?

225
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,333
Oh, this? It's just
a little toy.

226
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,791
A toy?

227
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,958
He's joking with you, Leaf.

228
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,750
That's going to become one
powerful little weapon.

229
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,333
[GREEVUS]
Don't listen to him, Leaf.

230
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,625
This really is nothing special.

231
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,291
[SPARK] Tomorrow... Tomorrow...
If this operation works,

232
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,208
the way to Marmo will be clear.

233
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,125
And once it is...

234
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,625
[RYNA] What're you
thinking about, Spark?

235
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,750
[SPARK] Ryna. Never mind,
it wasn't important.

236
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,291
[ALDO]
I know how you feel, Spark.

237
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,625
Try to relax.
Keep your head clear.

238
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,916
We have a most important
job to do tomorrow

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,416
and we cannot afford to fail.

240
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
[SPARK] Don't worry about me,
Aldo. I know what I must do.

241
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,666
I will not allow myself
to fail again.

242
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,125
Parn and the prince have
put their trust in me

243
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,750
and I must get to the dark
island to save Neese.

244
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,500
Please... All of you,
listen to me!

245
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,458
I need your support
now more than ever.

What? Karla?

251
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,125
Yes. If the reports we received

252
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,541
from other parts of Lodoss
are correct, it must be her.

253
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,208
The Gray Witch is here?
In Kanon? Why?

254
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:41,000
And at a time when a major
battle is about to begin...

255
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,750
I doubt that Karla would
ever ally herself

256
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,458
with the forces of
Valis or Flaim.

257
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,041
But, if she's making a
move here in Kanon....

258
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,791
Groder, what does
the Marmo council say?

259
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,416
Sir. What they always say.

260
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,375
We received a message telling us
to defend Roodo to the last man.

261
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,833
That was all that it said.

262
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,458
[ASHRAM]
Hmm. It's exactly the response

263
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
that I'd expect from them.

264
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,666
Very well. Pirotess!

[PIROTESS]
Sir!

266
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,416
I want you to
prepare some ships.

267
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,958
As many ships as you can find.

268
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,291
It seems the enemy's
allied against me

269
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,291
are not my only concern.

270
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,791
There's definitely something
else at work here.

271
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,250
Sir.

272
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,541
[ASHRAM] Dammit, Wagnard.
What are you up to?

273
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,833
[KARLA] The ancient kingdom
of Kastuul was destroyed

274
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,750
because the sorcerers
who lived there

275

forgot their limits
as human beings.

And, at this rate, if
the seeds taking root here

318
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,833
[PARN snores]

319
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,833
Well, well, if it ain't
that there sissy boy Parn.

320
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,750
[SPARK] Parn, you're the best!
You came to save us!

321
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:35,916
Uh, no. I just remembered
why I came.

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,458
Here, Spark. This is
for yo-- [screams]

323
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,041
[screaming]

324
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,083
[DARK ELF]
Whoopty-doo!

325
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,250
[NEESE, SPARK, DARK ELF]
We'll be seeing you!

326
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,250
[SPARK] The free army
begins to close in.

327
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,875
Their goal? To free Kanon
from the Marmo.

328
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,750
It's the free knight
versus the black knight

329
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,958
in a battle that will
determine the future.

330
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,958
And it's my only chance
to open a path

331
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,083
to the dark island of
Marmo and save Neese.

332
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,583
I cannot afford to lose!
Not this fight!

333
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,916
