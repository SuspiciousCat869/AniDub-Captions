1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,083
[NARRATOR]
The kingdom of Kanon,

2
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,333
which lies at the extreme
southern tip of Lodoss,

3
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,166
is a vital beachhead for
the invading Marmo forces.

4
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,541
In an effort to free his kingdom
from its Marmo invaders,

5
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,166
Prince Reona, the rightful
heir to the throne of Kanon,

6
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,708
has called a strategy session at
the fortress of the free army.

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,500
As you all know by now, Marmo
and Alania have joined forces

8
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,875
and are attempting to
take control of Lodoss.

9
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,416
We've heard reports that
their reach has extended

10
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,916
as far as the holy kingdom.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,458
To Valis...

12
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,541
Yes. I don't relish the
thought of those monsters

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,583
in the holy kingdom
either, Parn.

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,916
Parn...

15
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,583
If our forces can retake Kanon,
then the Marmo will immediately

16
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:01,208
lose their gateway into Lodoss,
cutting off their supply lines!

17
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,041
Right now, retaking
Kanon is the key

18
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,125
to the war for all of Lodoss!

19
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,916
My friends, for
the sake of Kanon

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,708
and the sake of all Lodoss,

21
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,875
isn't now the time to
end the Marmo aggression

22
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,083
once and for all?

23
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,208
[MEN cheering]

24
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,791
We're with you, Prince Reona!

25
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,416
Just give us the word!

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,625
[MEN cheering]

27
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,166
This guy's the real deal?
He's not exactly my idea

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,000
of what a real prince
is supposed to be--like!

29
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,291
Quiet!

30
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,916
A word, if I may.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,583
What do you know about the
rumor of a new Marmo governor

32
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,958
to replace Rabido?

33
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,000
Another reason why we should
accelerate our plan.

34
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,666
Our best move is a full-scale
attack while Governor Rabido

35
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
is still in command.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,416
It's a definite
advantage to fight

37
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,916
when you know how your
opponent will respond.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,916
Yes. I doubt that an ego maniac
like Rabido will give up

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,666
his post without a fight.

40
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,500
In fact, I have a feeling
that right now...

41
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,541
[RABIDO]
What did you say?!

42
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,125
What do you mean none of
our scouts have returned?!

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,375
Those patrols were fully
equipped for battle!

44
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,833
It cannot be possible that
all of them were killed!

45
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,250
Ah, well, sir...

46
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
The free army must've attacked
while our scout teams

47
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,125
were asleep in their tents.

48
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,791
Not a single one survived!

49
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
[RABIDO]
While they were asleep?!

50
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,041
You must be joking! Damn it!

51
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,666
Get me the captain
of the knights!

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,375
If my men can't do their jobs,
then they'll all be executed!

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,708
What's the matter?! Move it!

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,000
I know that you are
upset, Governor,

55
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,083
but the captain of the knights
is a very important man!

56
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,208
Executing a man
like him would have

57
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,666
grave consequences
for the war effort!

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, yeah...?

59
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,750
If the soldiers really
were caught sleeping,

60
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:58,041
then it must be their own fault
that they did not survive!

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,041
Lord Rabido, please!

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,833
If these executions continue,
then even our own troops will--

63
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,875
What will they do?

64
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,750
Uh... Uh...

65
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,250
Don't ever question me.

66
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
[RABIDO]
I am the governor of Kanon!

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,875
Disobeying my orders is treason
against Marmo itself!

68
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,625
I suggest you both
keep that in mind.

69
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,041
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

70
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,791
[ASHRAM] Be careful how
you define treason.

71
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,458
[RABIDO]
Huh?

72
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:40,041
The Council of Marmo has decided
that you are to be removed

73
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,041
from you position as governor.

74
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,916
If you intend to disobey
the council's will,

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,166
then you are a
traitor yourself...

76
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,916
...Rabido.

77
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,291
[RABIDO chuckles]

78
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,708
I find it rather difficult to
take you seriously, Sir Ashram!

79
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,958
Especially at a time when
winners live and losers die!

80
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:10,083
If I were to obey Marmo's laws,
I'd be as dead as you were

81
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,083
when you lost to Kashue
at Fire Dragon Mountain!

82
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:18,125
The council must be crazy to
send a dead man to unseat me!

83
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,916
One competent governor is
all that is needed here!

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,625
When I finish off those fools

85
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,750
who dare to stand
against the Marmo,

86
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,750
then the council will
have no issue with me!

87
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,791
That's assuming you
can pull it off.

88
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,666
[growls]

89
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,583
[RABIDO] All right! Gather
all of our forces at once!

90
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,625
This is war!
I'm going to wipe out

91
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,750
those partisans to the last man!

92
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,208
Are you sure we should let
him do this, Lord Ashram?

93
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,041
It doesn't matter.
Rabido is right.

94
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,125
I have already died.

95
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,416
I'm so sorry, my lord.

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,875
If I were able to use
my magic, my lord,

97
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,333
I could be of more
help to you now.

98
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,333
[ASHRAM] Enough, Groder.
Wagnard sealed your powers

99
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,500
because of what you did for me.

100
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,500
You saved me when
I should've died,

101
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,375
and you bore the brunt
of Wagnard's wrath.

102
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,541
I should be the one
to apologize.

103
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,500
But what are you saying, sir?

104
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,666
As your servant,
it is only natural

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,333
that I would've done
that for you.

106
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,333
It was back at Fire
Dragon Mountain.

107
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,708
When you lost to Kashue,
you lost your mind.

108
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,041
And when I cast that
teleportation spell to save you,

109
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,500
I did it because I
believe that you were

110
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,916
too important for Marmo to lose.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,416
Even though I broke Marmo's law
and lost my powers as a result,

112
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,208
I still have no regrets for
you are still here, my lord.

113
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,666
Then please put your
mind at ease, Groder.

114
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,833
And besides, you know
that I can easily

115
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,958
kill Rabido any time I want.

116
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,458
But why are you doing this?
Especially when the council's

117
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,916
already recognized you
as Rabido's successor.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,708
Why would you do what he says?

119
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,875
Pirotess... Do you
think I'm soft?

120
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,083
Oh, no...

121
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:31,375
However, if Rabido is successful
in destroying the free army...

122
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,250
Do not assume that I intend
to live on in shame forever.

123
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,541
Ever since Fire Dragon Mountain,

124
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,541
the thought has
not left my mind.

125
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,291
Why was I unable to beat him?

126
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:48,333
What am I lacking that allows
him to beat me every time?

127
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,291
I hope I will have
that answer soon.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,625
We will begin our
attack immediately!

129
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,416
Units 2 and 3 are to follow me!

130
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,916
Unit 1 will search the mountains
for the enemy's hideout!

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,916
And when you do
find their hideout,

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,416
you shall leave no one alive!

133
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,291
And the rest of you!

134
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,500
The remaining unit
will stay behind

135
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,916
and keep the villagers in line.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,625
Until this battle is over,

137
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,416
I don't want to see a
single person outside.

138
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,791
A-Are you saying that
you want us to lock

139
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,791
the villagers into their homes?!

140
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,083
If we use them as a shield,
then the free army

141
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,125
will have to think twice
before they attack us.

142
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,708
And if the free army is
stupid enough to resist us,

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,458
then you will...

144
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,458
[SOLDIER B]
Then we will what, sir?!

145
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,541
[RABIDO chuckles]

146
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,208
Then kill them all! You will
torch the entire village,

147
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,250
and burn everyone to death!

148
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,208
But sir! That would
be a barbaric act!

149
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,541
[RABIDO]
Quiet!

150
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,166
How dare you question one
of my orders, you worm!

151
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,166
Now, get moving before
I have you killed!

152
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,708
[SOLDIER B wails]

153
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,708
Why must I put up with idiots
who question my orders?!

154
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,000
This time, I will show them all.

155
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,416
[RABIDO chuckles]

156
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,250
[ASHRAM] A dam with even a tiny
hole cannot hold back a river.

157
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,708
Water flowing through small
cracks makes them even wider.

158

00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,625
were Kashue and yourself.

317
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,625
[HOBB whimpers]

318
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,416
[ASHRAM]
But remember this as well.

319
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,958
As long as you and I live,
our battle will never be over.

320
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,375
[REONA]
Eeyah!

321
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,541
[RABIDO grunts]

322
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,500
It looks like this is
the end for you, Rabido!

323
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,541
[yells]

324
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,291
[RABIDO whimpers]

325
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,416
[REONA bellows]

326
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,833
[SOLDIERS cheering]

327
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,916
[REONA]
It's over, Parn. We've won.

328
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,333
[DEEDLIT]
Parn...

329
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,291
[PARN]
We failed... We lost it all...

330
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:25,083
I never... I never thought
that he could still be alive.

331
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,041
I cannot believe it.
He's even greater.

332
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,708
He's returned from the dead

333
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:41,125
and he's even more kingly
than he was before.

334
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,875
Sir Ashram...

335
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,166
[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

336
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,333
And now, what you've
all been waiting for,

337
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,750
the second part!

338
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,875
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

339
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,833
Now where's that
Dark-freakin'-Elf

340
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,333
with that freakin' batch
of Neese's cookies, eh?!

341
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,000
Hey, boss, I'll lay
this freakin'--

342
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,083
how do you call it--eh,
"tart" is ready.

343
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,250
[ASHRAM]
Eh?! Gimme some!

344
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,916
No! Too freakin' sweet!

345
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,750
It's too freakin' sweet!
How many freakin' times

346
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
do I gotta say the same
freakin' thing?!

347
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,916
If the filling was sweet,
they wouldn't call it a "tart"!

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,458
Heh? Why am I so
concerned about this?

349
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,208
Here's why: I have been
going to therapy,

350
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,250
and I've learned that I
shouldn't have bad "fillings!"

351
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,125
[chuckles]

352
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,875
Boss, that was pretty good!

353
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,666
King Kashue ain't the only one
who can whack out a good pun.

354
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,916
Now listen up!

355
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,083
I'm gonna win over every
freakin' heart in Lodoss

356
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,166
with the most unbelievable
freakin' baked goods

357
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,416
ever freakin' baked.
And the best freakin' one

358
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,583
is gonna be my sweet
deli sandwich cookie!

359
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,500
That's why I gotta get my
hand on Neese's cookies!

360
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,500
Me and my freakin' bakery
are gonna take over Lodoss!

361
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,375
[laughs]

362
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,833
[NARRATOR]
At that moment...

363
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,791
[DEEDLIT] We're finally out
of that freakin' dungeon!

364
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,708
We had a lot of
really close calls,

365
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,958
but it was good to see Spark's
cheerful face again!

366
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,541
Yeah! And he gave us
these yummy cookies!

367
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,291
The thing is... I don't see why

368
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,125
we met up with Spark
in the first place.

369
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,958
You need to ask?!
We found out that Ashram

370
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,041
was up to something bad
with Neese's cookies!

371
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,250
That's why we came out
here to give Spark

372
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:31,791
this magic sword so he'll
be able to fight him!

373
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,166
Oh, yeah, the magic sword.

374
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,708
With this magic sword,

375
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,333
Spark will be able to complete
his mission with no problem.

376
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:39,833
[burps]

377
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,708
That one?

378
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,000
Ah.... I didn't give it to him.

379
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,208
[DEEDLIT]
Too freakin' bad!

380
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,833
[NARRATOR]
What will become of Spark?

381
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,416
Find out in our next
thrilling episode.

382
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,750
We'll be seeing you...

383
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,458
[SPARK] Just as we reached
the holy kingdom of Falis,

384
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,833
we are greeted with
an order to turn back.

385
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,250
If we can't convince
King Etoh of who we are,

386
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,250
there's no point in being here!

387
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,625
Is going back to Flaim
our only option?

388
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,750
But the other members of
the party won't give up.

389
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,625
And together, we're ready
to do whatever it takes.

390
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,875
