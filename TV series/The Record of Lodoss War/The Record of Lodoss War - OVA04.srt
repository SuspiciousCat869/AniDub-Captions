The final battle of the gods

Marfa, goddess of all creation,

162
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,375
[DEEDLIT] He's right.
The forest draws out

163
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,375
the reserves
of strength within you.

164
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
It's because feelings of
aggression and malice

165
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,791
don't exist here.

166

[SLAYN] Of course.

Time behaves differently
in different worlds.

00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
It passes more slowly here.

173

If we don't leave here soon,

174
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,708

cause us all to age.
