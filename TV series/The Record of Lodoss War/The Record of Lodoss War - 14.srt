It is your destiny.
You cannot fight it.

Please, stop! No!

11
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,500
What's wrong?!

12
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,750
I-It must be...
the dark nightmare!

13
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,375
It is the will of the gods.

14
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,291
I am following a dark nightmare.

[WAGNARD] So, they combine
their powers to interfere!

00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,708
Heh... But it doesn't matter.

32
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:31,000
I already possess the first
key... the Soul Crystal Ball.

33
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:35,833
And when I acquire the
second key, we will meet again.

00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,958
[WAGNARD laughs]

35
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,041
Lock the fortress gates!

36
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,625
Split into two groups!

37
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,125

[knocking]

39
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,708
The intruder may
have been a Dark Elf

40
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,500
looking for revenge.

41
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,750
It is safest for
you to remain here.

42
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,583
Leave the rest to us.

43
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,416
He's got no clue.

44
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,791
There's no way a
Dark Elf could do this.

45
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,916
Well, we just can't sit
around here doing nothing.

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,333
Am I right?

47
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,875
[ALDO]
Forget it.

48
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,041
The one who did this
is nowhere near us.

49
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,375
As Leaf said, this is not
the work of Dark Elves.

50
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,250
I don't think the real enemy
will attack again anytime soon.

51
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,125
[ALDO]
So for now, we can do nothing.

52
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,500
Aldo...

53
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,916
The dark nightmare...

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
[gasps]

55
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,500
That is what I
heard you say before.

56
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,458
Aldo, I think you know what's
going on here. Don't you?

57
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,875
[SPARK]
Then tell us what it is, Aldo!

58
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,708
Why did this happen to Neese?

59
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,541
What is going on here?!

60
00:05:55,625 --> 00:06:00,458
[ALDO sighs] It's just...
It's just that...

61
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,541
Aldo!

62
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,958
A-All right. I'll tell. But you
should prepare yourselves.

63
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,833
After you know the truth,

64
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,583
nothing will ever
be the same again.

65
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,083
[GARRACK]
Heh, what's that supposed mean?

66
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
You'll see...

67
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
[SPARK]
Wh-What did you say?!

68
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,083
That stolen crystal ball is
the key to reviving Kardis?!

69
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,875
[ALDO]
Yes, it is.

70
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,041
Kardis is the
Goddess of Destruction,

71
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,208
her only purpose is to
destroy the entire world.

72
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,500
If Kardis is revived,
it'll be worse than war!

73
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,333
All of Flaim and all of Marmo

74
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,041
will be destroyed
at the same time!

75
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,416
I had no idea

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,291
that the treasure we're
chasing was this important.

77
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,166
There is an ancient legend.
Is says:

78
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,166
Two keys and one door,
and Kardis shall live once more.

79
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,333
But, what does it mean?

80
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,791
[ALDO] When two objects
for the advent of Kardis

81
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,041
are brought together,

82
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,541
and a special sacrifice is made,

83
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,458
the Goddess of Destruction
shall be reborn.

84
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,416
One of the objects is
the Soul Crystal Ball

85
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,125
which has the power
to resurrect the dead.

86
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,791
The other is the Staff of Life,

87
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,958
which is able to heal
all wounds on a body.

88
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,875
But, you also said something
about a special sacrifice.

89
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,000
That special sacrifice
is the person

90
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,458
who has received
the soul of Naneel--

91
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,250
the High Priestess of Kardis

92
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,666
who was killed during
the War of Heroes.

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,875
And it is Neese's mother,
the priestess Leylia,

94
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,750
who has received that soul.

95
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,416
[ALL gasp]

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,916
There are two keys
and one door...

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,458
And the evil had
of the dark wizard

98
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,125
is at the center of it all.

99
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:57,000
The dark nightmare...
It's Wagnard.

100
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,000
[gasps]

101
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,500
Hey, hold on a minute.

102
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,208
Why is he going after Neese?

103
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,750
If what you just said is true,

104
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,875
shouldn't he be going
after Leylia? Well?

105
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,833
[ALDO] That's what everyone
assumed from the beginning.

106
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,791
However...

107
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,625
It is said that the
sacrifice must be young

108
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,916
and of pure blood.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,250
So when Leylia gave
birth to a child,

110
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,875
she was no longer qualified
to be the sacrifice.

111
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,708
[ALDO] And since Leylia's blood
was ultimately passed down

112
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,416
to her only daughter...

113
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,666
But... But that means--

114
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,500
[NEESE]
Yes. I am the one.

115
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,750
I am "The Doorway"
and now you know.

116
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,000
[ALDO] When she
learned of her destiny,

117
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:50,208
Lady Neese set out on her own
to prevent Kardis' resurrection.

118
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,791
Prepared to face the
darkest of sorcerers.

119
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,458
This... This young girl...
An innocent.

120
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,125
She's committed
no sin of her own!

121
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,625
It... can't be...

122
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:11,166
[birds chirping]

123
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:26,208
Does all of this news suddenly
shock you, Master Spark?

124
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,291
Yes.

125
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,833
Uh! I mean, no! I mean...

126
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,875
It's all right.
I was shocked, too,

127
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,875
when I first learned about this.

128
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,583
But now...

129
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,666
[SPARK]
I... I'm sorry! Because we-- No,

130
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,666
because I did not recover
the Soul Crystal Ball.

131
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,125
[NEESE] Master Spark,
it wasn't your fault.

132
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,333
Please, just call
me Spark, okay?

133
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,875
[laughs]

134
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
Okay. Just Spark, then.

135
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,416
Please don't torture
yourself over this.

136
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,375
This is my fate and I accept it.

137
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,250
Even if the crystal ball
had never been stolen,

138
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,500
this still would have happened.

139
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,875
Yes, but how...? You're fighting
against a dark wizard!

140
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,708
How can you possibly
expect to beat him?

141
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,708
You really should find a safe
place to hide instead.

142
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,750
You've already seen it yourself.

143
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,625
There's no safe place for me
to hide from Wagnard's reach.

144
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,250
So why should I try?

145
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,916
[SPARK]
Huh? Oh...

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,833
It's all right.

147
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:33,125
And besides, the battle hasn't
been decided yet, Spark.

148
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,375
My next step is to make
sure that the Staff of Life

149
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,375
is still safe.

150
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,416
The Staff of Life?!

151
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,875
[SPARK] Of course! If they
can't get the other key,

152
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,208
then Neese's bloodline
wouldn't make a difference!

153
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,958
I believe that the Staff of Life

154
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,125
is held in the holy
temple of Valis.

155
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,833
If it's guarded by the holy
royal knights of Valis,

156
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,916
then we're safe.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,333
Valis...

158
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,875
[GARRACK]
What?! We're setting out again?!

159
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,416
You heard me!

160
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,583
Now that we know the
crystal ball isn't here,

161
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,291
I can see no point in us
hanging around anymore!

162
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,458
And we've still got this.

163
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,666
[GREEVUS] Uh? The dispatch
from King Kashue

164
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,000
to King Etoh of Valis.

165
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,958
[SPARK] Now we can deliver
the king's message.

166
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,708
And perhaps I can help to
keep Neese safe as well.

167
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,750
[SPARK] All right,
prepare yourselves at once!

168
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,208
We have a vital duty to
get this message to Valis!

169
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,291
We are leaving right away.

170
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,916
Actually, going to Valis
now is a very good idea.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,125
And if we're lucky, we may
even come across the courier

172
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,916
with the stolen crystal ball.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

174
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
What are you saying?

175
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,833
Just think about it.
If the crystal ball

176
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,125
has already been handed
off to a courier...

177
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,250
...the fastest way for
someone to get it to Marmo

178
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,666
is to get a ship at the
port of Roodo in Kanon.

179
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,583
And since Kanon is already
under Marmo occupation,

180
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,208
it would also be the safest way.

181
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,208
It's just common sense when
you really think about it.

182
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,833
But aren't Flaim's forces
covering all of the roads

183
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,916
leading to Kanon?

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,833
You're right, Leaf.

185
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:25,291
That means they'll have to
find a back door out of here.

186
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,458
[GARRACK] The only way to
reach Marmo is by sea.

187
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,041
And if you can't use
Roodo to get a ship...

188
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,583
[SPARK] Of course! You'd have to
go to the port of Roid in Valis!

189
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,125
Now you've got it!

190
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,250
So going to Valis is smart.

191
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,375
Hey, you think like a thief.

192
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,000
Watch your mouth.

193
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,500
[GARRACK, RYNA]
Mm?

194
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,833
You're right, Ryna! Now we might
still recover the crystal!

195
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,666
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much, Ryna!

196
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,458
Please, you really don't
have to thank me... Heh.

197
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,208
[GARRACK]
Sheesh, how naive can you get?

198
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,000
Now all we've
got to think about

199
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,291
is how to handle
that dark wizard.

200
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,750
[ALL]
Mm...

201
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,166
We already know that
he can appear anywhere

202
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,541
he wants to, right?

203
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,750
Now, if he targets us
while we're traveling,

204
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,125
it could be trouble.

205
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,125
[ALDO] We won't have to
worry about him for a while.

206
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,458
[ALL]
Huh?

207
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,958
Long ago, the master
wizard Ralkas

208
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,125
placed a curse on all dark
wizards as punishment

209
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,833
for staining their hands with
the practice of black magic.

210
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,250
[ALDO] Since then, whenever a
dark wizard uses magic,

211
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:39,041
he must endure excruciating
pain throughout his body.

212
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,166
But then, this guy must...

213
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,583
Indeed. He cast that spell in
spite of the terrible pain

214
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,041
it caused him.

215
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,208
To have that kind of will
means he's no ordinary man.

216
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,791
Yes. But even the most
powerful dark wizard

217
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,250
would need time to recover after
casting a spell like that.

218
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,625
It will be a while
before we see him again.

219
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,666
And even if he does decide to
appear again, fine with me.

220
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,750
I shall protect Neese
with my own two hands!

221
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,541
You're so brave!

222
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,250
[SPARK] I will not allow Wagnard
to lay a finger on Neese!

223
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,458
No matter what!

224
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,500
[LEAF] Especially since
she's one of us now!

225
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,166
Right, everybody?

226
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,666
[GARRACK]
Right.

227
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,250
Thank you all.

228
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,416
Man. I never expected this.

229
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,916
All we were supposed to do was
keep our hotheaded captain safe.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,750
Well, now. Are we scared because
we're facing a dark wizard,

231
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,291
Mr. Blue Meteor?

232
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,791
[growls] Shut your mouth!
You know that's not the point!

233
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,666
I'll see this thing through,
no matter what!

234
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,750
[RYNA]
Hmph.

235
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,500
[GARRACK grunts]

236
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,416
Well, now that we've got a plan,

237
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,750
why don't you give us
your orders, Captain?

238
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,791
[SPARK]
All right, everyone, let's go!

239
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
To the holy kingdom of Valis!

240
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,666
[NARRATOR] With fervent hope
and some nagging fears,

241
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,166
Spark and the others set out
for the holy kingdom of Valis.

242
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,458
At the same time, hoping to
free Kanon from Marmo control,

243
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,541
Parn and Deedlit ride
toward the secret base

244
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,958
of Kanon's free army.

245
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,833
Ahh. We finally made it.

246
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:39,500
Our new base is the hidden
fortress of Kanon's free army.

247
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,833
Eh...? That's it...?

248
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:49,083
[SOLDIERS chattering]

249
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,125
[MAAR] When I heard there
was an army of partisans

250
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,416
taking on the Marmo,

251
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,458
I expected their fortress to
be a little more impressive.

252
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,750
[sighs]

253
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,958
This place might as well
be a bandit's hideout!

254
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,250
Ah, well. Guess there
won't be any big

255
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,666
welcoming feast for us tonight.

256
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,333
Have you forgotten
that we're at war?

257
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,875
And we're actually
behind enemy lines?

258
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,791
What did you expect?

259
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
Really. You wanted
to come along.

260
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, you could always
go home by yourself Maar.

261
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,500
[MAAR] Uh, oh. I guess the elf
princess must be mad at me

262
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,083
for getting in the way of her
lovely, romantic trip with Parn.

263
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,291
Maar!

264
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,875
[sighs]

265
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,083
[HOBB]
Huh? Oh...

266
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,916
Parn! Deedlit!

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,666
It's been a while, Priest Hobb.

268
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,000
You're well?

269
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,250
Huh? I don't believe it!
It's Priest Hobb!

270
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,291
[HOBB]
Maar? What are you doing here?

271
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,166
Huh? We've got Kanon
trapped by the Marmo,

272
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,958
a free army amasses
to fight them,

273
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,250
and Parn's come to lead!

274
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,916
If you ask me, it's got
"saga" written all over it!

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,541
Sure it does.

276
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,708
l thought you were on a quest to
find true heroes, Priest Hobb.

277
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,625
And it's always led me
back to the same place.

278
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,250
Please, come inside.

279
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,291
Everyone's been
awaiting your arrival.

280
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,375
[PARN] Have there been any
new developments, Hobb?

281
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,750
The situation in the
villages remains the same.

282
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,166
But there's disturbing news.

283
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
What is it, Priest Hobb?

284
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,916
It seems the Marmo Council
is not too happy

285
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,958
with Governor
Rabido's dictatorship.

286
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,000
It looks like we'll be getting
a new governor any time now.

287
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,541
l doubt that the peoples'
anger will subside

288
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,666
just because the Marmo
council is sending

289
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,000
a new tyrant to rule over them.

290
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,416
Perhaps. But a new ruler will
mean a change in our strategy.

291
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,333
That's why Prince Reona
is waiting to fill you in.

292
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,083
[PARN]
Very good. Let's go.

293
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
Who is Prince Reona?

294
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,333
He's the leader
of the free army.

295
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,750
Prince Reona is
the only rightful heir

296
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,875
to throne of Kanon.

297
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,916
I can't believe it.
Another hero fighting

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,083
to protect and preserve
the future of Lodoss.

299
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:27,000
Ah, ha, ha! My poet's
blood is boiling up!

300
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,833
[MAAR laughs]

301
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,750
[RABIDO laughs]

302
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,625
[RABIDO]
My treasures are still fabulous!

303
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,708
No matter how many
times I look at them.

304
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,916
[laughs]

305
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,041
[RABIDO sighs]

306
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,625
[RABIDO] Precious gems are
like tasty bits of food to me!

307
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,833
Oh, I like this governor
business just fine!

308
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,750
[RABIDO laughs]

309
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,375
[RABIDO] Hm?! Hey, Slaves!
Bring me some more wine!

310
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,458

[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

314
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,250
And now, what you've
been waiting for,

315
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,458

Ah-ha!

317
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,375
Now, to bring you
all up to date...

318
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,291
We're still wandering
around in this cavern.

319
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,041
We've been walkin' in circles.

320
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,041
Spark's got no freakin'
sense of direction.

321
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,083
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ha, ha!

322
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,375
How come you're
being so mean?! Waa!

323
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,791
If I knew it was
gonna be like this,

324
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,041
I'd have stayed in Flaim
and picked up chicks!

325
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,166
[PARN] This is no time
to be blowing your nose!

326
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,875
Who are you?! Show yourself!

327
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,666
Gee! You're so brave!

328
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,833
[SPARK]
Ahh!

329
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,875
[NEESE, SPARK scream]

330
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,458
[LITTLE DRAGON]
Yee-haw!

331
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,041
[PARN] Running away is
really embarrassing, Spark!

332
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,250
Could that be...?

333
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,875
Yes! It's Parn!

334
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,916
[PARN]
Well, it ain't your momma!

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,083
[belches]

336
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,250
I've been running
around this stupid place

337
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,708
for over a month now!

338
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,458
[BOTH yelp]

339
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,291
We're so hungry!
Please give us food!

340
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,416
[PARN] Here's an important
lesson for you, Spark...

341
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,625
A knight must
always be prepared.

342
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,708
[DEEDLIT] Yeah! Always make
sure you have enough food.

343
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,083
Hey! Who's teaching who here?!

344
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,541
But it's okay!

345
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,416
You guys missed me so much
that you came out searching!

346
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,166
Hey! A camera!

347
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,291
Air time!

348
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,041
[SPARK] I've tried to follow
all of your advice, Parn.

349
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,958
Like, no matter what plan
I choose to follow,

350
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,708
I shouldn't get careless.

351
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,583
No matter what, I'm going
to complete this mission

352
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,166
and become a great knight!

353
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,708
So, from now on...

354
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:36,208
Hey, Parn! Deedlit! Hey!
What are you doing?!

355
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,166
Hi!

356
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
They're so starved for air time,

357
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,375
they'll do anything
to get on camera now.

358
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,791
Just cut it out!

359
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,083
This is our TV show now!

360
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,291
[laughs]

361
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,458
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

362
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,458
[PARN] The free army rises up to
save Kanon and smash the Marmo!

363
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,000
As we begin the battle,

364
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,791
the Black Knight, who we last
saw at Fire Dragon Mountain,

365
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,833
reappears with a new ambition!

366
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,416
Once again,
we must face the man

367
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,250
who wields the
demon sword, Ashram!

368
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,625
Next time,
on Record of Lodoss War:

369
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,333
Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:

370

Reunion with the Black Knight."
