Light and darkness...

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,666
The final battle of the gods
climaxed in a clash between

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Marfa, goddess of all creation,

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,625
and Kardis, goddess
of destruction.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,666
At the end of their
fierce battle,

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,791
the stricken goddesses
had split the continent,

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
forming a new land.

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Since then, people have come
to call this new continent

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,333
"Lodoss - The Accursed Island."

This sword calls
for the beast's blood.

[PIROTESS] And for that,
you will first need

The "Dragon's Path"?

91
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,916
[ORSON] It sounds
like an old legend.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,791
Yes. In Flaim lore, there is
the ancient legend

93
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,583
of the Dragon Slayer.

94
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,875
At the end of the Dragon's
Path supposedly lies

95
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,416
the dragon's fortress.

96
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,125
I get it. It's a back door
to Shooting Star's lair.

97
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,625
Right, Shadam?

98
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,416
Exactly. In the past,
many warriors set out

99
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
with the dream of becoming
the Dragon Slayer.

100
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,125
But none have ever returned.

101
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,666
It's a gamble.

102
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,625
Indeed, but I can see
no other way for us.

103
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,250
What do all of you think?

104
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,625
It's risky.

105
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:18,583
It's definitely risky,
but not suicidal.

106
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,166
There is another
part of the legend.

They'll help us to seal
the dragon's evil.
