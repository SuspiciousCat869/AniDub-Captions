1
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,166
Now, kill me. Go ahead.

2
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,750
[SHIRIS sobbing]
Orson... Orson...

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,083
[SHIRIS]
Orson!

4
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,958
[SHIRIS] You idiot!
You were finally cured,

5
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,750
and then, for my sake...

6
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,291
For my sake, you died.

7
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,291
You fell in love
with me and you died!

8
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,833
[SHIRIS]
But you died for nothing...

9
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,208
You died for nothing.

10
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,041
You died for nothing!

11
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,875
No, Deed.

12
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,541
[ASHRAM]
Ah...

13
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,250
[HOBB]
Can it be?

14
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,791
This is it, Sir Ashram.

15
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,083
There's no doubt.

16
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,375
The Governor's Treasure
is mine at last.

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,333
The Scepter of Domination!

18
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,791
And with it...

19
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,416
And with it, I shall turn
Lodoss into my own kingdom!

20
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,750
I alone shall fulfill Emperor
Beld's dream of a united Lodoss!

21
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,666
The day I have
longed for is at hand.

22
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
[HOBB]
As you deserve.

23
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:51,041
[ASHRAM groans]

24
00:03:55,041 --> 00:04:00,166
[roars]

25
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,125
Impossible! How could
he have returned?!

26
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,875
I thought the dragon
had gone off to feed.

27
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,375
Sir Ashram, you can't!

28
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,458
Let's wait for Groder
and the others to join us!

29
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,333
Yes.

30
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:18,375
[roars]

31
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,333
[KASHUE] According to the
magical spell put upon him

32
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,333
by the governor of Kastuul,
as long as there are men

33
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,875
who desire the
Scepter of Domination,

34
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,333
Shooting Star cannot stray
too far from his nest.

35
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,875
It's King Kashue!

36
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,833
It has been a while,
Priest Hobb.

37
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,666
But it's been far longer,
Sir Ashram, since we last met.

38
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,583
[scoffs]

39
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,541
[chuckles]
It's been a while,

40
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,541
but I still have not been
able to forget your face,

41
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,166
Kashue of Flaim.

42
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,041
[KASHUE]
Shall we end things here?

43
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,083
We both know that if
we are to survive,

44
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,708
the dragon must die.

45
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,875
I want to know if
you will help me.

46
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,791
[ASHRAM]
Are you insulting me?

47
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,291
There is no way that you
and I will ever become allies,

48
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,916
so calm down.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,375
The truth is that I
happen to hate Shoot Star

50
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,583
far more than I hate you.

51
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,125
Dragons and people
aren't the same.

52
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,666
Shooting Star is
an inconvenience,

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,125
but I do not hate him.

54
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,208
I do, however, hate you.

55
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,875
[KASHUE]
Let us work together first.

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,583
There will be time
enough for our duel

57
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,208
after the demon dragon is dead.

58
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,833
You mean...

59
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,958
[KASHUE] I've heard that
the Scepter of Domination

60
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,333
has the power to make
even your enemies obey you.

61
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,000
First, we'll kill the dragon.

62
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,458
Then, you and I and
our men will fight,

63
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,458
and the ultimate victor
will be the one

64
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,666
to control the
Scepter of Domination!

65
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
An interesting offer.

66
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,708
But I've already seen your
dirty tricks in a fight.

67
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,125
Or have you forgotten the way

68
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,291
you took advantage
of Emperor Beld?

69
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,625
[KASHUE]
I have no excuses to offer.

70
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,750
But at the time,
there was no other way.

71
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,750
And yet, you dare to call
yourself a man of honor.

72
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,125
You broke the rules of combat,
and you feel no shame?

73
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,375
Please, Sir Ashram,
what are you talking about?

74
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,000
It was five years ago.

75
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,708
He was fighting
Beld in the War of Heroes.

76
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,916
[KASHUE panting]

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,375
[ASHRAM] They were engaged
in single combat,

78
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,875
when someone launched an arrow,

79
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,333
striking Emperor Beld
in the arm.

80
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,583
[BELD gasps]

81
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,458
[yells]

82
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,500
In a brazen act of cowardice,

83
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,791
he took advantage of the
moment to win the fight.

84
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,958
The fate of Lodoss was in
my hands; I had no choice.

85
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,541
If I had not won that
sword fight with Beld,

86
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,333
then Marmo certainly
would have won the war.

87
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,541
But what--what are you saying?!

88
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,041
Will the god of war
condemn me for that?

89
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
Will Myrii curse my
name as a knight

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,291
for having saved all of Lodoss?!

91
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,208
[HOBB]
Um, well, uh... I, uh...

92

[KASHUE]
Parn!

94
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,208
There's no need for you to make

95
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,958
any deals with them,
Your Highness.

96
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,041
My team has already
taken care of Ashram's men.

97
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,291
Groder and the
others were beaten?!

98
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,416
Im-Impossible!

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,541
Come on, let's finish
these two off.

100
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,750
And then, we can go destroy
Shooting Star by ourselves.

101
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,083
[KASHUE]
Parn!

102
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,041
I will honor the agreement
I have made with Ashram.

103
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,625
It is my duty as
a knight... and as a king.

104
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,916
[PARN gasps]

105
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,333
[KASHUE]
We will kill Shooting Star...

...together!

107
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,250
You heard the agreement?

108
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,708
Yes, I did, sir.

feel the wrath of Myrii!"

Kashue from the dragon's flames!

Leylia! Cast a protection spell!

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,416
Right!

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,666
And Cecil, I want you
to cover King Kashue!

116
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,625
You don't have to tell me twice!

00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,625
And now, it's time for
"How, What, and Why!"

327
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,625
Time for question number one.

328
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,958
[GIRL VOICE] "Could you explain
how King Kashue beat Ashram?"

329
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,791
That was our first question.

330
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,750
And for the answer,
let's go to Shiris,

331
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,583
our ace field reporter.

332
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,791
Okey-dokey, Shiris.
Take it away!

333
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,583
This is Shiris, coming to
you from castle Akroyd!

334
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:39,333
We're trying to find out how a
laid-back guy like Kashue, uh...

335
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,875
Uh, how a guy like Kashue
was able to defeat

336
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,875
a dedicated guy like Ashram.

337
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,416
It looks like we may be
close to an answer.

338
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,375
[KASHUE] It wasn't a very
difficult thing to do.

339
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,083
You know I had to beat him.

340
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,791
After all, I am
the king of Flaim!

341
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,708
Yes, but what about Ashram's
famous Soul Crusher,

342
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,833
the demon sword? Weren't you
scared it would beat you?

343
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,125
[KASHUE grunts]

344
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,041
I'll tell you about that sword.

345
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,375
[SHIRIS yelps]

346
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,583
[clears throat] King Kashue,
should I be telling

347
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,875
our quip-happy
audience to get ready?

348
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,541
Yes! For I shall not be gored...

349
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,625
...by just any old demon sword!

350
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,666
[thumping]

351
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,583
[KASHUE whimpering]

352
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,375
Here's our next question!

353
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,916
[GIRL'S VOICE]
"What was the War of Heroes?"

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That was a very good question.

355
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,250
Now then, why don't we touch
upon the War of Heroes,

356
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,750
which happened five years ago

357
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,083
between Emperor Beld
and King Fahn.

358
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,166
[BOTH]
Well, we touched it!

359
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,833
[ALL groaning]

360
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,541
Well, that's it for today!

361
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,916
So long for now! Goodbye!

362
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,208
Bye...!

363
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,416
Bye!

364
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,666
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

365
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,541
[PARN] Ten years have
passed since the showdown

366
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,125
at Fire Dragon Mountain.

367
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,583
As the time slipped by,

368
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,500
the heroes went
their separate ways.

369
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,166
And, as the history of
Lodoss has shown before,

370
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,083
a young knight is given
a new mission to follow.

371
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,041
Next time,
on Record of Lodoss War:

372
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,958
Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:

373
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,625
"The Young Knight...
Tested Strength."
