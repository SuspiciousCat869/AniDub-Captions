1
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,500
[PARN]
Hm?

2
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,458
[SOLDIER A]
Here he comes!

3
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,166
[DEEDLIT]
Huh?

4
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,375
[SOLDIERS chattering]

5
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,500
That's him!

6
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,625
It's Shooting Star...

7
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,875
Finally...

8
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,541
Our enemy has come back.

9
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,583
And... he looks real mad.

10
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,291
That Ashram is
some slave driver!

11
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,916
He really expects us
to leave in two days?

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,958
Yeah! And I thought being a
pirate was gonna make me rich!

13
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,458
[flute playing]

14
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,125
[PIRATE A]
Who's that?

15
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,708
What the--?
What's he doing here?

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,625
Well, at least we got
something to look at. Right?

17
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,250
[chuckles]

18
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,750
[SHIRIS yells]

19
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,291
Who do you think you are?!

20
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, that's that.

21
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,208
Hope you enjoyed the show!

22
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,791
What a girl. I'm scared!

23
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,625
You see? I told you, Orson.

24
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,291
I didn't need any backup!

25
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,791
[chuckles]

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,041
[ORSON]
You were right.

27
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,416
All right, then. Let's go!

28
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,708
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
Slayn and Leylia,

29
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,208
who stayed behind in Raiden to
gather a crew for their ship,

30
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,291
learned the shocking
truth from a sailor

31
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,916
who had fled a pirate attack.

32
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,291
Are you absolutely sure?

33
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,125
Do you know what you're saying?

34
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,708
Yeah... I saw it
with my own eyes.

35
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,750
The pirate ship is
really a military ship.

36
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,916
And Marmo's flag was
flying from the mast.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,708
The Marmo... Do you think
it could be Ashram?

38
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,958
Oh dear! What should we do?

39
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,291
There is only one thing
that we can do, I'm afraid.

40
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,958
We must believe in our friends
and wait for help to arrive.

41
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,625
Parn and the others are
due to return any day.

42
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,583
[SLAYN]
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,583
Parn...

44
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:15,625
[roaring]

45
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,583
It's him, Deed.

46
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,625
Please be careful.

47
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,958
[roaring]

48
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,458
[KASHUE]
Now is the time!

49
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,333
Let's put Shooting Star
to rest right now!

50
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
Prepare to attack!

51
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:45,958
[SOLDIERS yelling]

52
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,916
[KASHUE] Keep as much space as
possible between each company!

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,208
Don't underestimate
the dragon's flames!

54
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,291
Let's show that thing
what we're really made of!

55
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,500
Yes, sir!

56
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,750
Deed! I'll leave my
magical support to you.

57
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,291
Right, sir.

58
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,958
Now wait until you
can see him...

59
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,250
Right! But with this
much firepower,

60
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,958
I doubt even a dragon
would stand a chance!

61
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:24,291
I bet we'll pierce his heart
on the first attack!

62
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,791
[roars]

63
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,000
The wind... It stopped.

64
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,625
What's going on? Deedlit!

65
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,416
There!

66
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,250
Huh?!

67
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,791
What is it?

68
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,791
[screaming]

69
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,125
Are you all right? Deed!

70
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,458
Yeah, Parn!

71
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,750
Okay, here it comes.

72
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,208
It's too soon!

73
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,333
Wait for him to get closer
in before you fire!

74
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,041
[roars]

75
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,750
[screaming]

76
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,041
I'm gonna draw him in!
Deed, summon the spirits!

77
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,041
But Parn!

78
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,666
Cover Parn, men!

79
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,291
Hyah!

80
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,375
King Kashue... Parn...

81
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:35,166
[PARN] Over here, you! Come on!
That's it! Come and get me!

82
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,166
Now, fire! Fire!

83
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,125
Show that beast the
true honor of Flaim!

84
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,833
[roars]

85
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:53,000
[screaming]

86
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,791
[KASHUE]
Damn you!

87
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,041
Come on, Deed! Hurry up! Hurry!

88
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,041
[DEEDLIT]
This is the spot...

89
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:12,500
"Iruku, great king of the wind,
I call upon thy mighty power."

90
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,250
[DEEDLIT] "Make the wind
become your sword,

91
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,750
and strike the demon dragon
with your whirlwind!"

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,750
[roars]

93
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,125
The wind blew him away!

94
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Now, you die.
This madness must stop.

95
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,208
[yells]

96
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,333
[KASHUE yells]

97
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,250
How dare you!

98
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,500
Feeble humans,
you will never kill me.

99
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,500
I shall destroy your cities.

100
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,458
A hundred humans shall die

101
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,041
for every scale you
have scratched.

102
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,625
I will kill every
last one of you.

103
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:58,958
[DEEDLIT]
Parn!

104
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,416
[PARN]
I'm... I'm all right...

105
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,375
[SOLDIER B] If only our army
had even one sorcerer...

106
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,083
We have lost...

107
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,041
An utter and complete failure...

108
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,000
[GRODER] Sir Ashram,
it appears some people

109
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,416
have infiltrated our defenses.

110
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,833
Infiltrators?

111
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,083
Yes. And by the way, Smeddy...

112
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:31,083
One of them will give you
a run for your money.

113
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,125
There's a woman with
them who is younger

114
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,791
and far more beautiful than you.

115
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,500
Can there really be
a woman like that?

116
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,666
It sounds too good.

117
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,416
Astar, what do you think?

118
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,708
Gaberra, don't get
your hopes up.

119
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,000
Any woman is beautiful
compared to Smeddy.

120
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
[snickers]

121
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,125
[GILRAM]
Smeddy has a beautiful body.

122
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,500
She's very strong.
That's what I think.

123
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,375
That's all right, Gilram.

124
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,708
A warrior has no
need for beauty.

125
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,708
Strength is all that matters.

126
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,458
And I'll prove
that to all of you.

127
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,958
[ASHRAM chuckles]
Isn't this interesting?

128
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,166
Coming here with such a
small force to attack us...

129
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,541
Are they that good?

130
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,041
Or do they simply
not know their limits?

131
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,166
Or could they be foolish enough
to be coming after me?

132
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,583
I will test them
with my own hands!

133
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:25,625
[ASHRAM laughing]

134
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,791
Looks like we're here.

135
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,458
What do you think
you're doing? Let's go.

136
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,375
[SHIRIS]
What am I...? Uh...

137
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,375
[CECIL]
Uh, sorry.

138
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,708
Isn't that just like them?

139
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,958
There's a fortune
sitting right here,

140
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,000
and they're just
gonna ignore it!

141
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,708
[CECIL]
Get going, you!

142
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,458
[MAAR] That's the
pirates' ship, all right!

143
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,833
No doubt about it!

144
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,083
[SHIRIS] Good! Now we can
dispose of these pirates

145
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,500
and take the ship for ourselves.

146
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,166
[ORSON]
Marmo...

147
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,708
Wha--?!

148
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,958
Huh?! It's a Marmo ship?!
But that means--

149
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,375
And that means... Oh, you don't
suppose Ashram's onboard.

150
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,375
[ASHRAM]
I...

151
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,083
...am honored.

152
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,875
To think that my name is known
even by common thieves.

153
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,791
The black knight...
He must be Ashram.

154
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,833
So that's the little girl...

155
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,916
[SHIRIS gulps]

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
Don't be afraid, Shiris.
It's just talk.

157
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,250
Don't worry about me.
I'm a warrior, remember?

158
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,875
I want to know who
sent them here,

159
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,625
so make sure you
don't kill all of them.

160
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,375
Priest Hobb!

161
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,500
"A humble servant calls
upon the name of Myrii...

162
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:08,625
Gather the heroes here and
grant us thy divine protection

163
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,875
in the coming battle!
Give us resolve of iron

164
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,166
and the courage of
a thousand armies!"

165
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:25,166
[chanting]

166
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:32,208
So this is the legendary
power of the War God.

167
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:44,708
[chuckles] And I can feel the
power welling up inside me.

168
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,833
[yells]

169
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,416
You know, you're not
half bad, little girl.

170
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,125
[SHIRIS] I'm not your "little
girl," and my name is Shiris!

171
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,208
You think you're
pretty good, don't you?

172
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
Do not underestimate me!

173
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,416
Parn is the one who
taught me how to fight!

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,375
"And now, let the
manna of all creation

175
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,833
become the fires
of destruction!"

176
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,000
Aw, you gotta be kidding!
This guy's a real monster!

177
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,958
Who are you? I'll wager
that you work for Kashue!

178
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:40,041
If you will not answer,
then you will die!

179
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,500
[ASHRAM] The Soul Crusher
is reacting to him!

180
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,875
Who is this man?!

181
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,125
[CECIL] There's nothing
left to say! Now die!

182
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,291
[yells]

183
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,583
You were hardly worth
the effort, young man.

184
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,958
[MAAR]
Enough! Enough! You beat me!

185
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,500
I said I was sorry!

186
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,083
[whimpering]

187
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,250
"Let the manna of all
creation remake the air.

188
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,958
Commit his heart to slumber."

189
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,291
But what are you going to--?

190
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,291
Don't tell me that you're
getting winded already,

191
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,708
little girl.

192
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
That's really bad form.

193
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,666
What a fool.

194
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,541
Gotcha!

195
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,208
That was a real
lousy move, little girl.

196
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,208
[ASHRAM] Surrender!
You know you cannot beat me.

197
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
[ASHRAM]
Who is this man?!

198
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,875
[SHIRIS yelling]

199
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,375
[ORSON]
Shiris!

200
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,458
[gasps]

201
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,208
[growling]

202
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,541
[HYURI]
Rage... Destroy...

203
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,208
Destroy everything!

204
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:01,833
[gasps]

205
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,333
No!

206
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,208
This guy is really strong!

207
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,750
[growling]

208
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,291
So that is your true power.

209
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,500
You were only playing
with me until now.

210
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,625
Now you must face the power

211
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,375
of the demon sword,
Soul Crusher!

212
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,791
[yells]

213
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,625
[ORSON]
Wait. Don't go. Not yet.

214
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,208
I still have to beat this man.

215
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,083
I must save Shiris.

216
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,083
I still need your power!

217
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,750
Don't do it! No, Orson!

218
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,166
Please, don't do it.

219
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,041
Don't let it take control...
of your heart...

220
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,541
Are you... all right?

221
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,375
Yes, I am. I'm okay, Orson.

222
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,291
You're okay...

223
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,875
[ASHRAM]
You've lost to me.

224
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,541
Now surrender quietly,
otherwise...

225
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,083
Spare them for they
are not to blame.

226
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,625
I am their... leader.

227
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,125
I was a fool to think
that an army of men

228
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,666
would be able to
defeat a dragon.

229
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,958
[PARN] A hundred
people for every scale...

230
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,958
Now he must be stopped
once and for all.

231
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,250
[DEEDLIT] Parn...
What are we going to do now?

232
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,625
[KASHUE]
Until that beast is dead,

233
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,083
I am not worthy of my title.

234
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,958
Shadam, I want you to
gather up the wounded

235
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,541
and see them safely
back to Blade.

236
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,625
[SHADAM] B-But Your Highness!
What about you?

237
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,250
You can't--

238
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,041
Stop.

239
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,041
We're going to need
some powerful sorcery

240
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,416
if we're ever going
to beat that dragon.

241
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm going to Raiden
to see Slayn.

242
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
[NARRATOR]
King Kashue, Parn, and Deedlit

243
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,833
urge their steeds forward
as fast as they dared,

244
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,666
urgently racing to
the city of Raiden.

245
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,500
Meanwhile, Ashram and his crew

246
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,916
have set sail for
Blue Dragon Island,

247
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,583
taking Orson and
the others as well.

248
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Oh, Shiris...

249
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,416
--Welcome...
--...to Lodoss Island!

250
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
What you've all
been waiting for...

251
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,750
...the second part!

252
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,375
[giggles]

253
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,000
[NARRATOR] Parn and his gang,
hoping to slay Shooting Star,

254
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,458
have traveled to the fire
dragon's feeding grounds.

255
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,250
[ALL yelp]

256
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,000
You made me bump
right into Deedlit!

257
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,500
Would you mind doing it again?

258
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,875
I wonder when Shooting
Star is gonna show up!

259
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:18,958
I can't wait!

260
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,833
Ah! Where is he?

261
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,750
I wanna show him my stuff!

262
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,416
[grunting]

263
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,541
Oh, Parn, you're so strong!

264
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,250
[PARN screams]

265
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,125
Uh, did I say strong?

266
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,500
[chuckles]

267
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,416
The fiendish Shooting Star,
better not mess with me.

268
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,625
I'm King Kashue of Flaim!

269
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,625
[laughing]

270
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,958
Can it be?

271
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,458
It's him!

272
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,791
Oh, he's so cute!

273
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,083
[chirps]

274
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,250
You call this a dragon?

275
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,666
Isn't he the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

276
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,083
Come on, Shooting Star.
Now I'll show you...

277
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,333
...the true might of Flaim!

[chirps]

279
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,875
What have you done to the king?!

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,333
Aw, come on! Don't cry!

281
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,333
Now the dragon rights people
are gonna come after me.

282
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,708
This situation calls
for some magical help.

[KASHUE whispering]

284
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,208
But... Uh...

285
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,458
[KASHUE]
Now go to it!

"I summon thee, Iruku,

Ouch.

[DEEDLIT] Defeat.
And now, a new battle begins.

00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,541
Awakened from his long sleep,

295
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,291
the rage of the sea dragon
shakes the heavens!

296
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,458
The black knight's demon
sword lights the darkness!

297
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,208
And in the heart
of a berserker...

298
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,666
...a long-forgotten light
flares back to life!
