Well, looks like we

Who are you...?

19
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:33,291
[WAGNARD] So, Doorway... Nice of
you to come. I've been waiting.

20
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
[WAGNARD chuckles]

Hmm...?

22
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,458
[WAGNARD]
I see you found yourself

23
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,541
yet another body, Karla.

24
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,708
[KARLA] When you finally succeed
at gathering the two keys

25
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,708
and the Door, what will
you do then, Wagnard?

26
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,166
[WAGNARD]
I owe you no explanation, Karla.

27
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,958
But do not misunderstand
my intentions.

28
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,625
I shall not use my
powers against you.

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,958
But why, Kardis?
The goddess of Destruction

30
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,458
is too much for any man.

31
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,875
Why would you want to
resurrect the goddess

32
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,791
whose only intention is
to destroy all of Lodoss?

33
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,291
You gaze at the truth even now.

34
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:20,125
There is no way that you,
the Grey Witch, cannot be aware

35
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:25,250
of the enormous power that
lies inside of Lodoss.

36
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,500
The power of the alliance
between Valis and Flaim

37
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:33,458
now exceeds that of this
dark island of Marmo.

38
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,916
I'm surprised you haven't
broken this alliance up.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,291
Wasn't it you who said you must
destroy all centers of power

40
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,125
so as it prevents
another tragedy

41
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,916
like the Kingdom of Sorcery?

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,541
That was why you became
the Grey Witch, wasn't it?

43
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,833
To control the chaos of war
from behind the scenes,

44
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,375
thus insuring a
future for Lodoss?

45
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,666
You believed that by balancing
the powers of Light and Darkness

46
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,500
that you would lead Lodoss to
eternal prosperity, am I right?!

47
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,750
Do you really think that
the resurrection of Kardis

48
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,083
will help achieve that?

49
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,708
[WAGNARD] And what is
that supposed to mean?

50
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,791
[KARLA] Kardis hates the souls
of all living things.

51
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,541
What prosperity could there
possibly be in turning Lodoss

52
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:19,291
into a wasteland? Or, perhaps...

53
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,625
Perhaps your ultimate
desire is to rule over

54
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,958
a kingdom of ghosts, am I right?

55
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,291
Heh. You may believe
what you want to.

56
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,541
But the truth is,

57
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,041
that if you allow Valis
and Flaim to carry on

58
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,250
as they've been, they will no
longer be following the path

59
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,208
you set for them.

60
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,083
If resurrecting the Destroyer
means destruction of the Light,

61
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,916
then that is Lodoss' fate.

what I've said, Karla.

64
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,958
No one will stand in my way!

65
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,958
When this is over,
I shall reign supreme!

And I must settle things
with the dark wizard

once and for all.

ordered us to return to Flaim.

If you disobey him like this,

you'll never get to
be a knight, Spark.

made up my mind.

I'm ready to go to Marmo
right now. For Neese.

than following orders.

00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,166
--Ah!
--[DARK ELF groans]

323
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,000
Li'l Dragon!

324
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,583
[LITTLE DRAGON squawks]

325
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,958
[SPARK]
You saved me, Little Dragon!

326
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,416
By the way, what did
that letter say?

327
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,541
It said to be careful
on your trip.

328
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,125
That's it?! Hah!

329
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,416
Funny thing is, I feel
like I forgot something...

330
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,708
I'll never give up
there, little girl!

331
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,750
I'll get those cookies!

332
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,208
[NEESE, SPARK]
We'll be seein' you!

333
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,375
[SPARK]
With new resolve in our hearts,

334
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,291
we set out on our journey.

335
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,041
Can we make it safely through
Kanon and find our way

336
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,541
to the dark island?

337
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,791
We race through a forest
and are confronted by

338
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,458
terrible monsters
and Marmo mercenaries.
