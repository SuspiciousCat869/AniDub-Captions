1
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,791
[NARRATOR] It has been two days
since Orson and his comrades

2
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,666
were defeated by Ashram
at the pirates' hideaway.

3
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,041
Now captives, they are on their
way to Blue Dragon Island

4
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,833
aboard the Marmo military ship,
Sea Devil's Horn.

5
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,416
[ASHRAM] I see. I figured
they were sent from Flaim.

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,750
And with a berserker among
them... You're sure?

7
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,208
I sense the spirit's within him.

8
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,708
The spirit of anger
is most strong, indeed.

9
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:28,666
Hyuri can blaze to life
like burning hot lava.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,208
Fascinating.

11
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,250
And you're saying that
there's no way he can

12
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,083
consciously control his
berserker strength?

13
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,166
[ASTAR]
Impossible.

14
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,791
I see.

15
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,625
[ORSON] Except for the time
I felt the spirit of anger

16
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,000
releasing me from its spell.

17
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:50,750
I called it back because I
needed its power to fight.

18
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,833
Can it be that I don't really
want to escape Hyuri's spell?

19
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,083
Orson...

20
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,500
[door opens]

21
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,333
[SHIRIS]
Orson!

22
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,291
Sorry about that.

23
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,875
Why you!

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,166
Shiris, you're too
weak to try to move.

25
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
I'm all right.

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Lucky for you, I got a
little careless before.

27
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,083
You won't beat me again.
I swear it!

28
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,125
Oh, yeah? I'll take you
on any time, little girl.

29
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,375
Damn!

30
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,291
Shiris...

31
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,625
I'll beat her! I swear it!

32
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,375
[ORSON] Shiris, there's no way
you can beat that warrior.

33
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,958
You'll lose. You'll lose
every single time.

34
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,000
Back off! She's nothing
but a big brute!

35
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
In an honest sword fight,

36
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,916
there's no way she
would ever beat me!

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,666
[ORSON] In a strict test
of swordsmanship,

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,500
you probably would win.

39
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,875
But real battle is different,
and you know it.

40
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,416
Just drop it!

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,416
It's just like trying
to say you could beat me.

42
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
While you might be
able to hurt me,

43
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,916
I would be the one to
score the lethal wound.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,458
I said drop it! Come on!

45
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,833
You're way outta
line on this, Orson!

46
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,875
Next time, I won't lose!

47
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,708
And it's not for the sake
of Lodoss or Parn or--

48
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,291
It's for the sake
of my own pride!

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,958
I have to beat that woman!

50
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,125
[ORSON]
I'm sorry, Shiris.

51
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,625
I wasn't strong
enough, either...

52
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,583
Orson! You're crying!

53
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,583
Can it be that you've
learned how to feel again?

54
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,750
[NARRATOR] The Sea Devil's
Horn finally arrives

55
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:51,125
at Blue Dragon Island,
home of Abram the sea dragon.

56
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,458
At once, Ashram and
his group set out

57
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,916
to acquire the Scepter
of Domination,

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,750
the greatest of the
Governor's Treasures.

59
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,666
In order to have a living
witness to his greatest triumph,

60
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,458
Ashram has decided
to bring Orson along.

61
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,125
[HOBB] I hope Abram holds
the Scepter of Domination.

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,791
If he does, then your
journey will end

63
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,041
right here at Blue
Dragon Island.

64
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,208
You're wrong.

65
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,666
Once I possess the
Scepter of Domination,

66
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,625
our true battle will begin.

67
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,333
The battle to unite
Lodoss awaits us all.

68
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,708
Look there!

69
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,125
[ORSON]
That's Abram, the sea dragon!

70
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,375
[ASHRAM]
Let's go!

71
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,125
A moment, sir.

72
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,041
I would like to try
to negotiate with him.

73
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,291
[ASHRAM]
Negotiate?!

74
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,625
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,416
Very well.

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,291
[GRODER]
Thank you, sir.

77
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,375
I dare say, that if we can get
the scepter without a fight,

78
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,583
then nothing will
stand in our way.

79
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,416
Who dares to disturb
my slumber?

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,666
A human.

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,000
I could tell you my name,

82
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,375
but it would mean
nothing to you.

83
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:20,833
I have no use for puny,
little human beings.

84
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,791
I suggest you leave now.

85
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,916
I wish to sleep.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,958
Abram, I have a
question for you.

87
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,791
Is it true that you guard
the Scepter of Domination?

88
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,666
I do not. Now leave!

89
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,500
Then... what about the
Soul Crystal Ball?

90
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,083
[ABRAM]
I do indeed possess that.

91
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,416
[GRODER] Master Wagnard,
the search is over at last!

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,291
I've found the
Soul Crystal Ball!

93
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:54,291
Human! If you think
that you can succeed

94
00:06:54,375 --> 00:07:00,583
in stealing from me,
prepare, for you will die!

95
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,458
[GRODER] No, Abram.
It is you who will die today.

96
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,875
[ABRAM]
We shall see about that!

97
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:11,166
[roars]

98
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,166
I assume he said no.

99
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
That's right, sir.

100
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,041
And I'm sure that Abram does
not possess the scepter.

101
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,375
Hmph!

102
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,750
But he's angry with us
for disturbing his sleep.

103
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,208
Now he wants to devour us.

104
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,666
Then we must fight.
The berserker can stay behind.

105
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,416
[gasps]

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,958
Let's go!

107
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,750
Sing the song of battle!

108
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,791
The dragon's roar can shatter
even a warrior's resolve.

109
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,166
Protect us from it!

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,916
By your command!

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,958
[singing]

112
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,541
[ORSON] I... I'm scared.
I want... I want to run.

113
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,583
Can this be... fear?!

114
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,208
[ASHRAM]
Move out!

115
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,750
"I call forth the power
of the mighty kraken!"

116
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,208
[NARRATOR]
Abram's movements were dulled

117
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,208
by his recent hibernation.

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,583
He breathed fire,
thrashed his mighty tail,

119
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:36,291
and fought against the onslaught
of magical lightning attacks.

120
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
But in the end,
Abram could not withstand

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,750
the relentless attacks of
Ashram and his fighters.

122
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,833
Until finally...

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,708
[yells]

124
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,708
[ORSON]
Wha-- What are you doing to me?

125
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:16,250
[HOBB] "Myrii, give peace
to this man's heart."

126
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,125
You'll be all right.

127
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,541
[ORSON]
Y-You won?

128
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,916
We did somehow.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,541
And yet, there was
no point to this fight.

130
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,583
What is that thing, Groder?

131
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,541
Sir, this is the
Soul Crystal Ball.

132
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,875
Another of the
Governor's Treasures.

133
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,833
The Soul Crystal Ball...

134
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,375
It's used to summon the
souls of the dead, isn't it?

135
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,166
We still haven't studied it,

136
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,750
so I cannot give you
a definite answer.

137
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,041
You look quite happy, Groder.

138
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,958
Does it not upset you
that I must now do battle

139
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,041
with Shooting Star as well?

140
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,416
Please forgive my poor manners.

141
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,833
But I just cannot wait
to begin my study

142
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,375
of this most fascinating object.

143
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,291
Hm. We must set out for Flaim.
Then to Fire Dragon Mountain.

144
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,208
We cannot let Kashue
beat us there!

145
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,541
Master Wagnard! Master Wagnard!

146
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,125
It is time for us
to rejoice, my lord!

147
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,583
I have secured the
Soul Crystal Ball!

148
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,291
[WAGNARD]
You've done it, Groder!

149
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,541
Now all that remains
is to return

150
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,916
the Soul Crystal Ball
safely to me.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,083
[GRODER]
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,958
[WAGNARD]
Now you must avoid all risks.

153
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,416
Above all, you must not
fight Shooting Star!

154
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,833
He is the strongest and
most deadly dragon there is.

155
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,958
I doubt even Ashram
can defeat him.

156
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:53,583
In any case, you've done well.
Come back to me at once!

157
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,875
What does he think I am?

158
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,708
After I risk my life to
get the Soul Crystal Ball,

159
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,625
now he will want
to dispose of me?

[knocking]

161
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,875
[MARMO A]
Master Groder,

162
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,916
Sir Ashram needs to
see you immediately.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,791
[GRODER]
Very well. I'll come at once.

164
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,041
Why are you looking at me?

165
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,625
He's changed. Something's wrong.

166
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,166
Then-- Then this
must mean that he's...

167
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,333
Orson, I think you're cured!

168
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,125
You've got your feelings back!

169
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,166
Y-You really think so?

170
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,083
I don't understand why, but--

171
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,250
That look on your face?
And in your eyes?

172
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,833
It's definite; you're cured!

173
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,916
Yes! Now we have to
escape no matter what!

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,916
That's something for our
leader to decide. Right?

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,916
Uh... Yeah!
Let's think of a plan.

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,958
When we go,
we'll all go together!

177
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,291
[SHIRIS]
Right, Leader!

178
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,208
[MAAR] Well, I'm gonna try
to escape on my own!

179
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,000
[snickers]

180
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,541
[NARRATOR] While Orson and
the others plan their escape,

181
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,583
Slayn and Leylia pay a
visit to Captain Genner,

182
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,250
chief of Raiden's
defense forces.

183
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,666
After explaining the situation,
they ask that a rescue party

184
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,125
be sent out to save
their comrades.

185
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,583
I understand your worries,

186
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,333
and I wish there was
something I could do,

187
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,750
but I cannot spare any troops.

188
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,541
I understand.

189
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,375
I suppose we have no choice but
to go after them on our own.

190
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,458
No, dear, we wouldn't
stand a chance

191
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,375
without the proper
fighter support.

192
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,541
Magic alone is not enough.

193
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,208
[door opens]

194
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,375
[PARN] Is someone looking
for fighter support?

195
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,041
[DEEDLIT] I know three
warriors who can help you out.

196
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,916
Parn!

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,458
You know, you should be quieter
when discussing your secrets.

198
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,083
Your voice carries quite a ways.

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,333
[SHIRIS]
Hm?

200
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,500
Is everybody ready?

201
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,333
I'll draw him in,
and you guys jump him.

202
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,208
[door opens]

203
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,125
All right! Got your food here!

204
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,708
[CECIL]
Shiris... Be careful.

205
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,875
It took you long enough!
What kept you?

206
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,958
Shut up! You should be happy
we're feeding you at all.

207
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,458
[MAAR] "Pixies of rest,
spirits of sleep. Send..."

208
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,041
What? What the--?

209
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,000
[MAAR] "And send him
to the land of dreams.

210

Silence, darkness,

211
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,500
[CECIL]
That's-- That's Low Ancient!

212
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,625
[SHIRIS] Don't tell me
he's chanting a spell!

213
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,750
[ORSON]
M-Maar... Ugh...

00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,250

"Oblivion. Peace of mind.

00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,291
Nothing personal, guys.

[MAAR]
Uh-oh! Somebody's coming!

220
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,708
[MAAR]
Oh, Ganeed, god of thieves!

221
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,791
Please let nobody be in here!

222
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,708
[MAAR]
Huh?

223
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,000
[snickers]

224
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,125
[PIRATE A] Help! One of the
prisoners has escaped!

225
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,083
You're too late!

226
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,125
How could you let
them escape?! How?!

227
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,833
Uh, it was just the child.

228
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,375
[ASTAR]
No... It was a grass runner.

229
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,083
Let him go.

230
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,833
What the--?!

231
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,041
[GRODER] The grass runner
wouldn't have stolen it...

232
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,583
...or would he?

233
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:52,625
[roaring]

234
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,333
What's up there?

235
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,291
It looks like a
grass runner, Parn.

236
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,083
[PARN]
What's a grass runner?

237
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,000
[DEEDLIT] Grass runners
are meadow sprites.

238
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,458
They come from the realm
of the plant fairies,

239
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,875
just like elves.

240
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,875
That must be Maar.
He looks like he's all right.

241
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,791
[MAAR]
Ee! Oh no!

242
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,166
I give up.

243
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,250
[DEEDLIT] Thank goodness
everyone's still alive.

244
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,041
[MAAR]
Thanks. It feels better now.

245
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,625
Enough of that!

246
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,625
Now tell me how it can be that
you were the only one to escape.

247
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,583
This is no time to be asking
a question like that.

248
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,541
But we're in luck
since he can guide us

249
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,541
right back to the
pirates' hideout.

250
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:45,291
Huh?! Uh, no way! Those guys are
tough! They're gonna kill me!

251
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
They won't beat us, Maar.

252
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,125
Because we'll be
fighting alongside

253
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,083
the great mercenary king.

254
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,000
King Kashue of Flaim?
Is it true?

255
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,750
[PARN]
It is. So will you be our guide?

256
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,666
Sure. I will.

257
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,833
[PIRATE B]
Enemy attack!

00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,333
Tell me, what are
you Marmo doing?

267
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,750
But I'm not Marmo. I'm just
the captain of the ship.

268
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,958
And besides,
who the hell are you?!

269
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,625
My name, perhaps
you've heard of it.

270
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,041
I'm Kashue Arnegue the Third.

271
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,541
What?! But you're
the king of Flaim!

272
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,458
Something mighty big
must be happening

273
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,166
if you decided to come here!

274
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,708
Talk! Where are Ashram
and the others?

275
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,375
They-- They went to
Fire Dragon Mountain!

276
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,291
That's what he told me.

277
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,083
Are Orson and the
others all right?

278
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,708
[CAPTAIN]
Of course they are!

279
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,291
I wonder what's going on.

280
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,708
Calm down! Orson!

281
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,750
Sorry for the delay, Orson.

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,750
Is everyone all right?

[SHIRIS]
Oh, Parn!

285
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,291
[DEEDLIT grunts]

286
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,500
[PARN]
Shiris! What happened to you?

287
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,916
[SHIRIS] Oh, I'm fine!
It's nothing major.

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,583
What are you doing here?

289
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,250
We were just about to
launch our escape plan.

290
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,833
Just as I figured. But since
we're in such a hurry,

291
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,708
I thought we might
help speed things up.

292
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,291
Yeah? Well, that's okay.

293
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,583
Parn, I don't know
how to thank you!

294
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,833
Orson?

295
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,041
It looks like the power
of the spirit of anger

296
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,958
has grown much weaker in him.

297
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,291
He's got his emotions back.

298
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,000
[CECIL] Maar! How could
you betray us like that?!

299

[MAAR]
I'm sorry!

300
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,000
It was the only thing
I could do at the time!

301
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,541
[SHIRIS]
So, what's next for us?

302
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,166
We head straight for
Fire Dragon Mountain.

303
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,708
Ashram must never be allowed to
get the Scepter of Domination.

304
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,083
I'm going, too!

305
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,750
Are you sure?

306
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,708
It looks to me like you
could use some rest.

307
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,458
I'm definitely going!

308
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
I've got some unfinished
business to settle

309
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,916
with one of them!

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,333
All right.

311
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,250
[CECIL]
I'm coming, too.

312
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,166
I must restore my good name.

313
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,000
And I'm coming along, too!

314
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,833
Very well. You're all
welcome to come.

315
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,958
This way, we can take
care of Ashram

316
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,958
and Shooting Star
at the same time.

Huh?

318
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,291
[PARN]
Wh-What's happened to the sky?!

319
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,625
It's nighttime, but it's
suddenly as bright as day!

320
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,208
Could it be that the whole
city of Raiden is on fire?!

321
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,166
[SLAYN]
Oh, that it were not true...

322
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,833
[DEEDLIT] He said he'd kill
a hundred people

323
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,125
for every scale we scratched.

324
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,000
Shooting Star is
attacking the city!

325
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,541
We must get back
to Raiden right now!

326
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,333
There's nothing we can do.

327
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,250
But-- If we do nothing,
the people of Raiden will--

328
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,125
[KASHUE]
Don't say it, Parn!

329
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,333
Don't you think I'm
aware of that myself?

330
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,083
But putting a stop to Ashram's
ambitions must come first.

331
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,666
It's tough, but sometimes a king
must make the tough decisions.

332
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,708
But they'll--

333
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,333
You know this must hurt
King Kashue as well.

334
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,875
But a king must consider
the lives of all,

335
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,833
not just the lives of a few.

336
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,708
For now, we must concentrate our
efforts on our main objective.

337
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,916
We must put a stop to this,
once and for all.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,833
Very well, Slayn.

339
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42,875
Now we must all go to do our
jobs at Fire Dragon Mountain.

340
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,333
[PARN] We must get the
Scepter of Domination,

341
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,666
and put an end to
Ashram's ambitions forever!

342
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,208
--Welcome...
--...to Lodoss Island!

343
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,750
What you've all
been waiting for...

344
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,666
...the second part!

345
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,375
[giggles]

346
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,416
We wouldn't stand a chance

347
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,083
without the proper
fighter support.

348
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,333
Magic alone is not enough.

349
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,208
[PARN] Did somebody say
they needed fighter support?

350
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,541
Yeah? That's gotta be Parn!

351
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,000
[PARN] Sorry, but I've
become a Shamanist,

352
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,083
so I really can't
support you now!

353
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,916
[giggles]

354
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,875
Now, Orson's got
his emotions back,

355
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,000
so we really must be
getting out of here!

356
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,875
That's what I'd
like to do, but...

357
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,375
Whee! We're on a boat!
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

358
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,375
What's he got to
be happy about?!

359
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,333
Yeah, he's acting
like he's a little kid.

360
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,916
Be careful or you're
gonna hurt yourself!

361
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,250
Ow! It hurts!
It hurts, Shiris! Ow!

362
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,708
There, there. It's all
better now, isn't it?

363
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,958
Ooh, Mama, I want some milk.

364
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,416
[SHIRIS]
Huh?!

365
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,958
No way!

366
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,041
[ORSON]
I didn't think it would work...

367
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,083
[roaring]

368
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:09,541
Oh, no! Raiden is burning up!
We've got to do something! Now!

369
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,291
[KASHUE]
It would do no good.

370
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,041
But if we don't do something,
then Raiden will--

371
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
Please don't say it!

372
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,708
Not in that costume!

373
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,333
[PARN giggles]

374
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,375
[DEEDLIT]
How can you act like that...

375
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,750
...at a time like this?!

376
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,208
[NARRATOR] And so,
Parn and his heroic friends

377
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,541
turn their backs on the
burning city of Raiden.

378
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,375
Are you sure you're doing
the right thing, Parn?

379
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,791
I guess so!

380
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,458
If it means I can dress up
like Shiris the next time!

381
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,625
[ALL groan]

382
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,833
[PARN]
Huh?

383
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,125
[growls]

384
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,375
[giggles]

385
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,500
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

386
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,625
[SHIRIS] A desperate battle
begins at Fire Dragon Mountain

387
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,166
with the Scepter of
Domination as the prize!

388
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,500
Swords clash,

389
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,791
and shamanist magic makes
the earth below tremble.

390
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,083
It is then that Orson sees
the true spirit of anger

391
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,083
that dwells within people.

392
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,625
