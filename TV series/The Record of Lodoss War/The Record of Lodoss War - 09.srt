00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,833
You might even become
a king one day!

163
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,333
So it's only natural!

164
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,625
Come along now, Master Spark.

165
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,291
King Kashue is waiting for you.

166
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
[SPARK]
A king? Become a king?

167
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,125
What is he talking about?

168
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,708
I'm just a knight in training!

169
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,500
And it looks like that's
all I might ever be.

170
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,708
[RUZENAN]
Spark, come along.

171
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,958
[SPARK]
Oh, this is just great!

172
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,750
I thought King Kashue didn't
care about my lineage!

173
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,583
I don't want any
special treatment!

174
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,208
[SPARK] There's no way
a king would invite

175
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,541
a normal trainee to a banquet.

176
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,625
If he's paying attention
to me just because

177
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,416
I'm related to the
chief of my tribe,

178
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,875
well, I'll just tell
him straight out.

179
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,375
I have no intention of
ascending any throne!

180
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:01,000
[GUARD A]
Master Spark, you're here!

181
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,291
I'll announce you at once!

182
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,833
Please, come with me.

183
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,541
I can wait my turn!

184
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,916
Uh, but you--

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,875
Why don't you just do your job?

186
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,916
There's no need for
me to cut the line!

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,291
[MEN murmuring]

188
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,333
[GUARD A gasps]

189
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,375
Please just go along with this.

190
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,333
If Count Ruzenan finds out
that I didn't get you right in,

191
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,916
it'll be my neck!

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,625
[SPARK growls]
Great! I knew this would happen!

193
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,208
[GUARD A]
Announcing... Master Spark!

194
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,375
[SPARK] Knight in training
Spark, reporting, sire.

195
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,500
I hope that you are in
good health, Your Majesty.

196
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,541
Count Ruzenan told me about
the banquet invitation and--

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,166
[SPARK]
But where--

198
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,958
[KASHUE]
Forgive me. I'm over here.

199
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,291
[SPARK]
E-Excuse me, King Kashue!

200
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,833
[chuckles]

201
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,375
I didn't mean to
startle you, Spark.

202
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,541
Come now, you don't
have to kneel down.

203
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,375
Highness? Your Highness,
I have a question to ask.

204
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,541
Was it truly your
wish that I be invited

205
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,125
to this banquet tonight?

206
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,375
For if it wasn't,
then I will not attend.

207
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,083
It most certainly is my wish
that you attend the banquet.

208
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,833
[gasps]

209
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,791
[KASHUE] But that's not
why I summoned you.

210
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,250
I just thought you might like
to see an old friend of yours.

211
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,125
[SPARK]
Huh?

212
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,333
[PARN]
It's been a long time, Spark.

213
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,916
Have you been well?

214
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,875
The free knight! Sir Parn!

215
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,250
I can't believe
it's been ten years.

216
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,541
You sure have grown.

217
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,875
Really, just turn your
back for a moment,

218
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,416
and you humans get so big!

219
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,125
I thought you might enjoy
sparring with your old idol

220
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,875
after the banquet tonight.

221
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,958
That is why I wanted to see you.

222
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,583
Is there a problem with that?

223
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,416
[SPARK gasps]

224
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,250
No sir!

225
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,916
[SPARK]
I can't believe it!

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,875
King Kashue actually remembers
the way I idolized Parn!

227
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,458
That's why he invited
me to the banquet!

228
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,166
And I'm wasting time and energy,

229
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,125
getting all worked
up over nothing.

230
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,208
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time, so.

231
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,666
[SPARK gasps]
E-Excuse me, Your Highness!

232
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,791
May I please ask a question?

233
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,875
[KASHUE]
What is it?

234
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,458
Will you allow me
to join the force

235
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,583
you're sending out
to stop the Marmo?

236
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,625
[KASHUE]
Hm?

237
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,791
[BOTH gasp]

238
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,583
[KASHUE] Is this the will
of your tribe, Spark?

239
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,416
No, this is what I want.

240
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,875
It's not the will of the tribe.

241
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,708
[KASHUE] Then you're being
a bit presumptuous!

242
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,375
Enough! Now leave!

243
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,541
[SPARK gasps]
Yes, sir!

244
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
[KASHUE grunts]
He wants to join the force

245
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,375
I'm sending to quell the Marmo.

246
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:56,916
[KASHUE] He doesn't know it, but
that's why you're here, Parn.

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,958
--[music plays]
--[CROWD chatters]

248
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,291
[SPARK] I'm not surprised
King Kashue's angry with me.

249
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,500
What was I thinking, asking him
a question like that?!

250
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,708
[footsteps]

251
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,708
[ALL gasp]

252
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,458
Welcome to this dreary room,
my friends.

253
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,500
I've been waiting for you, Parn.

254
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,666
It's Slayn!

255
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,791
[DEEDLIT]
You're looking well, Slayn!

256
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,708
Deedlit, your beauty
hasn't changed a bit,

257
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,750
even after all this time.

258
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,958
[giggles] I know you're
a great sorcerer,

259
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,666
but when did you
become a flatterer?

260
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,750
I haven't seen you
since Shooting Star.

261
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
I can't believe
it's been ten years!

262
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,958
Where does the time go,
my friend?

263
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,916
From what I can gather, you two
have been rather busy lately,

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,500
raising a free army and leading
the fight to liberate Kanon.

265
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,708
Can you free them
from Marmo's control?

266
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,708
[PARN]
Mm-hm!

267
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,000
I think the people
in the villages

268
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,541
have finally had enough.

269
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,750
They really want the Marmo out.

270
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,375
One more good push and I think

271
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,250
we'll be able to
liberate Kanon for good.

272
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,458
So I guess you're here to get
some support from Flaim's army.

273
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,291
Am I right?

274
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,416
Why is it that you always
pick the worst time

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,875
to ask for favors?

276
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,000
Duke Raster is that
big of a problem?

277
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
Heh, news travels
fast around here, no?

278
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,166
[SLAYN] As the uprisings
in Alania continue,

279
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,041
it seems certain
that Duke Raster

280
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,458
has formed an alliance
with the Marmo.

281
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:43,333
If by any chance Alania should
fall under control of the Marmo,

282
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,666
they would then have a
much stronger presence

283
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,833
and a larger sphere of
influence throughout Lodoss.

284
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,333
I see. You must attack.

285
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,083
[KASHUE]
I have no choice.

286
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,833
Raster has ignored our warnings,

287
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,916
and now, he's formed an
alliance with the Marmo.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They must be stopped.

289
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,208
A war with Alania...

290
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:07,000
So there is no way for you
to split your forces now.

291
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,458
Stopping Duke Raster
must come first.

292
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,666
But don't worry.

293
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,041
As soon as our campaign
in Alania is over,

294
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,041
the army of Flaim
will assist you.

295
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,541
Thank you, sir.

296
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,708
In the meantime,

297
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,708
the free army will
hold its own in Kanon.

298
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,291
Uh, by the way, sir.

299
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,333
[KASHUE]
Hm?

300
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,083
Are you going to
allow that young man

301
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,416
to go with you into battle?

302
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,833
Oh, you mean Spark.
Are you worried about him?

303
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,250
I am. He seems so hotheaded,

304
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,750
just like a certain young
man we both used to know.

305
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,916
[laughs]

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
Well, that's okay.

307
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,000
We're not going to be taking
our trainees with us this time.

308
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,583
Still, Your Highness,

309
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,166
I think you should give at least
some thought to what he said.

310
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,125
You can't just keep
him in training forever.

311
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,291
[KASHUE]
What are you saying, Parn?

312
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,875
[PARN]
War changes a person,

313
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,958
either for good or for bad.

314
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,833
Don't you think it's about time
he got some real experience?

315
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,083
Perhaps you're right...

316
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,166
But Parn, I don't
want him to become

317
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,291
a man who thinks only about war.

318
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
There is something
special about that one--

319
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,125
something different.

320
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,500
I believe he is essential
for the future of Flaim.

321
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,208
He must be.

322
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,791
[GUARD B] Hey, isn't that
Master Spark over there?

323
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,250
Huh?

324
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,625
Did you want something from
inside the treasure house?

325
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,291
Or have you just had
enough of the banquet?

326
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,708
Uh, no. I just needed
to get a little air.

327
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,333
I take it you two got
stuck pulling guard duty.

328
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,083
Aren't we the lucky ones?

329
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,500
We sure are!

330
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,666
But if a little wine came
our way, I wouldn't mind.

331
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,208
You may make light of this,

332
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,291
but you'll be sorry there's
trouble and you're unprepared!

333
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,041
[GUARD B] What's to worry?
We're perfectly safe.

334
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,833
I heard that Master Slayn
put a protection spell

335
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,041
on the treasure house.

336
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,375
So don't worry about us.

337
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,375
Just go back and enjoy
the banquet, Master Spark.

338
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,666
[SPARK]
Right.

339
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,125
Hey, thanks.
I'm going back inside.

340
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,083
Have a good night.

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,291
Have some fun for us, too, okay?

342
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,166
[GUARD B screams, groans]

343
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,333
[SPARK]
H-Hey!

344
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,500
What happened?!

345
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,875
[groans]

346
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,125
[SPARK]
Huh?

347
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,041
A Dark Elf! Marmo!

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,708
[SPARK] What are the Marmo
doing inside the castle?!

349
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,583
[SPARK]
Welcome...

350
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,708
...to Lodoss Island!

351
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,291
What you've all
been waiting for...

352
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,375
[BOTH]
...the second part!

353
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,625
[giggles]

354
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,458
[PARN]
Hi!

355
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,791
It's Parn!

356
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,666
Spark!

357
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
[laughs]

358
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,708
You've gotten really big!

359
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,125
But you're not
a knight, not yet!

360
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,083
But it's not a big deal, is it?

361
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,208
You'll get your title next year!

362
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,083
He's right! You'll get it
next year, you'll see!

363
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,500
Even this big guy took years
until he became a true knight!

364
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,041
Yeah, but how many years
will I have to wait?

365
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,458
I wanna be one right now!

366
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,750
I wanna be a knight!
I wanna, I wanna...!

367
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,458
You think you could be one?!

368
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,083
[SPARK]
Yeah...

369
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:41,916
Huh?

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,583
You're just a child, Spark.

371
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,416
[SPARK] But I'm not that young.
Please, give me one more chance.

372
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,458
I'm sorry, but I will
not change my mind.

373
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,916
Aw, come on, Your Highness,

374
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,458
don't you remember
how happy I make you?

375
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:54,916
Now!

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,708
[cheers]

377
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:58,750
[PARN]
Huh?

378
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,291
[KASHUE]
Persuasive, isn't he?

379
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,291
Very well. When you
put it that way,

380
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,083
I have no choice.

381
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,541
[SPARK]
It worked!

382
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,333
Now, you must be prepared to
complete all of my tasks.

383
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,583
I am. I'm ready for anything.

384
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,791
Very well!

385
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,958
Now, my dear, sweet,
darling daughter Neese

386
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,416
has baked some cookies.

387
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,333
Will you come with me
to Big Dragon Mountain

388
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,291
so I can give these
to the Mama Dragon?

389
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,250
[grunts]

390
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,666
[SPARK gasps]

391
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,833
[NEESE]
Let's go, Spark!

392
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,250
Eh? Cookies?!

393
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,166
[KASHUE] He can't even handle
a simple little assignment.

394
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,791
Oh, Spark, how you
disappoint me...

395
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,833
If you pass this test, I know
you'll become a great knight!

396
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,166
[GROUP]
Yeah, as if!

397
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,208
Making him the baby sitter
was a perfect idea!

398
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,041
[laughs]

399
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,583
[cries]

400
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,708
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

401
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,583
[SPARK] Standing before me
is a menacing Dark Elf!

402
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:16,333
If I defeat him, the king will
have to accept me as a knight.

403
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,750
As I face him alone,
his black daggers

404
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,875
thrust toward my racing heart!

405
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,666
Next time,
on Record of Lodoss War:

406
