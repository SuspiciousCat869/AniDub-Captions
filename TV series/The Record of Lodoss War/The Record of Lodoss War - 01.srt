[NARRATOR] To the south
of the continent of Alecrast

4
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,541
lies an island known as Lodoss.

5
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,541
Forged in the fierce
battle between Marfa,

6
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,500
the Goddess of Creation,

7
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:47,000
and Kardis, the Goddess
of Destruction,

8
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,958
Lodoss has come to be known
as "The Accursed Island."

9
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,791
And now, in a land whose history
is painted with the hues of war,

10
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,041
new ambitions are stirred.

11
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,416
[NEESE]
Why has a knight of Marmo

12
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
come to this far-off place?

13
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,041
What brings you to this
holy temple of Marfa,

14
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,416
Goddess of the Earth?

15
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,791
You know about that
sword, don't you?

16
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,958
From the very beginning,

17
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,500
it's brought nothing
but suffering.

18
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,708
It was first used by
the king of the demons.

19
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,666
The Soul Crusher
should be locked away

20
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,208
where no one can
ever retrieve it.

21
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,916
I did not come this far

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,708
for a history lesson about
my sword, Priestess!

23
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,125
I have a question for you.

24
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,125
Will you answer me truthfully?

25
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,083
I will not lie, however--

26
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:43,000
Very well. A simple answer will
reveal what I need to know.

27
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,250
I want you to tell me about

28
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,666
the treasure of the
ice dragon, Bramd.

29
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,875
Why do you need to
know about that?

30
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,250
[ASHRAM]
I am a greedy man

31
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,125
who wishes to take Bramd's
treasure for myself.

32
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,583
Long ago, the glorious
kingdom of Sorcery

33
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,791
entrusted the five
ancient dragons

34
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,375
with the Governor's Treasures,

35
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,291
appointing them guardians
for all eternity.

36
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,916
However, the ice dragon
Bramd had no treasure.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,875
But... that means you
must have seen him.

38
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,541
[ASHRAM] Indeed. He gave
us a rather nasty welcome.

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:19,583
However, I'm absolutely certain
the ice dragon regrets that now.

40
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,833
[gasps]

41
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,583
What have you done?!

42
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,708
I can't believe you'd
actually attack and kill

43
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,083
a hibernating dragon,
or would you...?

44
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,666
It's been rumored
you are the one

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,291
who released Bramd
from his terrible curse.

46
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,958
As a reward for his freedom,

47
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,041
he gave you one of his
treasures. Is that so?

48
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,916
I sold off that treasure

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,541
to help pay for the upkeep of
this holy temple of Marfa.

50
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,958
[ASHRAM]
I see.

51
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,166
But any treasure that
could be traded for money

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,458
would be of no use to me.

53
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,583
I apologize for disturbing you.

54
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,875
[NEESE]
Who are you?!

55
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,291
[ASHRAM]
I am Ashram,

56
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,291
loyal servant of
Emperor Beld of Marmo,

57
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,041
the man who united
this accursed island.

58
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,583
And now I have a question
for you, Sir Ashram.

59
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,916
What will you do with
the Governor's Treasures

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,750
when you finally acquire them?

61
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,625
My late emperor's wish
is my only desire,

62
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,500
the meaning of my life;

63
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,166
for that, I must possess
the greatest treasure of all,

64
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,958
The Scepter of Domination!

65

[NEESE gasps]

who were they?

70
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,291
You must summon Leylia
back from Zaxon right away.

71
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,125
Have her bring her husband
and my granddaughter as well.

72
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,875
[NEESE] Again, I must
entrust one so young...

You're holding us up!

Our enemies won't run away...
As much as I wish they would.

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,000
Blood should not
be shed needlessly.

for a mercenary to say!

he's scared of fighting a--

Now look, Orson. We are
going to Zaxon to pick up

82
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,208
some overdue taxes that are
rightly due to Duke Raster.

I doubt we'll have
to fight anyone.

84
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,416
And if we do,
it won't be a big job.

Either they all pay up,
or we'll make them pay up!

You can save the
tough-guy act for the job.

Are we clear on this, Orson?

88
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,958
Duke Raster is giving
us a quarter

of everything we collect!

This is a sweet deal, and I'm
not going to let you blow it.

00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,666
Hah! You're mine!

160
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,416
[CECIL]
Huh? Where'd they go?

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,208
Damn! It's a trap!

162
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,916
[SHIRIS] I didn't think
you'd be stupid enough

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,583
to fall for one this simple.

164
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,875
Guess I was wrong.

165
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,666
What kind of magic
spell is gonna

166
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,750
get you out of
trouble this time?

167
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,125
[growls]

168
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,583
[SHIRIS]
Anyway, you're trapped now,

169
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,000
so why don't you drop that
sorcerer's staff, Mr. Slayn?

170
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,416
Drop it, I said!

171
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,750
Huh? I'm not him.

172
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,708
My name is Cecil,
and I'm the captain

173
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,208
of the village defense
forces while Slayn is away.

174
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,041
Huh? But no one told us
there'd be two of them.

175
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,291
Raster said there'd only be one.

176
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,166
[SHIRIS growls] It doesn't
matter who you are then!

177
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,958
The fact of the matter is that
you are still our hostage!

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,541
Even if you take me hostage,

179
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,958
the village of Zaxon
will never pay taxes

180
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,083
to finance Alanian wars!

181
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,875
Kill me if you want to!

182
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,541
You've sure got guts.
Whatever you wish.

183
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,958
Is it really necessary
to kill him?

184
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,541
I'm sure of it!

185
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,250
There's no way we can let him
get away with humiliating us!

186
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,458
[SHIRIS]
Come on!

187
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,416
If you're going to beg
for mercy, now's the time!

188
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,958
[DEEDLIT] The wind spirit
Sylph is protecting you.

189
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,916
You're safe now, Cecil.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,541
Hey, come back!

191
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,875

The wind spirits?!

195
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,291
But I didn't see
him cast a spell!

196
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,916
The sorcerer didn't do it.
The elf did.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,666
[SHIRIS]
An elf?!

198
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,416
Come now, Cecil. Why are
you still so careless?

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,916
Deedlit!

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458

Cecil! I'll take it from here!

[CECIL]
Parn!

202
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,000
You two can stop this right now!

203
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,583
If you don't,
I'll show no mercy!

204
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,250
[SHIRIS]
Parn... I've heard of you!

205
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,750
Aren't you the famous
free knight?

206
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,666
The great swordsman who
travels with the high elf?

207
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,458
He's good. Don't fight.

208
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,333
You stay out of this!

209
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,333
Hey, Parn! If you really wanna
fight me, you'd better hurry up!

210
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,916
And you guys, watch
for his magical friends!

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,541
Keep 'em back!

Hurry up, Cecil!
He's gonna kill me!

Deedlit, what did you do to him?

222
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,666
I cast a spell of silence,

223
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
hoping that it
might confuse him.

224
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,750
But even when all sound
vanished, he just kept going.

225
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,458
It's strange, but he didn't
seem disturbed by it.

[swords clanking]

There's no way you can beat me.

[SHIRIS]
Okay, okay. I accept it.

233
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,250
You beat me, Mr. Warrior.

234
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,458
Then you agree to
listen to me now?

235
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,041
Well since you've beaten me,

236
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,708
I really don't have
much choice now, do I?

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,875
Of course, you will
have to let me live.

238

That's not much of a condition
for an unconditional surrender.

I'm all right!

Nothing will affect him now.

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,541
I thought there was something
strange about him.

249
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,208
I'm sure now;
he's become a berserker.

A berserker?!

[DEEDLIT] That man is controlled
by the spirit of rage and anger.

The only things he
can feel now are rage

The possession is so strong,

256
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,125
he cannot distinguish
between friend or foe.

257
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,000
He'll keep on killing
until his body falls apart.

258
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,416
I don't believe it!

259
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,125
If a guy like that
got into the village--

Move!

[SHIRIS]
Orson. Orson, snapt out of it.

299
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,916
[SHIRIS]
A long time ago,

300
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,708
Orson watched as
his older sister

301
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,916
was murdered before his eyes.

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,166
Since then, whenever he
sees a woman in danger,

303
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,958
he starts fighting
like a madman.

304
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,291
I know that you can't really
change your destiny.

305
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,333
But if that war hadn't happened,

306
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,916
perhaps Orson would
not be this way today.

307
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,666
Even though the War
of Heroes may be over,

308
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,000
it seems to me, there are
still some places in Lodoss

309
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,291
where its wounds have
not yet been able to heal.

310
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,708
By the way, have you decided
what you're going to do with us?

311
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,708
If you swear to us
that you and your friend

312
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,000
will never bother
our villagers again,

313
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,333
I will allow you to
go free this time.

00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,375
Welcome home, Master!

317
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,208
Is there anyone here who
can tell me what's happened?

318
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,458
Parn, you look a
little worn out.

319
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,916
Of course I am.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,750
I was busy risking
my life for the village,

321
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,833
and, well, it kinda
tires me out!

322
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,625
You don't usually take Leylia
and Little Neese with you

323
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,750
when you go away, Slayn.

324
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,958
Hey, young lady,
where did you all go?

325
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,958
We went to see Big Neese!
She's my grandma!

326
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,625
You went all the way
to Marfa's temple?

327
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,333
Why, yes, that's right.

328
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,541
You see, I received an urgent
communication from Mother.

329
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,541
And I need your help, Parn.

330
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,291
[PARN] Not today,
Slayn. I need a break.

331
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,583
Save it for tomorrow.

332
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,875
Then I'll fight your
dragon or whatever it is.

333
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,083
You mean, you'll really
fight a dragon?

334
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,583
What a relief!

335
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,458
I was worried about what I'd
have to do to convince you,

336
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,958
but not anymore!

337
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,000
You're a lifesaver, Parn!

338
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,541
You did say a dragon,
didn't you?

339
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:49,375
[SLAYN] Yes. For the sake
of Lodoss. And at any cost!

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,416
--Welcome...
--...to Lodoss Island!

341
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,000
What you've all been
waiting for...

342
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,958
...the second part!

343
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,125
[giggles]

344
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,416
[NARRATOR] To the south of
the continent of Alecrast

345
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,833
lies the accursed
island of Lodoss.

346
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,791
It is covered by all
sorts of kingdoms,

347
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,291
both large and small.

348
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,041
[PARN grunting]

349
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,500
Parn is a free knight.

350
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,166
That means he isn't
bound to any kingdom.

351
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,041
[giggles] Right, Parn?

352
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,833
[DEEDLIT] If he swears
loyalty to one kingdom,

353
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,916
he can't help any others.

354
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,458
As a free knight,

355
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,666
you wanna help all people who
live on Lodoss, right, Parn?

356
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,250
[grunting]

357
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,833
Oh my, Parn! Once you set
your mind on something,

358
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:38,541
you don't notice anything else,
do you, Parn?

359
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,583
Well, I guess that's
why I, um... Oh!

360
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,583
Ooh, you love him! [giggles]

361
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,666
[DEEDLIT gasps]

362
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,500
Love! Love...!

363
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,750
Aw, Slayn!

364
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
What's wrong now, Deedlit?

365
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,458
Why did the spirit
of anger appear?

366
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,958
Uh, keep on fighting to build
that wonderful tomorrow, Parn!

367
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,333
Don't give up, Parn!
We're the heroes!

368
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,333
Pow-pow, Parn! Come join in!

369
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,416
[PARN]
Uh...

370
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,583
[BOTH]
Pow-pow, Parn! Pow-pow, Parn!

371
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,083
Go now, Free Knight of Lodoss!

372
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,458
So this is the free knight that
I've heard so much about.

373
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,916
Pow-pow, Parn!

374
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,291
I want you to fight
a terrible dragon

375
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,041
for the sake of Lodoss Island!

376
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,416
He's real tough! So be strong,
oh brave free knight!

377
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,708
Pow-pow, Parn!

378
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,291
Huh?

379
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:35,208
[DEEDLIT, SLAYN, SHIRIS, ORSON]
Pow-pow, Parn! Pow-pow, Parn!

380
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,375
[DEEDLIT]
Parn, you, too!

381
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,458
[PARN]
Me?

382
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,708
[ALL]
Pow-pow, Parn!

383
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,708
But what exactly
does it all mean?

384
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,958
That you'll never know
what'll happen next.

385
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,125
Welcome to Lodoss Island!
Pleased to meet you!

386
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,250
[ALL]
We'll be seeing you!

387
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,666
[PARN] A sudden mission to
become dragon slayers.

388
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,958
Neese, Priestess of
the Earth Goddess Marfa,

389
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,583
has entrusted Slayn
with this responsibility.

390
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,666
Now is the time to reveal
the dark memory

391
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,208
that has been kept
for 500 years!

392
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,583
Next time, on
<i>Record of Lodoss War:</i>

393
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,750
<i>Chronicles of the Heroic Knight:</i>

394
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:29,166

of the Lost History."
