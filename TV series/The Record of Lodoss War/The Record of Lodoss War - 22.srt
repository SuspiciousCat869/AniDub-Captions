[REONA] Fifteen years ago,
Emperor Beld started

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,791
what became known as
"The War of Heroes."

3
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,625
Since then, the Marmo have
controlled my father's kingdom,

4
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:22,416
using it as their
gateway to Lodoss.

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,333
But no more!

6
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,416
Today, our great
dream is at hand!

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,708
We shall retake
our home! Now go!

Hey! Garrack, come on!

00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,375
Our objective is the city

Come on, Priest, move it!

[ASHRAM]
What is it, Groder?

30
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,875
[GRODER] Sir Ashram, the
free army is attacking.

31
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,500
They've penetrated
the city gate.

32
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,125
It has begun...

33
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,791
I never thought the enemy
would attack before

34
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
the reinforcements
from Flaim arrived.

35
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,125
I guess I misjudged them.

36
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,625
Even though they may
have attacked us first,

37
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,916
we still greatly outnumber them.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,500
There's no reason why we can't
fight them hard and beat them.

[ASHRAM]
Hmm.

40
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,583
Gather all of our
troops together.

41
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,875
Defend the city
center at all costs.

[MESSENGER]
Sir!

43
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,166
[ASHRAM] Roodo was Marmo's
first foothold in Kanon;

44
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,000
our main artery into
the rest of Lodoss.

45

they had? Impossible!

then so be it. But I still
have a solemn duty

167
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,291
to find a safe home for
the people of Marmo.

168
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,708
[ASHRAM] There's only
one path left for us.

169
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,625
We shall abandon
this accursed island

170
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,541
and set out on the seas.

171
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,916
The people of Marmo will
have a land of their own.

172
00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:01,250
No, Maar. You are
wrong about Ashram.

173
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,375
He is a true visionary
and a leader.

174
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,291
[PARN growls]

175
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,625
[NARRATOR]
With Ashram's retreat,

176
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,333
the curtain fell on
the battle over Roodo.

177
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,958
Without leadership, the
remaining Marmo soldiers

178
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,166
lost their will to fight.

179
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,083
And with the city of Roodo
finally free of the Marmo,

180
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,916
Prince Reona proudly proclaimed
the rebirth of Kanon...

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,250
...and his rightful
place as its leader.

182
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,625
Uh?

183
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,083
[RYNA giggles]

184
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,083
[SPARK chuckles]

185
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,875
[NARRATOR] That night, King
Kashue and the army of Flaim

186
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,333
arrived at Roodo,

187
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,791
having completed their
long trek from Alania.

188
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,375
The joyous reunion
with Prince Reona

189
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,958
resulted in a new alliance
between the rededicated

190
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:12,375
kingdom of Kanon and the
desert kingdom of Flaim.

191
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,583
Highness! Welcome.

192
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,708
Parn! I'm sorry for the delay.

193
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,958
Defeating Duke Raster took
longer than I had anticipated,

194
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,708
but I've just signed a
treaty with Prince Reona

195
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,375
to join forces for
the sake of Lodoss.

196
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:35,666
I'm glad. But, Your Highness,
what has become of Alania?

197
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,750
[SLAYN] The new king Robess
has assumed full power there.

198
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,000
[PARN]
Slayn! And Laylia, too!

199
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,208
The new king has a whole
new government to set up.

200
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,041
We had to leave Cecil
behind to help him.

201
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,458
Flaim and Kanon...
Alania and Valis...

202
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:56,583
It looks like the great kingdoms
of Lodoss are finally uniting.

203
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:00,250
And the only exception is
the dark island of Marmo.

204
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,583
[BOTH gasping]

205
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,125
But I don't think there's
too much to worry about.

206
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,750
With so many of us
allied against them,

207
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,916
Marmo ambitions will
surely begin to wain.

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,333
I hope you're right,
Your Highness.

209
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,375
[SPARK]
Highness! I must speak with you!

210
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,458
[ALL]
Huh...?

211
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,916
I thought I ordered
you back to Flaim.

212
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,291
[KASHUE] What?! The two
keys and the Doorway

213
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
are now in Wagnard's hands?!

214
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,041
Our daughter...!

215
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,375
[ALDONOVA]
Oh, forgive me, Master!

216
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,333
Even though I was here
with her, she...

217
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,125
She... Oh, Lady Neese!

218
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,125
There was nothing
that you could've done

219
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,875
to prevent this, dear Aldonova.

220
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,458
Even if the circumstances
were different,

221
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,875
she would've wound
up on Marmo anyway.

222
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,625
It is her destiny
as the Doorway.

223
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,458
She could not fight it.

224
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
I'm sorry...

225
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,208
Even though we've got enough
men to go after them,

226
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,791
we haven't got the proper means,

227
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,416
because Ashram took almost
every available ship

228
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
when he ordered
the Marmo retreat.

229
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,583
Well, that means we'll
just have to wait

230
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,625
until reinforcements and ships
arrive from the holy kingdom.

231
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,375
But Highness, that's not
an acceptable option!

232
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,583
[KASHUE]
Hmm?

233
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,791
If the resurrection
ceremony is completed,

234
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,541
then Neese will... If I could
take just a small group with me

235
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:22,208
on one of the remaining ships,
then I swear to you

236
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:27,333
that I will save Neese and stop
the Destroyer's resurrection!

237
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,250
You can count on me to come
along and help you, Spark.

238
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,625
Anyway I can.

239
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Sir Parn...

240
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,250
Heh. Well, I guess it's
been decided, then.

241
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,583
[gasps] Highness...

242
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,833
Here it is. Until we
can plan our invasion,

243
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,875
there's still much to
be done here in Lodoss.

244
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,666
Yours is the only group
prepared for this mission.

245
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,541
Now go, quickly.

246
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,875
[SPARK gasps]

247
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,500
I leave the entire future
of Lodoss in your hands.

248
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,791
[gasps]

249
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
Sir!

250
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,291
[WAGNARD]
Hmm?

251
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,250
[WAGNARD]
Hmph!

252
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,333
I already know that
Roodo has fallen.

253
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,625
Now no one can stop
the tide of time.

254
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,875
So... tell me now, Grey Witch.

255
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,083
Who do you think
will win my game?

256
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,291
I'm still opposed to the
Destroyer's resurrection.

257
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:12,875
Therefore, I alone must
stop the tide of time.

258
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,250
[WAGNARD] You shall only serve
to bury the light of Lodoss

259
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,833
with your own hands. [chuckles]

260
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:24,000
All of you may continue on
with your useless struggles,

261
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,500
but I doubt the power
of the Grey Witch

262
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,375
will be able to
make a difference.

263
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:36,125
[KARLA] Should I fail, you may
do as you like, Wagnard.

264
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,291
The negotiations
are over, Karla.

265
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,666

What do you want?!

It is time.

269
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:16,458
The holy altar to Kardis the
Destroyer awaits the sacrifice.

[SPARK, NEESE]
Welcome to Lodoss Island!

00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,541

all been waiting for,

[LITTLE DRAGON]
Ah-ha!

00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,375
The young and not old free
knight Parn has appeared

277
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,125
once again to help Spark
and Neese prevent

the special cookies from
falling into evil hands!

in a dangerous situation

Elf's deadly trap.

00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,250
[SPARK] We finally made it
to the dark island of Marmo.

324
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,208
As we hurry through
the dark forest,

325
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,291
we are attacked by
demonic creatures,

326
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,416
a trap set by Karla,
the Grey Witch.

327
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,208
But I cannot slow down!

328
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,583
Not until Neese is safe.
