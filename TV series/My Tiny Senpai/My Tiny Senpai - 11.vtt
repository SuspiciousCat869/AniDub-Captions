Uh. Senpai?

[Shiori humming]

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:16.818 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] It's rare for her
to still be here at dinnertime.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.721 position:19% line:89% align:start
âª Meow for Meowtaro! âª

âª Meow, meow, meow! âª

-Huh?
-[SHINOZAKI] Busted.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh... huh...

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.097 position:19% line:83% align:start
-âª Meow for Meowtaro! âª

âª Meow, meow, meow! âª

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.334 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
And she wants me to sing along?

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.871 position:21% line:89% align:start
âª Meow, meow, meow! âª

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.740 position:21% line:89% align:start
Good job, Shinozaki!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.107 position:21% line:89% align:start
That sounded lovely.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.778 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-Another cute abuse of power.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.675 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yuusuke's a thirsty boi.

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:22.677 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.178 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE] Wow, you're working
late on your entry, huh?

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:27.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
Take this. It is for you.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.751 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay. Thank you.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I were you, I'd just
throw something together

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:33.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
and call it a day.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.288 position:19% line:89% align:start
Anyway, I'm going home.

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:37.558 position:10% line:89% align:start
See ya! Don't work too hard!

[sighs]

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.461 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
Throw it together? No!

00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:44.264 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to help the director
aim higher!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, everybody.
How's your morning?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.237 position:41% line:83% align:start
[STAFF]
Uh...

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there something bothering
you guys?

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should be asking you
that question!

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] The competition
deadline is soon.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.047 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is he working too hard?

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not to worry! I'm A-okay!

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.052 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] At least, that's
what I want her to think.

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:06.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
But on the inside,
I'm losing it!

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've never competed directly
against someone at work.

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then there's the pressure
of keeping our manager.

00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:16.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
I could really use a break,

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.965 position:10% line:89% align:start
but I can't tell Senpai that!

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then she would start
stressing out too!

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.904 position:19% line:89% align:start
See, never been better.

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:24.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Work, work, work.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.441 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.510 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Shinozaki.

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:30.878 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:33.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the kanji for person,
remember?

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:36.483 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now go ahead
and scarf it down, okay?

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.587 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, what for?

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:41.089 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can tell that you're worried

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.524 position:19% line:83% align:start
about your presentation
being absolutely perfect.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:46.561 position:16% line:83% align:start
But regardless of the way
it goes in the end,

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.763 position:13% line:83% align:start
you still don't need to be
afraid of failure.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd even say that's what
the contest is about!

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.602 position:33% line:83% align:start
So just swing
as hard as you can!

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you assuming
that I'm gonna miss?

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.107 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[giggles]
-Uh, thank you, Senpai.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.373 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Sure!

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:01.976 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA]
Magnificent!

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
The concept and targeting are
so accessible and well-defined.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
I really appreciate that,
ma'am.

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.783 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just one thing.

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:10.283 position:21% line:89% align:start
You need a nice image

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.753 position:33% line:83% align:start
to illustrate
the complete product

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then this will be
an even easier sell.

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:15.022 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, an image.

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.092 position:21% line:83% align:start
Right, and it can be
as simple as you want.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.563 position:10% line:83% align:start
[smiles] You're almost there,
Kurusu.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.931 position:27% line:89% align:start

Okay.

Hmph.

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Senpai helped me
calm down a bit.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right, it's showtime!

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.013 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-Oh! Excuse me!

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.617 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.354 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.196 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Senpai?
-Huh?

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know that girl Kurusu
from Dev Group One?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, I do know her.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, she's also entering
the new hire competition.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
It kinda seems like

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.843 position:7% line:83% align:start
she's feeling a lot of pressure
like me.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:10.945 position:24% line:89% align:start
So if you see her,

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.815 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would appreciate it
if you would encourage her.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:15.283 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.753 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I understand this is
highly inappropriate.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.722 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just don't think that she
would accept any help from me.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
On top of that, this may be

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:25.960 position:24% line:83% align:start
me seeing a problem
that isn't there.

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:27.360 position:44% line:83% align:start
Uh...
[smiles]

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.763 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, I understand.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll keep that in mind
if I see her then.

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Senpai.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:38.873 position:44% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.575 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You're working late.
-[yelling]

Hello.
You're from Dev Group Two.

Shiori Katase.

00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.787 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you always at the office
this late?

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.523 position:35% line:83% align:start
I don't see
how that's your business.

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:57.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, if you're stuck
on something,

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
a fresh pair of eyes can be
a big help.

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.629 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dev Group Two is the enemy!

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.831 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're done. Please leave.

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:06.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Is it cool if I sit with you?
-It's not!

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.402 position:47% line:83% align:start
Uh.
I know that pouch.

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's twentieth anniversary
Meowtaro merch.

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hah! How were you able
to notice that?

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.678 position:30% line:83% align:start
Because I have
one of those myself.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.948 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know they also released one
that gave him a bowtie.

00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:23.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, I also have that one
in my collection!

00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:25.519 position:27% line:83% align:start
Meowtaro's design
was different back then

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
as he had a rounder head
and smaller eyes,

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.190 position:7% line:83% align:start
and you could tell that his art
was hand drawn

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:30.825 position:10% line:89% align:start
which I think is much cuter!

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.394 position:7% line:89% align:start
I apologize for losing myself.

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:36.931 position:35% line:83% align:start
Even though
it's the Meowtaro company,

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:40.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't get to talk about him
very often.

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:42.003 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Shiori chuckles]

00:06:42.937 --> 00:06:44.872 position:38% line:83% align:start

Um. You may sit with me.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.439 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.177 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, you're
a Meowtaro super fan!

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:53.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should have guessed.
That's why you wanna win, huh?

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:54.615 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh?

00:06:57.818 --> 00:06:59.120 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
May I ask you a question?

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.453 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there any part of your job
that you find difficult?

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:05.359 position:19% line:89% align:start
That you struggle with?

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:07.695 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-Hmm.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
Of course, lots of things!

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:13.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Laying out diagrams,
adjusting text,

the list goes on.

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU] Could you take
a look at this, please?

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:22.209 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.844 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.314 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you say this meow
is taro enough?

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's a leading question
if I've ever heard one!

[KURUSU]
My art skills are subpar,

00:07:31.686 --> 00:07:32.887 position:30% line:89% align:start
as you can see.

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:35.189 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've kept it secret for a year,

00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.825 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I can't do it anymore.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
I would do anything

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
to not cause her
disappointment.

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:45.866 position:10% line:89% align:start
But no matter how often I try

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:47.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
or how much I work,

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.170 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't get any better.

00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:50.638 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:54.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to do well!
I have to! I need to!

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I can't deliver this
for her.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please tell me, what do I do?

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.150 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Well, that's simple.

00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:05.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
Be honest and tell her
that you can't do it.

00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:07.487 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:09.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
But she'll be upset.

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Telling people
what you can or can't do

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
-is part of your job.
-Huh?

00:08:15.763 --> 00:08:16.998 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:20.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did the very best
you could,

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:22.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
so no one is going to hold
anything against you.

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.305 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:25.673 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:29.710 position:35% line:83% align:start
Very well.
I'll try and tell her.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:32.747 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm.

00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:34.215 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[KURUSU] Director.
-Hmm.

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:37.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
I finished my task.
I tried my best.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.621 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please take a look.

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.057 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'd love to.
I can do it right now.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:45.526 position:33% line:83% align:start
Knowing you,
I'm sure it's perfect.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.294 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.230 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA]
You did this?

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:51.399 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
I'm so sorry, Director.

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:53.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[crying]
I did my best,

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:57.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
but that's all I can do.

00:08:58.507 --> 00:08:59.807 position:38% line:89% align:start
Director,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.609 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know that you said I could,
but I can't.

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.545 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wanted to, but I just failed.

00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:06.847 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.684 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA]
You did no such thing.

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.987 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was the one who failed you.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:15.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry, Kurusu.

00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:16.891 position:38% line:83% align:start
I thought
I was encouraging you,

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.993 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I was just adding
to the pressure.

00:09:19.827 --> 00:09:21.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can you ever forgive me?

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:23.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:27.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] Hanaoka,
could you help Kurusu

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.369 position:24% line:89% align:start
with her proposal?

00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:30.037 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HANAOKA]
I'm on it.

00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:31.205 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:32.873 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's no problem at all.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] There are
only a few days left

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:36.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
before the deadline!
Let's all come together

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:39.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
and support Kurusu
as best we can!

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:40.981 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.150 position:21% line:89% align:start
Isn't that touching?

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.919 position:13% line:89% align:start
They really came together.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:46.253 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:49.156 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kurusu laughing]

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.125 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She's in good hands.

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.996 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Even though he's
under just as much pressure,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.766 position:10% line:83% align:start
he's still doing what he can
to help others.

[giggles]

-[chuchkes]
-Oh.

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
Was I making a weird face
or something, Senpai?

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:06.841 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not that.

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was admiring my kohai,
that's all.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.845 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait!

00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:12.780 position:33% line:83% align:start
What did I do
that was admirable?

00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:15.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
-âª Meow for Meowtaro!
-Meow for Meowtaro! âª

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Meow, meow, meow!
-Meow, meow, meow!

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:21.689 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
Thank you for waiting patiently

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:23.657 position:7% line:89% align:start
for My Tiny Meowtaro to return.

00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.326 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
That's not the title.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.429 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Today's the big day, Shinozaki.

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:31.398 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you have everything you need
for your presentation?

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yep! I'm all set.

00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:35.836 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you double
and triple-check to be sure?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.339 position:16% line:83% align:start
I triple, triple-checked,
and I'm good to go!

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:39.673 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:41.610 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
And now we wait.

00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:44.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
I gotta say, that
Meowtaro costume looks spot-on!

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're like a goddess,
Hayakawa!

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:48.182 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's not that big a deal.

00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:50.284 position:35% line:83% align:start
Compared to
my usual cosplay stuff,

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.485 position:24% line:89% align:start
it was pretty easy.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.820 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Just bulkier.
-Your usual what?

00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:55.422 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, cosplay?
No, I don't do that.

00:10:55.557 --> 00:10:56.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
That'd be weird.
[laughs]

00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:58.125 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, my.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.393 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
I could've done this

00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:00.562 position:16% line:89% align:start
without all of your help.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.795 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, thank you, Senpai.

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.164 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Don't say that.

00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:05.766 position:41% line:89% align:start
Senpai?

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is it just me, or are you
more nervous than I am?

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.238 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the biggest moment
of my diligent kohai's career!

00:11:11.506 --> 00:11:13.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm doing everything I can
just to keep it together!

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's like someone
put a whole butterfly garden

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.378 position:30% line:89% align:start
in my stomach.

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:19.380 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It'll be okay, Senpai.
-[SENPAI] I don't know

00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:20.447 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[SENPAI] what I'm gonna do.
-Try taking some deep breaths.

00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:22.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh. huh?

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:23.951 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kurusu.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:25.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
I thought you should know

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:29.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
the one presenting before you
will be me.

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:31.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then I guess we'll be having

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:33.827 position:21% line:83% align:start
something of a final
showdown, won't we?

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I wish you
the best of luck out there.

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.232 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
And another thing.

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.134 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the help.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:41.570 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:43.605 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
Katase mentioned that

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
you had been concerned
about my emotional well-being.

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:48.776 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah-ha.

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:52.213 position:19% line:89% align:start
As such, I'm grateful.

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:55.282 position:47% line:83% align:start
Uh.
Sure thing!

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.284 position:33% line:89% align:start
But still...

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.853 position:7% line:89% align:start
Group One is going to win this.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
Say goodbye to your manager!

00:12:02.957 --> 00:12:05.125 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dev Group Two won't be
losing anything today

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:08.530 position:7% line:83% align:start
and our manager will be staying
with us where he belongs.

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:09.997 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:14.435 position:35% line:83% align:start
We'll see.
Good luck to you.

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:19.039 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah! Time to bring it home!

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:23.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why would we need to say
goodbye to the manager?

00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:25.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
Seems kinda odd,
don't you think?

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:29.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
Aah! Well, sure.
But um, you see.

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:32.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I'm listening.

00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:34.021 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Aah!

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:36.757 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Shinozaki!

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:38.526 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:41.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
Report, contact, and consult!

00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:44.064 position:24% line:83% align:start
Three simple things
and you can't do even one!

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm so very sorry, Senpai.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.636 position:7% line:89% align:start
I knew about the wager though.

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:48.936 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, me too.

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:50.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why am I the only one
who didn't know?

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:52.072 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad!

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:54.008 position:10% line:89% align:start
We have to renegotiate this!

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.076 position:33% line:83% align:start
Except Kurusu
is probably well into her

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.712 position:21% line:89% align:start
presentation already.

For this competition,
the goal of Dev Group Two

was to find new ways
of spreading fun.

It hit me when we were playing
with that preschool class.

There are endless ways
to have fun.

whose purpose

was to help people
share that fun?

of the things you heard

the kids say were fun for them?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was one who said
they enjoyed skateboarding.

Those are perfect!

00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:08.375 position:16% line:83% align:start
Meowtaro could recommend
those kinds of things

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.078 position:19% line:83% align:start
and could even show you
how you can do them yourself.

00:18:42.624 --> 00:18:44.191 position:10% line:89% align:start
but even then, I couldn't win

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:47.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Most Valuable
New Hire award. [crying]

00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:50.197 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] You've done
nothing to apologize for.

00:18:50.665 --> 00:18:51.833 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:54.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on your
excellence award, Kurusu.

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.004 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[crying]
-Huh?

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU] But now you won't
get Dev Group One's manager.

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:02.476 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you said that you needed
him to help you keep growing.

00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:03.945 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:06.814 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know,
I forgot we were doing that.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.784 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was your plan! You forgot?

00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:11.151 position:38% line:89% align:start
Guess so.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.654 position:30% line:89% align:start
But it's fine.

00:19:13.087 --> 00:19:16.156 position:10% line:83% align:start
Seeing you all band together
helped me realize

00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:18.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
I already have everything
I need

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
to reach greater heights.

00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:24.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that's my invaluable
subordinates!

00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:25.833 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm?
You mean it?

00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:29.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
Here's to many more years
together, Kurusu.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.572 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am!

00:19:32.006 --> 00:19:33.107 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all smiling]

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:35.610 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
And now, at long last,

00:19:35.743 --> 00:19:37.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Most Valuable
New Hire!

00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:39.547 position:35% line:83% align:start
There were
many great submissions,

00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:43.117 position:10% line:83% align:start
but only one team was worthy
of this prestigious prize.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.286 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yamagishi and Public Relations!

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.588 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hah!
-Hah!

00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:49.924 position:27% line:89% align:start
But how? Why me?

00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:51.358 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huzzah!

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:53.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE MC 11A] How did you
come up with your idea?

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:55.697 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just kinda did it?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.398 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's all thanks
to my daily, expert guidance!

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:01.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] He was the least
motivated out of anyone!

00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:04.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
This is frustrating.

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.542 position:10% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE MC 11A] On that note,
thanks to all our new hires

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:09.443 position:7% line:89% align:start
for their hard work this year!

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:11.879 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Great job, everyone.

00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:13.514 position:13% line:89% align:start
Especially you, Shinozaki!

00:20:13.648 --> 00:20:15.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] I hear there's a
big wrap party waiting for us!

00:20:16.117 --> 00:20:18.351 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIYAMA]
It's my ultimate victory party!

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:20.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[ALL] No, it isn't.
-[ISHIYAMA] Pretty please?

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:52.814 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yawning]

00:21:52.947 --> 00:21:55.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
Afternoons at work
drag on forever.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.084 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
You heard right.

00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:58.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just the excellence one.

00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:01.856 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, stop!
It ain't nothing like that,

00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:02.990 position:30% line:89% align:start
dontchaya hear?

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.193 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:07.995 position:44% line:83% align:start
Aah!
Catchya later!

00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:11.732 position:24% line:89% align:start
Forget everything.

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:14.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I don't think
it works like that.

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:16.103 position:21% line:89% align:start
Not like that either!

00:22:16.904 --> 00:22:19.339 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, what's the big deal,
anyway?

00:22:19.607 --> 00:22:22.009 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's embarrassing, that's why.

00:22:22.143 --> 00:22:23.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
I don't see how it would be.

00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:27.315 position:7% line:83% align:start
We don't really have an accent
back where I'm from,

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:30.151 position:33% line:83% align:start
so honestly,
I'm a little jealous of yours.

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:31.519 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:22:31.752 --> 00:22:33.588 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU] Hmm. But why would
you be jealous?

00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:35.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, because accents
are awesome.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.390 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:39.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I don't want to
talk through lunch

00:22:39.927 --> 00:22:40.962 position:27% line:89% align:start
so see ya later.

00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.563 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey! Wait up!

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.065 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:47.034 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're a real peach.

00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:49.436 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:22:50.037 --> 00:22:51.371 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm a real what now?

00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:52.540 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph!

00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:55.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
