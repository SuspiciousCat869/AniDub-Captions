00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:12.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I can't believe
it's already December.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.082 position:33% line:83% align:start
It feels like
it was just Halloween.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.283 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.988 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then again, December means
that Christmas time

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.355 position:13% line:89% align:start
is right around the corner!

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
And Christmas means gifts!

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:25.125 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's still a ways away.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
And let's not forget
the office party!

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.899 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can be in charge of getting
drinks and a cake for us.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] She really loves
all the holidays.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.470 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you doing this year?

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:39.106 position:27% line:83% align:start
Got special plans
for Christmas Day?

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:41.441 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not as of yet.

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:44.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since it falls on a weekday,
I think I'll just work.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.613 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's fair.

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.314 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It sucks I don't have plans,

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
but if I come into work,
I'll get to see Senpai

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
and that'll be worth it.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ho-Ho-Ho.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since my kohai is going to be
working on Christmas Day,

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.662 position:10% line:83% align:start
Santa Senpai will have to do
something special just for him.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
Be sure to stay off
the naughty list until then!

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:07.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ho-Ho-Ho. Ho-Ho-Ho.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:12.272 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh. Oh, my gosh,
why did I just do that?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.043 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, it's fine.
Don't be embarrassed.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I think her cuteness
stopped time for a second.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.614 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I'm so flustered

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just want to crawl
into a hole.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.383 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:25.019 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
No, it really wasn't that bad.

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:26.453 position:41% line:89% align:start
Honest!

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:27.822 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, Santa Hayakawa?

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:33.193 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stop right there.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, I think we've covered
everything in the proposal.

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're looking forward
to collaborating with you.

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:13.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you have any questions,
we'd love to answer them.

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:15.863 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, you did a great job
explaining everything.

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.497 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks for your hard work.

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.301 position:7% line:83% align:start
Perfect. My associate Shinozaki
will be your point of contact

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
in regards to nailing down
a schedule

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.505 position:21% line:83% align:start
and he'll be in touch
with you soon.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.841 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes! I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.976 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MAN 1] And I look forward
to hearing from you.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.779 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] [sighs]
I thought

00:03:31.913 --> 00:03:34.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd be more used to meeting
with clients by now.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, cut yourself some slack.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.886 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a totally different
experience meeting a client

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.121 position:24% line:89% align:start
on their home turf.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.556 position:13% line:89% align:start
But you'll get used to it.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.924 position:10% line:89% align:start
With how well you did today,

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:44.926 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think it'll happen
for you real soon.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.928 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Wow. Thank you, Senpai.

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:52.232 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Ah!
Are you seeing this, Shinozaki?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're adorable.
Even for loungewear.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:59.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're right, they are cute.
Especially that bunny one.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.143 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Your bunny senpai
wants to know

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
how hoppy you are to see her!

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:05.913 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.348 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She'd be almost be too cute

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:10.151 position:16% line:89% align:start
to handle in that outfit!

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:12.452 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You'd look great in that one.

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:14.021 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so too?

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:17.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Wait, what?
What makes you think that?

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.526 position:13% line:89% align:start
You mean you don't see it?

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.394 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised you didn't
recognize that hoodie.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's almost exactly like the one
on the stuffed dog

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
we won at the arcade.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:27.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:29.203 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ah!

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:33.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why am I trying to make them
look even more alike?

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
By that logic,

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.578 position:10% line:83% align:start
you should look just as great
in that bunny loungewear.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:40.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh! Because of Shiori the kitty?

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:44.185 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.586 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Got you!

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.789 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Ah! Buck buck-kaw.

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:50.825 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Aah! Nope, I don't see it.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
In fact, that sounds like
a terrible idea!

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:53.961 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Why's that?

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because I refuse
to be a perverted Senpai!

00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:57.965 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Where did that come from?

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] It's just,
I'm not sure how comfortable

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'd be wearing that.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:03.571 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah, same.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI, SHINOZAKI]
Then again.

00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:08.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] If Senpai
was comfortable with it.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.979 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
If Shinozaki wore it just once.

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:15.016 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
It'd be the cutest thing ever.

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:17.417 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.587 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.723 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
I really wanna see that!

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:25.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE REPORTER]
Excuse me!

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have some questions
for the lovely couple!

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:29.429 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:30.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE REPORTER]
I bet you're wondering,

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
"Why is this lady yelling
at me?"

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
and let me assure you
I have a good reason.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.770 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm a NyaTuber

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm interviewing
local couples for my channel.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.641 position:38% line:83% align:start
So, yeah,
got any stories to share?

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:41.976 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:45.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] The thing is
we're not actually a couple.

00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:49.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have literally been
at this all day long,

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I still have yet to do
a single interview.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why is it impossible
to find a couple in this town?

00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.258 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I don't know, but I'm sure

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.926 position:13% line:89% align:start
you'll find one eventually.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could've sworn that
you two were a couple though!

00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:03.331 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you aren't dating,

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
then what exactly
is going on between you?

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.535 position:13% line:89% align:start
We work at the same office.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:09.436 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing more than that?

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.439 position:35% line:83% align:start
'Fraid so.
Sorry, we couldn't help.

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:14.242 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hmm! Okay,

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
then would either of you care
to confess your feelings

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
to the other right here and now?

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:18.946 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
No, thank you!

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.282 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, please,
please start dating!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll be your best friend!

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.018 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, would you please
let go of me?

00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:25.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not until one of you
confesses their love

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.321 position:10% line:89% align:start
and starts dating the other!

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:29.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't take another minute
wandering this loveless desert!

00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:31.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I'm very sorry,
but we can't do that.

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:33.060 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[female reporter crying]
-Now please let me go.

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] You're giving people
the wrong idea.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you.

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:38.766 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have barely any subscribers
and get very few views

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.835 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it's not like
anyone's gonna see it.

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.170 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I'm surprised you'd admit that.

00:06:43.304 --> 00:06:44.505 position:30% line:89% align:start
[clear throat]

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:46.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you need a couple that badly,

00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:48.509 position:7% line:83% align:start
then I guess we have no choice
but to help.

00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:50.477 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-Wait, Senpai?

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
Obviously, we would only pretend
to be dating.

00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's totally fine!

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:55.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not like the camera
can tell the difference.

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:57.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Can I do this?

00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:59.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
-...saved my life!
-Pretend to date her?

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.790 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CAMERAMAN] Okay, we are
framed up and ready to go.

00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:04.725 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's amazing

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:06.727 position:27% line:83% align:start
how she can take
such a mature approach to this.

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.163 position:35% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile,
I'm barely holding it together.

00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] She clearly
wasn't going to be giving up

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.201 position:33% line:89% align:start
anytime soon

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
so I figured leaning into it
would be the best solution.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
Except I have no idea
what couples are supposed to do!

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:24.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hm. Would it be better to think
of myself

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:27.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
as Shinozaki's girlfriend
or him as my boyfriend?

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.817 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do couples think about who
they are to their partners

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
or who their partners
are to them?

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.588 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's get this started!

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:36.857 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our first question
is for the girlfriend.

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:38.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, great!

00:07:38.426 --> 00:07:41.262 position:13% line:83% align:start
What is your favorite thing
about your man? [chuckles]

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:42.897 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's my favorite thing?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:47.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is going to be embarrassing
but I have to commit.

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:49.870 position:21% line:89% align:start
If I had to pick one,

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:53.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
it would be how he gives 110%
to all of his tasks.

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:54.275 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:56.043 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE REPORTER]
That is adorable!

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:58.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
I assume you two met
on the job then?

00:07:58.512 --> 00:07:59.947 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
Got to know each other
while working hard side by side?

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.884 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yup, right again.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] This is a lot easier
than I thought.

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:09.423 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay. On to the next question.

00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:11.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, where did you
have your first kiss

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:12.593 position:21% line:89% align:start
and what was it like?

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:14.895 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is not what
I signed up for!

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can't jump straight
from work to first kisses!

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:19.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh? Do you think so?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
Plus, we're only pretending
to be a couple

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:24.505 position:7% line:83% align:start
and asking questions like that
will give it away.

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.007 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then make something up.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.576 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just tell me what you wish
your first kiss

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:29.744 position:10% line:89% align:start
with your coworker was like.

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:32.646 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Oh, no!
-Come on, think about it.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.915 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, if we're making things up.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.317 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.119 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was at the office.

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:40.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
We were alone together
in the kitchenette.

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.456 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Not the kitchenette!

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.493 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now I'll never be able to keep
cool next to the office fridge!

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.328 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Oh, no, why did I say that?

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:50.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
It almost sounds like
I've fantasized about it!

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:52.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
My next question
is for the boyfriend here.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.201 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-Ah!

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I have to agree
to Senpai's premise

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:57.004 position:24% line:89% align:start
and then add to it!

00:08:57.138 --> 00:08:58.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
But given my lack of experience

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.541 position:10% line:83% align:start
and being very uncomfortable
right now,

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's a good chance
I'll slip up.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
What am I gonna do?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.481 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah! I got it!

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
We just had a seminar
about this.

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.585 position:10% line:83% align:start
When you need to be flexible
in your thinking,

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.421 position:7% line:89% align:start
you pretend to be someone else!

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:14.989 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll play the playboy!

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.458 position:24% line:83% align:start
By pretending to be
a lady-killer instead of myself,

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to respond
to anything she throws at me

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.295 position:16% line:89% align:start
without breaking a sweat!

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:24.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, my life is a series
of meaningless flings!

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:27.768 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, what's your favorite thing
about your sweet little lady?

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.938 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let me think,
I've had so many squeezes

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:32.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
it's hard to keep track of them.

00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:35.276 position:13% line:89% align:start
Um, who are you right now?

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.512 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think the best thing
about this one is

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:40.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
that she hooked up with me
in the first place.

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.083 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know what I mean?

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Where'd you come from,
Shinozaki's hand?

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.653 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:47.288 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.323 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's a total animal
when it comes to efficiency.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
This goddess showed me
there's something way sweeter

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.694 position:19% line:89% align:start
than a fat OT paycheck.

00:09:53.828 --> 00:09:56.430 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ah! I'm in his arms!

00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:57.898 position:19% line:89% align:start
But then, this would be

00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:01.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
what being Shinozaki's
girlfriend would be like.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.037 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wow that's so interesting.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.539 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, where was your first time
together?

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:05.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me?

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:08.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
At my place. Her second visit.

00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:11.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Uh! My second visit?

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:13.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] The first time
is probably too much,

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.715 position:24% line:89% align:start
even for a playboy.

00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:16.317 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Wait a second,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.986 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been to Shinozaki's place
once before in real life.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.057 position:7% line:83% align:start
So then, what's going to happen
the next time I go there?

00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.461 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Shinozaki. You forgot
something back at the office.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Here again?
You know what that means.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:31.866 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:34.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope you're ready then,
Senpai.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:36.437 position:21% line:89% align:start
To do what, exactly?

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.073 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
No! That is still way too soon

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:41.842 position:7% line:89% align:start
for anything along those lines!

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hm! If Shinozaki can say
such shameless things

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.815 position:24% line:89% align:start
without hesitation,

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:50.217 position:10% line:83% align:start
then he's clearly not the man
I thought he was.

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:52.186 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both sigh]

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.088 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ah!

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.356 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:58.560 position:13% line:89% align:start
If I had to pick one thing,

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:02.363 position:10% line:83% align:start
it would be how he gives 110%
to all of his tasks.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.499 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh! I'm so silly.

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:08.702 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's doing such a good job
he nearly fooled me too.

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:11.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
But he's just doing
what he always does

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:13.207 position:16% line:83% align:start
and giving it everything
he's got.

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
You truly are something special.

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:18.479 position:35% line:83% align:start
And a kohai
that I can be proud of.

00:11:18.613 --> 00:11:19.914 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:22.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now let's wrap this up
with a kiss!

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:23.450 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:27.354 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah. Sure. I will kiss her
as I have done before.

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.624 position:33% line:83% align:start
What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:32.326 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I've got to give it my all too.

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:33.528 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

âª

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:41.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] As his senpai, I've got
to support him in any way I can.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Shinozaki.

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:47.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

00:11:48.543 --> 00:11:50.311 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you guys get everything
you needed?

00:11:53.682 --> 00:11:57.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm like, forever grateful
to you both. You have no idea.

00:11:57.351 --> 00:11:58.886 position:41% line:83% align:start
-[sobs]
-[CAMERAMAN] I don't get it.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
How are those two
not already a couple?

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:11.165 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh! Now,
time to take a quick break.

00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:15.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll scroll for a bit
and see what pops up.

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh! This can't be real!

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:25.279 position:21% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] They said

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
they didn't have a lot
of subscribers.

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:28.583 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] They said
they don't get many views,

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:30.084 position:19% line:89% align:start
so no one would see it.

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:32.419 position:41% line:83% align:start

You know I saw your video!

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:37.559 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, why didn't you two tell me
that you were dating?

00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:39.326 position:27% line:83% align:start
-'Cuz we're not!
-'Cuz we're not!

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.762 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Here's a hot coffee
and a warm senpai

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.197 position:10% line:89% align:start
to make you nice and toasty.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.432 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Wow, that's kind of you.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] And we're back
with more My Tiny Senpai.

00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:54.576 position:21% line:89% align:start
Everyone! Listen up!

00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:57.311 position:7% line:83% align:start
I appreciate all your hard work
this year.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, I want you to drink up
and enjoy yourselves.

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:02.116 position:13% line:89% align:start
It is Christmas after all!

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:05.720 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, let's drink to our success,
to the future,

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.022 position:19% line:89% align:start
and Santa's generosity!

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.124 position:27% line:89% align:start
Merry Christmas!

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:11.492 position:41% line:89% align:start
Cheers!

00:13:11.626 --> 00:13:12.826 position:44% line:83% align:start

[AKINA]
Shinozaki, you're so Shinozaki.

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:19.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
That can't be true.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:21.035 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ah, you got me!

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:25.339 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:27.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] Senpai!
-Huh?

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you calling it a night?
I'm going home too.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you want to walk
to the station together?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.816 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh! That sounds great.

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:38.152 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:13:40.555 --> 00:13:42.624 position:13% line:83% align:start
The party was a lot of fun,
wasn't it?

00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:46.894 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and the food they had
was incredible too! And Santa!

00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:49.631 position:30% line:83% align:start
Merry Christmas
to all the boys and girls.

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:52.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was surprised that
he had the complete costume.

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:54.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think he had the most fun out
of everybody there.

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:57.772 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Next year Senpai could be Santa.

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:01.842 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Merry Christmas! [giggles]

00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:03.712 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Glorious.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:05.045 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Looks like the whole city

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:07.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
is in the Christmas spirit, huh?

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.482 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.951 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you have any more big plans
for the evening?

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:13.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not really, no.

00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:16.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well then, since
it's a very special occasion,

00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.426 position:21% line:83% align:start
shall we go somewhere
before we head home?

00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:21.563 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:24.231 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Do you think
I can pull this off?

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:27.569 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:29.637 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Oh, let's head over there next!

00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:30.938 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Sure!

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:32.072 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
So, soothing.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.440 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
And so cute.

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:37.378 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:39.748 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.949 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
It's like a sea of stars.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.520 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been meaning to come here
for a while.

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:46.920 position:13% line:89% align:start
This tree's pretty famous,

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:48.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I've been wanting
to come and see it

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:51.091 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I hadn't had the chance
until tonight.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.794 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:57.498 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm glad that I got to see
it with someone, aren't you?

00:14:57.632 --> 00:14:58.700 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
[chuckles softly] For sure.

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:05.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm also glad that I was able
to spend Christmas with someone.

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.307 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now it's special.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:09.511 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:10.712 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.680 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why do I keep saying words?

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:14.248 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey. Random question,

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:16.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
but where do you suppose
Santa Claus is at the moment?

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:18.085 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, without knowing

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:19.554 position:30% line:83% align:start
which direction
he left the North Pole,

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.422 position:19% line:83% align:start
he could be pretty much
anywhere.

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.157 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I guess so.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.225 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey Shinozaki,
when you were a kid,

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:27.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
did you ever send
a Christmas list to Santa

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
to see what presents
he'd bring you?

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.832 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't think so.

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:32.433 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, wait, yeah.

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:35.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was this one year
that I asked for a game console.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:38.071 position:21% line:83% align:start
Except it turned out
that I got the wrong one.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:39.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
But since it was from Santa,

00:15:39.774 --> 00:15:42.342 position:19% line:83% align:start
I decided to try it out
and I ended up liking it.

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:43.611 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
It never turned into a favorite
or anything,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.247 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I had a lot of fun with it.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.149 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:50.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think my favorite part
of that story was

00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:52.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
hearing how you've always
been a sweetheart.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.488 position:10% line:89% align:start
I guess that's a compliment?

00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:57.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you remember any of the gifts
you got from Santa?

00:15:57.725 --> 00:15:59.359 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I'll have to think about that.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.963 position:10% line:83% align:start
There was one year when I got
this adorable stuffed cat.

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:06.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
I loved it so much I wanted
to have it with me all the time.

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:09.169 position:7% line:83% align:start
I even brought it along with me
to kindergarten.

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:11.739 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which apparently,
I wasn't supposed to do.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.407 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:15.242 position:16% line:83% align:start
That doesn't surprise me
in the slightest.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.945 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can see you doing that now.

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:18.245 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:19.681 position:35% line:83% align:start
Even though
we've grown up a lot,

00:16:19.814 --> 00:16:21.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess deep down
we're still the same people

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:22.517 position:21% line:89% align:start
we always were, huh?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.718 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:25.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.323 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sneezes, groans]

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:31.325 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I had known
I'd be outside this late,

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.727 position:10% line:89% align:start
I would have dressed warmer.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.330 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Oh, no! Her hands must be ice!

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:39.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should subtly guide
her hands into my pockets,

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:40.835 position:16% line:89% align:start
so she can warm them up?

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I'm so warm now.
Thanks, Kohai!

00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:46.473 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
No,

00:16:46.608 --> 00:16:48.743 position:7% line:83% align:start
I should ask her first to avoid
any potential misunderstandings.

00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:50.745 position:24% line:89% align:start
Um. Listen, Senpai.

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.179 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hmm!

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:53.581 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She had gloves the whole time!

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:56.049 position:47% line:83% align:start
Hm?
What, is something the matter?

00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:57.317 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.387 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, it's okay. Just forget it.

00:17:00.522 --> 00:17:03.223 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, Shinozaki,
your hands look super cold.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:04.826 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you not have any gloves?

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:07.027 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
No, but my jacket is warm enough

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
that I should be fine with
just my hands in my pockets.

00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:10.732 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Not good enough.

00:17:10.865 --> 00:17:13.433 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hold on, I'm sure
I have some extras on me.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.069 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I should have seen this coming.

00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:17.939 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:19.507 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:21.275 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll bring you some gloves
in your size next year!

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, I'll be all right.
I needed to get a new pair

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
for myself anyway.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.148 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] We've moved into
"next year promises" territory!

with how sweet the vibes are.

00:17:31.184 --> 00:17:33.021 position:35% line:83% align:start
I told you
it was gonna be like this.

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.221 position:41% line:83% align:start

There really are "couples

-[SHIORI] Ah!

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.969 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
We should head to the station.

[SHIORI]
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:54.274 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh! But before I forget, here.

[SHINOZAKI]
Hey, it's the loungewear!

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I was shopping
for gifts this year,

00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:00.480 position:10% line:83% align:start
I remembered we both thought
that they looked comfy.

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:03.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
Plus, now I know
you'll have a cozy Christmas.

00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:05.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've gotta watch out
for my kohai.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.888 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow, thank you.

00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:10.123 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's so nice of you!
You know, it's funny.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.126 position:10% line:89% align:start
I got the bunny one for you.

00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.431 position:21% line:89% align:start
I love it, thank you!

00:18:17.832 --> 00:18:20.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seems like we were really
in sync this year.

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:21.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.871 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, something about that
makes me very happy to hear.

00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:27.508 position:10% line:83% align:start
Me too. I remembered thinking
you might look good wearing it

00:18:27.642 --> 00:18:30.044 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I kinda wanted to see
that happen.

00:18:30.177 --> 00:18:31.546 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:36.551 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I think it's time to head
in a homewardly direction.

00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:38.853 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you want to.

00:18:38.987 --> 00:18:40.387 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:44.892 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you want to,
then we could show each other.

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:48.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean, you want to... see me?

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.364 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:52.967 position:41% line:89% align:start

Ah!

Curse the soul
who invented the flash!

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:02.977 position:27% line:89% align:start
Curse you I say!

00:19:03.111 --> 00:19:04.612 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:19:04.746 --> 00:19:07.147 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hey!
-What are you doing over there?

00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:09.349 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oh my gosh,
have you been watching us

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:10.652 position:16% line:89% align:start
since we left the party?

00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:13.721 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, we were.
Sorry, about that.

00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:15.355 position:35% line:83% align:start
But you two
were so sweet together

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:16.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
we had to see how it ended.

00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:19.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
I gotta say, Katase,
it turns out you're a lot bolder

00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:22.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
than I gave you credit for.
Good on you.

00:19:22.597 --> 00:19:23.564 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:25.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on. I mean,
you were just talking

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:28.536 position:19% line:83% align:start
about modeling your new
loungewear for each other.

[gasps]

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:33.875 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, I didn't mean it like that!

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:36.044 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was thinking
that we could send pictures.

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wearing the loungewear I mean!

00:19:37.712 --> 00:19:40.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you know that would mean
that we would... Um.

00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:43.718 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'd trade numbers.

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:46.654 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you were okay with that.
I mean.

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:48.523 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all sigh]

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:53.360 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes! I am okay with giving you
my contact information.

00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:55.362 position:10% line:89% align:start
Right. Are you ready for it?

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:56.864 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:19:56.998 --> 00:19:58.432 position:16% line:89% align:start
Want my number, Hayakawa?

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.768 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, actually. I'm good, thanks.

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
On second thought, I'll take it!

00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:08.241 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA] Hmm!
-[HAYAKAWA] There.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.877 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now we can text whenever!

00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:11.779 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh!
-Ah!

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:13.346 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's snowing!

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.784 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Uh!
I love a white Christmas,

00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:18.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
it's always so romantic.

00:20:18.452 --> 00:20:19.654 position:41% line:89% align:start
Me too.

00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:21.388 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a little cliche,
don't you think?

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:22.990 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd like to think the universe

00:20:23.124 --> 00:20:25.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
just wanted to give us something
special this Christmas.

00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:28.361 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd like to think that too!

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.898 position:33% line:83% align:start
How much snow
do you think we'll get?

00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:32.667 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It'd be great if it piles up.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.635 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] And then we can all
make snowmen together!

Ah! I love that idea!

I'm on the fence.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.942 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] What ears
would you want, Hayakawa?

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:42.610 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Why are you talking about ears?

It's shorter than I thought.

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:06.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'm a little too old to be
wearing this sort of thing?

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:08.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
Um! No, it's loungewear.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.470 position:41% line:83% align:start
This is
how it's supposed to fit.

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:13.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, it was a gift
so I've gotta enjoy it!

00:21:17.812 --> 00:21:20.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, how do I look, Takuma?

I don't know why I was expecting
an answer from a stuffed animal.

What would I say
to the real Shinozaki?

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.498 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.
