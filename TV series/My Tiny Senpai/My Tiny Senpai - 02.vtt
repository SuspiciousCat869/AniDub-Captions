gave these to us.

them out to everyone else later,

Childhood Friends to Lovers?

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.247 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must choose.
But they're both so beautiful.

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:01.882 position:7% line:89% align:start
How about you just don't then?

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, keep me out of whatever
weirdness is in your head.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.620 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, you sure?

00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:07.922 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aggressively sure.

There is nothing there,
trust me.

You sure?

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:12.259 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stop asking.

00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:14.161 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just friends?

00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:16.664 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure I like
how disappointed you are.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, be that as it may.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.736 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since you're already here,
you might as well come

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.337 position:10% line:83% align:start
-and watch the show with me.
-What?

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:28.175 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thank you for dining with us.
Your table is ready now.

Please, follow me.

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.646 position:19% line:89% align:start
Quickly, to our seats!

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
How would I get roped into this?

[WAITRESS]
And here we are.

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:41.922 position:16% line:83% align:start
These are special tables
that allow you

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
to fully take in the view.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.461 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll let you settle in and then
I'll be back for your order.

to watch the magic.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
They won't be able to resist
the power of the couple's table.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:59.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's cool that this place
has side-by-side seating.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.741 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
That's not the point!

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everything looks so good
I don't know where to start.

Stop thinking about food!

[SHINOZAKI] I've never eaten
anywhere like this.

[SHIORI]
It's a first for me too.

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:10.785 position:7% line:83% align:start

less from our manager.

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:12.253 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's got great taste.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.121 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] I hate
how far off script they are,

00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:16.290 position:7% line:83% align:start
but they seem to be having fun,
so I guess it's all right?

00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:18.659 position:24% line:83% align:start
You sure seem to be
enjoying yourself.

Huh?

00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:25.900 position:30% line:89% align:start
The thing is...

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.134 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:29.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nothing in the world
brings me more joy

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:32.507 position:33% line:83% align:start
than cheering
on someone else's love life.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:38.412 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why can't I have a normal boss?
Is that too much to ask?

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:40.247 position:10% line:89% align:start
This one's a toughie though.

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.050 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was certain that the seating
would get their pulses pounding.

Oh! Look over there, Senpai.

Do you see it?

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.589 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
What am I looking for?

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:49.890 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you look right over there

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:51.358 position:27% line:83% align:start
you can pick out
our office building.

00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:54.462 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't see it.
Hang on, let me adjust.

It's so much easier

[SHINOZAKI] Whoa.
Oh, boy, she's really close.

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:21.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
[nervous] I think
I can even feel her... bust!

Huh?

00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:24.925 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is everything okay?

Yes, the view is really

you're all right, Shinozaki?

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now Shinozaki just needs to do
something to impress Katase,

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
and we can finally move on
to this evening's second act!

00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:38.205 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] But is it getting
hot in here or is it just me?

[SHIORI] I think
we should call it a night.

We still have to go work
tomorrow, remember?

Huh?
How is it that late already?

This might sound a bit weird

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:03.632 position:10% line:83% align:start

to spend more time with you, so.

Huh?

Could I walk you to the station?

Oh, hey. Morning.

Hmm? Bold choice.

an umbrella with Senpai!

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.061 position:10% line:89% align:start
My lucky item really worked!

But I'm so nervous.

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:18.065 position:21% line:89% align:start

How did you end up
being my Senpai?

And I knew that!

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:48.996 position:19% line:83% align:start

It's okay, you know.

[SHIORI] You do this
during meetings too.

Whenever it starts to get quiet,

00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:06.113 position:7% line:83% align:start
you freak out and start asking
a bunch of questions.

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:09.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know. I'm not very comfortable
with silences.

[SHINOZAKI]
That's because he's scary.

I know he's a nice guy,

that resting death glare.

I know exactly what you mean!

that you need to get over.

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:32.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
It takes time to learn how
to be comfortable in yourself.

Besides,
I know the chief doesn't see

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
your mouth as a flaw.

00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:38.912 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's said that you speaking up
makes it easier

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.615 position:16% line:89% align:start
for others to do it too.

He called out.
He said he caught a nasty cold.

No! That'd be weird, right?

You've been out for three days

a rough go of it living alone

so I brought you some stuff!

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:16.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then again, I get the feeling

00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:18.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she wouldn't see it
that way.

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:20.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Pardon!
-Huh?

00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:22.924 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:27.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's for you 'cause I wanted
to thank you for helping me out.

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.268 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, yeah.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:38.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sorry in advance
if it's not quite your style.

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.273 position:38% line:89% align:start
An apron?

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:44.311 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sobs]
I was wrong! It was too much!

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.217 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is so adorable!

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:53.453 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Thank goodness.
She likes it after all.

00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:55.623 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good. I'm glad.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you'll look nice in it.

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:02.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope you get some use
out of it.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:05.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh. You wouldn't mind me
coming by to cook for you again?

00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:06.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:08.468 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no,
I was actually talking about

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:10.671 position:7% line:83% align:start
you cooking at your own place,
not mine.

00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:13.040 position:35% line:83% align:start
Ah! Right!
That makes so much more sense!

00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:14.142 position:27% line:89% align:start
Silly me, ha, ha.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:15.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
Of course, you meant that.

00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:18.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would I jump
to such a wild conclusion?

00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:22.049 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
it's that wild of a conclusion.

00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:25.953 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'd be happy
to have you come over again.

00:21:26.087 --> 00:21:29.489 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:29.624 --> 00:21:32.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure. I'd also like
to do that someday.

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:35.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's good to hear.
Stop by whenever.

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:38.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
How 'bout now?
I'll give you the time off.

00:21:38.331 --> 00:21:39.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
-We're fine.
-We're fine.

00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:40.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Thank you very much!
-Thank you very much!
