Why's the changing room

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
so far from the venue?

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's risky enough
to attend a cosplay event

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:17.685 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the same town where I work.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.722 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, it's an off day,

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:23.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
there's a ton of foot traffic
and I'm nowhere near the office.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.392 position:27% line:89% align:start
I should be safe.

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who would I run into here
anyway?

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.430 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Hayakawa, is that you?

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.767 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well,
this is a pleasant surprise,

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:33.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
don't you think?

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:35.402 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, what's up?

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.780 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
I'm Chinatsu Hayakawa.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:47.147 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm 22 years old.

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:50.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm in my first year
at my first office job.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.387 position:13% line:89% align:start
And my boss just found out

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.256 position:13% line:83% align:start
how much of a massive otaku
I am.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.983 position:35% line:71% align:start
[whimpers]

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:30.051 position:33% line:71% align:start
Nice outfit.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.418 position:27% line:71% align:start
Where you headed?

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.989 position:33% line:89% align:start
[whimpering]

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:36.624 position:21% line:89% align:start
You must be mistaken.

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:39.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am not this Hayakawa
at whose job you are a manager!

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.895 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never said I was her manager.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.898 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Why'd I run into him
of all people?

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:45.633 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's a textbook normie.

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
I probably look like
some sort of deviant to him

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
in this costume.

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:53.240 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Well, what's this?

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.175 position:21% line:89% align:start
A cosplay event, huh?

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.443 position:33% line:89% align:start
So that's it.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.211 position:30% line:89% align:start
Quick question.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.647 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, what is it?

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.083 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is there a store
that sells outfits like those?

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.885 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
I made this costume myself,

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
so it's impossible
to get at a store.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.320 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:08.856 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
This is it.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.190 position:16% line:89% align:start
The beginning of the end.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's probably trying
to figure out

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
why a grown woman
would have such a weird hobby.

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.564 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:18.265 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess that's why you're
so comfortable wearing it.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.802 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Here comes the word
every otaku knows and fears.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.269 position:24% line:89% align:start
Something smite me

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.204 position:10% line:83% align:start
before I have to hear my boss
call me nerdy!

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:26.239 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's really cool.

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:28.810 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.879 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, you really think so?

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.882 position:13% line:89% align:start
I do. It's very impressive.

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:36.584 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.619 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:40.922 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hold on, back up a second.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.024 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just what about any of this
is cool to you?

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:44.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
Your vibe, I guess.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.060 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you trying to say?

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:47.729 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't have any hobbies,

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:50.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I have a lot of respect
for the people who do.

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:53.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why I think
people like you are cool.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.136 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.771 position:30% line:89% align:start
But then again,

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bet what you're going for
with that costume

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.975 position:7% line:89% align:start
is more cute than cool, right?

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.510 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Ah!

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
How's it possible
he can say something like that

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.947 position:21% line:89% align:start
with a straight face?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.849 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, still with me?

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:09.150 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, I heard you

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.852 position:33% line:83% align:start
and thank you
for the compliments.

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.520 position:41% line:89% align:start
[claps]

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.989 position:7% line:83% align:start
But please, do not tell anyone
in the office about this.

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:16.323 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.792 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why would you want
to keep it secret?

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please, I'm begging you!

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.995 position:10% line:89% align:start
But you're so amazing at it.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] You wouldn't say that
if you knew more about cosplay.

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:25.533 position:16% line:89% align:start
But that's not the point.

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:28.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd prefer if this could be
our little secret.

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.972 position:33% line:83% align:start
Pretty please
with a big cherry on top?

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.006 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:34.876 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're so cute!

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can you stop using
the word cute now, please?

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.212 position:35% line:89% align:start
No can do!

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:40.181 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's how I really feel.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
The first "cute"
was for how you look,

00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.252 position:13% line:89% align:start
your costume and all that.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.254 position:10% line:89% align:start
The second one was about you.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.287 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're not supposed to answer
rhetorical questions!

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.592 position:13% line:89% align:start
For the sake of my sanity,

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.628 position:33% line:83% align:start
let's pretend
I didn't hear that!

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.096 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
I don't understand.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.463 position:13% line:89% align:start
You really are cute though.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.065 position:35% line:83% align:start

La-La-La! I didn't hear you!

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.332 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't hear anything!

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now can we please stop talking?

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:10.178 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
I need to finish this soon

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I'm going to meet
the Comiket submission deadline.

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:15.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I can't focus
for the life of me.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
I still can't wrap my head
around the fact

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
that my boss knows
I'm a cosplayer.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.222 position:16% line:89% align:start
Surely he wouldn't blab,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I can't relax knowing
that he knows what he knows.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:25.026 position:41% line:89% align:start

had a delete button.

Where am I? What's going on?

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why'd it have to be like this?

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:36.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
Work's going to be a nightmare
now.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.773 position:19% line:89% align:start
My life sucks so much.

Hey, Senpai!

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
Could you review my submission
please?

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:45.313 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you're not too busy.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.548 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sure! I'm happy to help.

00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:49.050 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's see what you've got.

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.651 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can already tell
that you've done a good job

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
covering our bases,
so well done there!

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:54.288 position:35% line:83% align:start

Really? Thank you so much.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.523 position:35% line:83% align:start

I didn't get any work done

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:57.258 position:24% line:89% align:start
on my comic draft.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.860 position:30% line:89% align:start
I barely slept.

00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:00.261 position:24% line:89% align:start

-Oh!

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:05.733 position:30% line:89% align:start
You doing okay?

'Cause you're looking
pretty burned out.

[HAYAKAWA]
What? No.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:10.004 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm totally fine, honest!

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.173 position:16% line:89% align:start
A lot happened yesterday.

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:14.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm still recovering,
and I didn't sleep much.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:17.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
But sleep deprivation
can really wreck your health.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.479 position:41% line:83% align:start
Be sure
to take care of yourself, okay?

00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:20.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you're having trouble
getting to sleep,

00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:22.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
you can do what I do
and count kittens!

One cutie-wootie kitty,
two cutie-wootie kitties,

three cutie-wootie kitties--

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think you're supposed
to count sheep.

-Meow?
-I mean, cats are A-okay, too.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.263 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Katase, but I'm fine.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.731 position:16% line:89% align:start
I just need a quick nap.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA] Say, Hayakawa.
-Uh?

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:41.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't look so good.
You all right?

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where'd you come from?

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um... I mean, I'm good. Thanks.

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:48.743 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing to worry about.

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:49.977 position:41% line:89% align:start
Great.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:51.478 position:24% line:89% align:start
If that's the case,

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.615 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[AKINA] I was hoping

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
-for a chance to talk.
-Huh?

00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:58.219 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
In a nice, quiet restaurant.

00:06:58.352 --> 00:06:59.587 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.188 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Just the two of us all night.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:03.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] He wants to go
to dinner, just the two of us?

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:04.926 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like those things normies do?

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.962 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
That can't be what it is,
there's no way!

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:12.533 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um, I guess.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.969 position:10% line:89% align:start
But we can't be out too late.

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.203 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sounds like a plan.

00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:17.805 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come find me
when you've finished your work

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.607 position:35% line:83% align:start
-for today.
-[gasps]

00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:21.509 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:22.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Do you have a date?
-Hm.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, it's just a work thing.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.846 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it though?

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.615 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not a date!

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.151 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Right.

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:33.020 position:10% line:89% align:start
This isn't a date. Obviously.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.859 position:41% line:83% align:start
My boss
just happened to ask me out

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:41.228 position:5% line:89% align:start
to have a normal, boring dinner.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's all this is.

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:45.900 position:33% line:89% align:start
Nothing more.

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:49.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Sorry to make you wait.

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:50.938 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Hm?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.041 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:58.179 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
You okay?

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:00.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. I, uh... I'm good.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.284 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Thanks for the save.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:04.585 position:35% line:89% align:start
No problem.

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:06.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
Be sure to watch your step.

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:07.121 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Yeah.

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:08.689 position:21% line:89% align:start
Speaking of missteps,

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:10.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
doesn't this kind of feels
like your interview?

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:12.159 position:7% line:89% align:start
When you broke your high heel.

00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:13.761 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:15.796 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised you remember me
from that day at all.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.865 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, of course, I remember you.

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.235 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.971 position:13% line:83% align:start
I imagine you wish that day
had gone better.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.073 position:7% line:83% align:start
But you did ace your interview
regardless

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:28.109 position:41% line:83% align:start
and now
we get to work here together

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:29.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
and I'm glad for it.

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:31.379 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
He remembered me.

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:32.913 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:34.215 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] All right,
let's get a move on, shall we?

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:35.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right. I'm coming.

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.621 position:30% line:83% align:start
By now I expect
you've gotten used

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:41.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
to working at the office,

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:43.724 position:30% line:83% align:start
but do you have
any issues or worries

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:45.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
you would like to discuss?

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.962 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nope. Everyone
has been really nice to me.

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.096 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's great.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.765 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
That is definitely good to hear.

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:52.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've also impressed
the section chief

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:54.135 position:21% line:83% align:start
with how much faster
you are now.

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:55.469 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:57.071 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just learned
how to do the job is all.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:00.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] We've only been
talking about work stuff

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:01.375 position:24% line:89% align:start
since we sat down.

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:04.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seems like this really
was just a business dinner.

00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:07.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, by the way,

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
didn't you say you had something
that you wanted to discuss?

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.986 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Yes, that.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:14.722 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Here we go.

00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:17.091 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll admit this is sudden,

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
but please know
I say this in earnest.

00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:21.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.532 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Huh?

00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:24.799 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Hayakawa,

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:30.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
that day I ran into you,
it made me happy and excited.

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:32.740 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
[gasps]

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:33.707 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
I'd never felt that way

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.909 position:19% line:89% align:start
about a person before.

00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:39.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry to spring this on you,
but I can't hold back.

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:41.015 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Hold up.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:45.086 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is this not a business dinner?

00:09:47.288 --> 00:09:48.355 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you ready?

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:50.057 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes. Go on.

00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.392 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:54.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
May I accompany you
to your next cosplay event?

00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:55.930 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.032 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
What?

00:09:58.165 --> 00:09:59.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
I still can't get over
you making your own costume.

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.235 position:5% line:89% align:start
I get butterflies just thinking

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:02.803 position:24% line:83% align:start
about how much fun
it must have been.

00:10:02.937 --> 00:10:04.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why you asked me out
to dinner?

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, um, are you saying

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:08.543 position:33% line:83% align:start
that you want
to get into cosplay too?

00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:09.844 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Nope!

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I did look into it
after I got home

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:14.148 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I found out
about cosplay photo sessions.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.149 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then I got this.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.650 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:17.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd love the chance
to capture your exploits!

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.019 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
That's a scary mix

00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:20.888 position:38% line:83% align:start
of money
and low impulse control.

00:10:21.322 --> 00:10:22.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
But you don't need me

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you just want
to photograph cosplayers.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
There're plenty of them
out there.

00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
While that is true,

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:31.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
it was you who made me realize
how fun it could be.

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:32.299 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:34.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, yeah. You're the one I want.

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:36.937 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.406 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
It is so unfair

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.876 position:7% line:83% align:start
that he can say stuff like that
with a straight face.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.711 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hayakawa inhales]

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:45.112 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Fine, I guess.

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:46.147 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.382 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's an event coming up soon.

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:51.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's at the same place
where we bumped into each other.

00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:53.787 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[slams]
-But before any of that,

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
you have to watch
every single show

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.124 position:19% line:47% align:start
my costumes come from.

00:10:57.258 --> 00:10:59.860 position:24% line:35% align:start
Otherwise, I refuse
to let you take pictures!

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.296 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh... Adorable.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:03.532 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it!

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:05.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nothing that I just said
was cute!

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.168 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
I disagree.

00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
The genuine passion I saw
when you talked about anime

00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:10.804 position:30% line:83% align:start
-was very cute.
-[HAYAKAWA] That's enough!

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:12.239 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stop talking!

00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:13.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] I'm not sure
what the big deal is.

00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:15.142 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Stop talking! Stop talking!

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:17.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm begging you,
don't say another word!

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:20.848 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hm...
-[keyboard clicking]

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:22.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shinozaki.

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:23.918 position:24% line:89% align:start
Want to grab lunch?

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.253 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sure. We can go
as soon as I finish this up.

00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:27.788 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, sounds good.

00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:30.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did you need to talk?

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:34.128 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, kind of.

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.429 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:38.165 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me close this out
and I'll be right there.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll be waiting
in the lobby then.

00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:42.903 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have you ever noticed
how close those two are?

00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:44.905 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're definitely more
than just coworkers.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.340 position:41% line:83% align:start
That's
'cause they're old friends

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:48.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they were neighbors
for years.

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:50.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, right. I'd heard about that.

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.179 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh my, is somebody getting
emotionally invested here?

00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:56.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] You're reading too much
into things.

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.052 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or you're always picking on me

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you're long overdue
for some payback!

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:03.724 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hayakawa did say
they were just friends.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
Perhaps the lady
doth protests too much?

00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:07.127 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] The Slow Burn,

-[giggles]

[AKINA] Or Coworkers to Lovers

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:15.670 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which do I choose?

00:12:15.803 --> 00:12:17.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're both back on the table!

00:12:17.338 --> 00:12:18.772 position:35% line:83% align:start
There's not
a "to Lovers" anything

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:20.908 position:16% line:83% align:start
between Shinozaki and me,
I promise you!

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.810 position:44% line:83% align:start
Plus,
you're forgetting something!

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.211 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's a third option

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:26.113 position:33% line:83% align:start
that I think
you'd appreciate even more.

00:12:26.247 --> 00:12:28.382 position:10% line:89% align:start
A third option, did you say?

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:31.986 position:13% line:83% align:start
Trust me. All that you need
is a woman's touch.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.821 position:13% line:89% align:start
Will you be gentle with me?

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:35.690 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
This is canon.

00:12:35.823 --> 00:12:37.626 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's not
what I was getting at!

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:39.293 position:16% line:89% align:start
You brought it up though,

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.861 position:16% line:83% align:start
which makes me wonder why
you don't seem too interested

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:42.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
in what's going on
between the two of them.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:44.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
I'm not seeing?

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:45.533 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah! No.

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.702 position:7% line:83% align:start
They're friends so they can be
as friendly as they want

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:49.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
and that's perfectly fine.

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.904 position:19% line:83% align:start
Plus, why should I give
a single hoot

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.173 position:30% line:83% align:start
about something
that has nothing to do with me?

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:55.109 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you can answer
that question!

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.477 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it!

00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:58.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't just answer a question
with another question!

00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:00.447 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on, we need to figure out
where we're going to eat

00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:02.316 position:21% line:83% align:start
before the lunch rush
decides for us!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.286 position:27% line:83% align:start
-But why, Katase?
-Let it go, please!

00:13:06.688 --> 00:13:09.758 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Huh? How'd
he find out you're an otaku?

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.325 position:24% line:89% align:start
I got too careless.

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.960 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Well, that's vague.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did he catch you
drawing manga stuff?

00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:18.198 position:33% line:83% align:start
You could say
he caught me doing something.

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:20.134 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Shinozaki may know
I'm a mega nerd,

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:22.970 position:16% line:83% align:start
but he still doesn't know
about the cosplay.

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:24.639 position:33% line:89% align:start
In any case,

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:27.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure how him knowing
would be a problem for you.

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:28.442 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah.

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:31.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess it's not that serious
of an issue.

00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:34.281 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's more of a personal thing.

00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:37.151 position:7% line:89% align:start
So cute. You're cute. So cute.

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.219 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm...

00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:41.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
So why does it bother you then?

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:42.856 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Eh, it's fine.

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:46.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
At least he didn't catch me
working on my BL doujinshi.

00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:47.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.330 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where'd you come from?

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Please tell me
he didn't hear any of that!

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Are you and Senpai
here for lunch too?

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:56.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why so curious, huh?

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.472 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not that.

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:01.175 position:16% line:83% align:start
If anything I'm concerned
about that grin on your face.

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.744 position:19% line:89% align:start
Since everyone's here,

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.278 position:24% line:83% align:start
would you guys mind
if we all ate lunch together?

00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:06.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Sure, that's fine.
- Hurray!

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:10.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
That means I get to sit next
to my favorite Hayakawa-san.

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.620 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
[sighs] Be strong.

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:15.089 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the heck
is going on with you today?

00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:17.391 position:10% line:89% align:start
Time to see what looks good.

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.326 position:41% line:83% align:start

Oh, hey, Hayakawa?

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.361 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.429 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
What's BL?

00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:23.698 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:27.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's, um, kind of a genre
about kinds of people.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.838 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Huh?
Are you feeling okay, Hayakawa?

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.271 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're as red as a cherry.

[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah.

00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:07.107 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I'm still recovering

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.209 position:30% line:83% align:start
from that scare
you gave me a second ago.

'Tis the season, after all.

a trick or a treat?

[gasps] Are you sure Senpai?

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:17.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't have any candy with me.

Hey, no worries!

Right.

doing that thing it does
and with cat ears on.

-[AKINA] Yep.

And now we match too!

00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:02.963 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
I don't think cat ears

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.098 position:10% line:89% align:start
are work-appropriate attire!

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:06.634 position:41% line:47% align:start
Meow...

00:16:09.871 --> 00:16:13.273 position:13% line:83% align:start

is a big bowl of candy!

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:15.242 position:13% line:89% align:start
Halloween is the best, huh?

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.911 position:24% line:89% align:start
It is pretty great.

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:20.380 position:7% line:83% align:start

not to overindulge on sweets.

it's the same for Christmas,

It's actually
super embarrassing.

00:21:13.741 --> 00:21:14.441 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:17.245 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure
how I feel about him.

00:21:17.712 --> 00:21:20.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, my heart's all jumbled up
about it.

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:22.250 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

[sighs]

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.953 position:38% line:83% align:start
I thought
I had her cornered that time.

00:21:26.087 --> 00:21:28.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
How about you corner
those pictures you took

00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:29.557 position:27% line:89% align:start
and delete them?

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.092 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Hm? Which ones do you mean?

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] You know,
the ones with me and Katase.

00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:34.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA] Oh, these?
-[Hayakawa screams]

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Don't show them,
get rid of them!

00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.331 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Can I make it my home screen?

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.034 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Absolutely not!
