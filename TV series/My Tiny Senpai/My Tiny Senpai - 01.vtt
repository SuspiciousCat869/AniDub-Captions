00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's bizarrely motivating!

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:50.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
I appreciate the encouragement.

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:51.572 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, the thing is,

00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:53.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
I tend to get really bad
performance anxiety

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.409 position:10% line:89% align:start
about these sorts of things.

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.477 position:7% line:89% align:start
But there's this superstition.

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:58.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
You write the word "person"
on your hand

00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:00.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
and if you swallow it,
you calm down!

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:03.117 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's probably totally fake,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.819 position:21% line:89% align:start
but I heard somewhere

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
that there are certain pressure
points in the palm of your hand

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
and if you trace "person"
into it,

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:09.790 position:10% line:83% align:start
-you can press them which...
-[SHIORI] Earth to Shinozaki!

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:11.025 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]  I wrote the word
down for you!

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:17.431 position:21% line:83% align:start
This'll make you feel
all better. So swallow it!

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:19.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on. Better not waste it!

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.168 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She's so close to me!

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:23.771 position:24% line:83% align:start
Senpai's tiny hand
is inches from my nose!

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:27.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, it kinda seems like
a waste to eat it!

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:28.576 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:31.379 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can always make
some more for you, silly!

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:33.881 position:7% line:89% align:start
So go ahead and eat it all up!

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:36.384 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I'm dying! She acts like a wife!

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:40.254 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, in that case,
I guess I'll eat it.

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:41.489 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:42.857 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm...

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:48.129 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:49.330 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did my breath tickle you?

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll be more careful!

00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:52.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it's okay!
I didn't mind it!

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.435 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you feeling any better?

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:57.271 position:21% line:89% align:start
I am! I can do this!

00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.040 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks for your help.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe you can write
another one for me

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
before my presentation
tomorrow.

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.412 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll have one ready for you.

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:06.213 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whatever I can do!

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.152 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Miss Yamagishi?

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.087 position:13% line:83% align:start
Will you be coming to this
month's drinking party?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.355 position:30% line:89% align:start
You bet I will!

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:15.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll add you to the list, then.

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:18.159 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] Are you in charge
of planning it?

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:20.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I drew the short straw
this time.

00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.364 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hayakawa,
you coming to the party?

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:24.665 position:41% line:89% align:start
Or no?

00:09:25.534 --> 00:09:26.535 position:44% line:5% align:start
Huh?

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:29.003 position:44% line:5% align:start
-Nah.
-Oh, what a surprise.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're as sociable as ever, huh?

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:32.039 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shut up, okay?

00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:33.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
I went one time.
Isn't that enough?

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:35.843 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Uh-huh, only the first time.

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, and that was plenty.
-Hmm?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.448 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:41.982 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-Hm?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.553 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you guys dating
or something?

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:46.187 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Dating?
-Dating?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.823 position:10% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki seems pretty comfy
talking to you, Hayakawa.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.458 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, you've got it all wrong!

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hayakawa and I have been friends
since we were kids, okay?

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.228 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, exactly!

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.263 position:7% line:83% align:start
He and I just grew up together,
that's all!

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:01.869 position:13% line:83% align:start
Does it seriously look like
Hayakawa and I are going out?

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.471 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Shinozaki?

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:06.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're super comfortable
with Hayakawa, right?

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
You, too, Senpai?

00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.376 position:41% line:83% align:start
Listen,
it's not what you're thinking.

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:10.878 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please let me explain!

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:12.847 position:24% line:89% align:start
We were neighbors,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
so we happened
to go through preschool,

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.117 position:35% line:83% align:start
elementary,
and middle school together.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.718 position:38% line:83% align:start
And then
through total coincidence,

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.854 position:16% line:83% align:start
we both ended up working
at the same company.

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.256 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're cursed by fate, I guess.

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.361 position:21% line:83% align:start
It just seemed to me
like you two were pretty chummy.

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:28.629 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold up.

00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:30.264 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is she jealous?

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:33.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, please,
as if that would ever happen.

00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:35.202 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's nothing between us.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:38.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure, she and I get along
super well, but that's just...

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:39.640 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm kinda jealous.

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:42.643 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:45.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did she really just say
she was jealous?

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:47.481 position:41% line:83% align:start
No way!
I'm not hearing things, am I?

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:51.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, she does seem a lot
more mopey than usual today.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:53.954 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can't believe she's jealous!

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.090 position:24% line:89% align:start
If that's the case,

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:59.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
then does that mean
that she has feelings for...

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:02.429 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Um, Shinozaki.

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:05.232 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was wondering if...

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:12.940 position:13% line:89% align:start
If maybe you might wanna...

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
You think you could introduce me
to Hayakawa

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
so that I can be friends
with her too?

00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:25.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've always wanted
to get to know her more.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's so cool and aloof.

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:28.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
But there's never been a chance

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:30.024 position:30% line:83% align:start
to get together
outside work hours.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:32.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, I was wondering
if you could maybe introduce me?

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.094 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it?

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:35.896 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.798 position:24% line:89% align:start
[exasperated laugh]

00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:40.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just realizing
I'm an arrogant swine is all.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:41.769 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

It's funny.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've always been like
a magnet for cats.

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:58.553 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I can tell.

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:02.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] My Tiny Senpai
will be right back!

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:07.061 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI] Woah.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
This box is a lot heavier
than I expected it to be.

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.931 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Careful, Senpai!
Let me carry that!

[COWORKER]
I'm so sorry about this.

00:12:13.568 --> 00:12:16.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it's okay.
Don't even worry about it.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
This kind of thing happens
all the time.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.908 position:30% line:83% align:start
Keep me posted
if you need more help, okay?

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.309 position:35% line:83% align:start
[COWORKER]
Thanks for understanding.

00:12:23.444 --> 00:12:24.845 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shinozaki.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.715 position:16% line:89% align:start
What was all that about?

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was a little bit
of a mix-up with some data,

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
but we've got it
all worked out now.

00:12:40.528 --> 00:12:43.632 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't get mad, no matter
how badly people screw up.

00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:47.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Is that what you think?
-Yeah, like before.

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
If someone's already kicking
themselves for messing up,

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:53.941 position:30% line:83% align:start
I see no reason
to make matters worse.

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:55.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
Plus, there are ways
to correct someone

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.811 position:7% line:89% align:start
without flying off the handle.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.582 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, and that reminds me,
Shinozaki!

00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:02.082 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.285 position:19% line:83% align:start
You haven't been making
enough reports lately!

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.655 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I haven't been?

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:07.988 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aw, crap.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:10.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which reports did I miss?
And is this...

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.495 position:35% line:83% align:start
her version
of flying off the handle?

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:17.599 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sorry. I'll do better.

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:19.900 position:13% line:89% align:start
Anytime you've worked hard.

00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:22.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
I expect you to report to me
about it!

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:23.937 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:25.707 position:7% line:89% align:start
Only when I work hard. Really?

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
Precisely!

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to stay up to date
on everything you're doing.

00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:32.212 position:35% line:83% align:start
Especially
if you gave your best effort.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] If this is
her version of discipline,

00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:37.951 position:27% line:89% align:start
then count me in!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.422 position:30% line:89% align:start
As your Senpai.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:47.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
When you do well
it's my job to praise you.

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.432 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:56.370 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
So next time I work really hard.

00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:57.905 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then you better tell me,

00:13:58.038 --> 00:13:59.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I'll do my best
to pay attention!

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you for supporting me.

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:05.179 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.514 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:09.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's time to get back to
the office and work, work, work!

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:10.851 position:35% line:89% align:start
You got it!

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.554 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm right behind you!

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:17.991 position:16% line:89% align:start
[keyboard keys clacking]

00:14:19.594 --> 00:14:21.028 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's getting late,

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.330 position:35% line:83% align:start
but I dunno
if I'm ready to stop yet.

00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:25.933 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll finish this up at least.

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.708 position:10% line:83% align:start
I accidentally got two drinks
from the machine

00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:35.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
so you can have that one.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.144 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Thanks, that's really nice.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.613 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, right, I should probably
reimburse you!

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
I should probably reimburse
you! Let me see.

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:42.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
-That won't be necessary.
-I think I might have some...

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:43.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Just consider it my treat.
-...spare change in here.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.451 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:46.253 position:7% line:83% align:start
Besides, I'm simply pawning it
off on you.

00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:48.322 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's kinda like an abuse of
authority, you get me?

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Greatest abuse
of authority ever!

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:53.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
Have you still not finished
doing all your work for the day?

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.229 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, not yet.

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:58.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was just planning to finish up
with this part before stopping.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, I'd be happy
to give you a hand with it!

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.604 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay,

00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:04.739 position:5% line:83% align:start
you seriously don't have to go
out of your way to help me out.

00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.373 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nonsense,

00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:09.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's a Senpai's duty to help her
little kohai. You get it?

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:10.678 position:21% line:89% align:start
And when we're done,

00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:12.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll abuse my authority again
and take you to dinner!

00:15:12.647 --> 00:15:13.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] The sequel

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.550 position:7% line:83% align:start
to greatest abuse of authority
ever!

00:15:15.683 --> 00:15:16.618 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay.

00:15:16.751 --> 00:15:18.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, you can do this part.

00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:20.287 position:38% line:89% align:start
No prob!

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:22.824 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
at how quickly you managed
to finish everything tonight.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:26.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was all because of you.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.328 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the assist.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:30.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which means it's only fair
if I pay for dinner!

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:31.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not happening.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:33.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll be treating you.

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'm gonna pay.
-No, I'm paying!

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I'll pay!
-No, I will!

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:40.809 position:13% line:83% align:start
I forgot that it was still
a little cold at night.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:43.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's get to dinner
before we freeze to death.

00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:47.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:49.183 position:19% line:89% align:start
So you don't get cold.

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:50.919 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you don't have to!

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:53.053 position:33% line:83% align:start
Put your arms
through the sleeves, please.

00:15:53.187 --> 00:15:55.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's okay! I'm not that cold.
I swear!

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.291 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't be silly.
I want you to know

00:15:57.424 --> 00:15:59.993 position:7% line:83% align:start
your authority's not the reason
I do this stuff.

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.596 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:04.264 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:06.500 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll try to remember that
in the future.

00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:11.305 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's not too late yet,

00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:13.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
so there should be
a lot of places still open.

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.275 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sounds good.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
But, um, are you sure you aren't
too cold without your coat?

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.148 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. I'm alright.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Shinozaki's jacket
is so comfy and warm,

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:26.788 position:24% line:89% align:start
like a big blanket.

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.156 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's probably
'cause he was wearing it before.

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.793 position:13% line:89% align:start
But still, it's very nice.

00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:34.596 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe it has something to do
with how big and cozy it is,

00:16:34.729 --> 00:16:38.465 position:10% line:83% align:start
but in a way, it kinda makes
it feel like he's hugging me!

00:16:39.968 --> 00:16:42.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
What am I thinking?
I'm getting too carried away!

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.372 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, um...

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:50.077 position:41% line:83% align:start
I dunno
how much more I can take.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.513 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's just too much!

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:52.446 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you good?

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, you can have it back now!

00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:56.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
But you're cold?

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.619 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're almost to the restaurant
so it'll be fine.

00:16:57.752 --> 00:17:01.288 position:7% line:83% align:start
And besides, we're pretty close
to the office.

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:04.024 position:30% line:83% align:start
If someone saw,
they might get the wrong idea.

00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:05.793 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah, guess you're right.

00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:09.797 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I totally should've
considered that.

00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:13.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, no, I really appreciate you
letting me borrow it for a bit!

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:16.004 position:30% line:83% align:start
What do you say
we head inside and grab a bite?

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:18.305 position:16% line:89% align:start
My tummy's pretty rumbly.

00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:21.308 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.214 position:7% line:83% align:start
Welcome in! Oh, a party of two?
You can just follow me.

00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:32.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] The jacket
still smells like Senpai!

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.788 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is everything okay?

00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:36.123 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Uh, it's nothing!
Nothing at all!

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
Phew, it's a little warm
in here, isn't it?

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.629 position:27% line:83% align:start
I should probably
take this thing off.

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:46.199 position:19% line:89% align:start
It all looks so tasty!

00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:48.368 position:27% line:83% align:start
There are so many
delicious things to choose from.

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:50.203 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't even know
where to start.

00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:52.674 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Take all the time
you need to decide.

00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:54.241 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you already know
what you wanna eat, Shinozaki?

00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:58.312 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah, I think so.

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:00.247 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, well then,
I better not keep you waiting!

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
Seriously, there's no hurry!

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.455 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay! I decided!

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:11.593 position:38% line:5% align:start
[SERVER]
Be there in a moment!

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:15.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me see, I'll have
the miso-glazed beef tongue

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:16.764 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the mixed vegetable stew.

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:19.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
And an order of
the fluffy soymilk pudding

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:20.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
for dessert, please.

00:18:20.568 --> 00:18:22.770 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll take the
saikyo-yaki mackerel dinner.

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:24.038 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not gonna get
any dessert?

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:26.674 position:38% line:89% align:start
Should I?

00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:28.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pudding is just so fluffy
and tasty, ya know?

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's gotta be one of
my favorite things ever.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.013 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's super soft, and sweet,
but not too sweet.

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:33.915 position:10% line:89% align:start
Pudding for me too, I guess.

00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:35.349 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SERVER]
You got it!

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:36.985 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll be back with your food.

00:18:38.052 --> 00:18:41.723 position:10% line:83% align:start
By the way, I've been wanting
to thank you for helping me out.

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:43.290 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't just mean today.

00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:44.759 position:27% line:89% align:start
When do you mean?

00:18:47.662 --> 00:18:48.596 position:33% line:89% align:start
That speech.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
I got through it
with no problems

00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:52.399 position:10% line:83% align:start
and that's all thanks to you
helping me.

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:53.935 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Don't thank me!

00:18:54.068 --> 00:18:55.369 position:19% line:89% align:start
You were so successful

00:18:55.503 --> 00:18:57.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
because you put in all that time
to prepare it.

00:18:57.639 --> 00:19:00.642 position:7% line:83% align:start
All I did was help to get you
out of your head a little bit.

00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:02.543 position:33% line:89% align:start
And besides,

00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:04.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd never leave you high and dry
if you needed assistance.

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:07.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because that's my job
as your Senpai!

00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:11.451 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, just know
that I appreciate everything.

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:13.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey. I'm here for you!
But, you know,

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:18.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
don't go pushing yourself to
work overtime every day, okay?

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:20.293 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hard work is good,
but burnouts bad.

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:22.830 position:7% line:83% align:start
So don't push past your limits,
'kay?

00:19:24.632 --> 00:19:25.533 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:26.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SERVER]
Here we are, you two!

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.937 position:38% line:83% align:start
I've got
the saikyo-yaki mackerel.

00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:32.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
And the miso-glazed beef tongue.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.207 position:27% line:89% align:start
I hope you enjoy.

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.744 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's dig in, shall we?

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:39.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tonight we're gonna eat
our fill,

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
and then tomorrow
we'll give it our best again!

00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:44.418 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.121 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thank you for the food!

00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:50.457 position:35% line:83% align:start
-It's hot!
-[SHINOZAKI] Are you okay?

00:19:51.092 --> 00:19:52.459 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yeah.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:54.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] So cats
do have sensitive tongues.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:55.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI] What was that?
-[SHINOZAKI] Uh, nothing!

00:19:55.563 --> 00:19:56.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
Talking to myself!

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.935 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Meow.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:04.005 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:06.406 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:08.876 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:11.713 position:10% line:89% align:start
Morning, Senpai. How're you?

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.782 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, good morning, Shinozaki!

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:15.850 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm doing fine.

00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
You trying to summon
more cats today?

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:20.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yep! And this time it'll work!

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:24.424 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought I heard him meowing
just a second ago.

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:26.127 position:35% line:89% align:start
Meow-meow.

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:27.795 position:35% line:89% align:start
Meow-meow.

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:29.296 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:31.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, did you hear that?

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:34.267 position:41% line:83% align:start
I think
the cat finally answered!

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.503 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Uh-huh.

00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:39.540 position:24% line:83% align:start
Although, the meow
was a lot deeper than before.

00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:41.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe there are two cats inside?

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.544 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're a total meanie!

00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:50.952 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
you would tease me like that!

00:20:51.085 --> 00:20:52.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look, I'm sorry!

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.755 position:30% line:83% align:start
I didn't think
you'd be fooled for real!

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
As your punishment
for this transgression,

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
you have to be a kitty cat for
the rest of the day, Shinozaki!

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.228 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm "Kitty Shinozaki" now?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now meow for me!

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.164 position:38% line:89% align:start
Um, meow?

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you think this is too far?

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.168 position:30% line:83% align:start
-No, it's not!
-But it's embarrassing.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.103 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You have to follow my orders!

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.738 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] Okay.
-[SHIORI] Get it together!

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:12.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're only allowed
to say "meow"!

00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:15.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Manager. G'morning.
-Oh, hi! It's you. Morning.

00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:17.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
You look amused about something.
What's up?

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:18.546 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, nothing.

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.014 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm just happy to see

00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:21.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
that my team is getting along
so swimmingly.

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:22.950 position:38% line:89% align:start
Are they?

00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:25.086 position:16% line:83% align:start
Alright, then, Meowzaki.
It's time to go to work!

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:26.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes, Ma'am! I'm coming!

00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:28.388 position:27% line:89% align:start
Cats don't speak!

00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:29.924 position:24% line:89% align:start
You've gotta meow!

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:31.626 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.927 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:36.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's do our best today, okay?

00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:38.633 position:24% line:89% align:start
My kohai Meowzaki!
