[SHINOZAKI] I work for a Santa
who's so small and cute.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.823 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've got a lot of presents
to deliver this year!

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:24.324 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's do our best for the kids!

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.392 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.695 position:35% line:83% align:start
Here we go.
We're almost there.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Just a little more.
[SHINOZAKI] -It's as big as her.

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:31.198 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmmm!

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Hey, Santa?

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.135 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mind sharing that joy?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.070 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:41.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.577 position:30% line:89% align:start
Silly reindeer!

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.112 position:30% line:83% align:start
I know today is
our busiest day of the year,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.347 position:7% line:83% align:start
but let's try not to overdo it,
okay?

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:50.217 position:30% line:83% align:start
Can't share joy
if you don't have enough energy.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.888 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Santa?
-Yes, what?

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:57.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
While I do appreciate the hug,
I wasn't asking for one.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was offering to carry
some of the presents.

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:04.264 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aaah!

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh no, I'm so sorry for that!

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:07.936 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, it's fine.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.971 position:38% line:83% align:start
It was a
simple misunderstanding!

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.775 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Mistake or not,
I just got a hug from Santa!

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.376 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I'm so embarrassed,

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
but he said it's fine
and it's Christmas.

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:21.049 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.984 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, just thinking about
yuletide cheer!

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.652 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:27.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
A very Merry Christmas,
one and all!

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:30.123 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.760 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:34.729 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[chimes]
-Huh?

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Dreams can be weird, huh?

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.802 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
How does he know about it?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.998 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] Oh, my!
This is quite the turnout!

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.633 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.035 position:7% line:83% align:start
You probably have better things
you could be doing today.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.136 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not a thing!

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, why not help out a friend?

00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, I helped draw
your doujinshi.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.442 position:7% line:89% align:start
Of course I'd help you sell it.

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.410 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I can't argue with that.

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:33.047 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hmm! I wish I could though.

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.449 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snoring]

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know what that sigh
means. Manga pains?

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:40.454 position:13% line:89% align:start
The deadline's in two days.

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:42.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
I asked my artist friends

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
if they could help,
but they were all too busy.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. That sounds rough.

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:48.763 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Rough, you say?

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear. How so?

00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:52.299 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's really not that bad!

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.369 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:58.371 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's an outside of work thingy.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm happy to help in
any way I can!

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.343 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you, but I'm not sure

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
how qualified you are
to help me.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:07.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You'd be surprised.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.416 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was qualified enough
to draw this

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.819 position:21% line:83% align:start
in-store installation
template for us.

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:13.154 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way?

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you on a new game plus?

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.858 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't believe I am.

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:21.162 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay. Are you hearing me?

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.964 position:19% line:89% align:start
Loud and clear, ma'am!

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:26.134 position:13% line:83% align:start
And did you get the link to
the cloud folder I sent to you?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.168 position:35% line:89% align:start
I sure did!

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.870 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.205 position:7% line:83% align:start
Could you please work on pages
sixteen through twenty-two?

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:35.342 position:7% line:83% align:start
I sure can! And could you check
my work as I finish each page?

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.011 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's fine.

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.147 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] I wasn't sure
about working with a normie

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
on an eighteen-plus book,

00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:43.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if I do all the spicy scenes
it should be fine.

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:47.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] I have to say,
I'm very impressed, Hayakawa.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:48.388 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:49.991 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is incredible!

00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:52.292 position:10% line:83% align:start
And to think you made it all
from scratch.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.530 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hmm! It's kind of you
to say that.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:59.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] But considering this
is a BL doujinshi

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
of an already existing property,

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't call it
"from scratch".

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:06.507 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just finished my first page!
Tell me what you think!

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.810 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow, he's fast.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.411 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nice work!

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:13.181 position:7% line:89% align:start
Except you should have told me

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
I accidentally gave you
a spicy scene to work on!

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.520 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:21.589 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know what,
this has been a lot of fun!

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.791 position:30% line:83% align:start
Our first joint
creative project.

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.727 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now there's a new hot
and heavy BL in the world.

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.596 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the product of our love!

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.031 position:21% line:89% align:start
For my sanity's sake,

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.233 position:10% line:83% align:start
please stop talking about it
like it's a baby!

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.570 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here's hoping our love product
will sell like hotcakes!

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:36.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm starting to think

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.240 position:27% line:83% align:start
that sounds like
a more fitting title for it.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.575 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.409 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HARUNA]
Is that Chika, IRL?

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:46.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, how have you been?
I haven't seen you in forever.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.951 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey Haruna! I've been doing
pretty good since last summer.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, I can see.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.055 position:30% line:89% align:start
How do you do?

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.057 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Boyfriend!
-What? No!

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.490 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's from work!

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.293 position:16% line:83% align:start
I told you I needed help
finishing my doujinshi

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
and he stepped up!

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:04.332 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh! You guys must work
well together then. Really well.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why do you say it like that?

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.635 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.770 position:30% line:83% align:start
Excuse me miss,
but is that charm Hime-chan

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:11.572 position:10% line:89% align:start
from the Kimihime-chan anime?

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
A man of culture?
How did you get into it?

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
On the recommendation of someone
whose opinion I trust highly!

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:20.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
My girl here.

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.650 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:25.052 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.287 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yup, boyfriend!

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
I keep telling you
that's not true!

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:31.458 position:30% line:83% align:start
[NEWS ANCHOR 1]
Good night everyone

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:33.794 position:13% line:89% align:start
and have a happy new year!

This year is almost over.

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:49.476 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not weird if I call him
on New Year's, right?

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:52.613 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NEWS ANCHOR 2] We're back
covering one of the cities'

00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:54.048 position:19% line:89% align:start
biggest annual events.

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
Once again, the hall
is full of excited fans.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] That's weird.
Who'd be calling this late?

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:02.623 position:10% line:83% align:start
[REPORTER] What did you think
of the event? Is this live?

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:04.292 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Is this happening right now?

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.860 position:13% line:89% align:start
Senpai's really calling me?

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.628 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Don't say that on TV!

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:09.997 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Of course,
I can't believe I forgot!

00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:13.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
We exchanged contact info
over Christmas!

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:29.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, is everything okay?
I can call you back if need be.

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:31.185 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>No, no, I can talk now!</i>

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.687 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, what's up?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.157 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to call and say
thank you for everything you did

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.591 position:30% line:89% align:start
this past year.

00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:39.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank me, but why?

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:42.129 position:38% line:89% align:start
 <i>Because!</i>

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:45.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've made such amazing
improvements over the past year.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's been a joy to see you grow.

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've even helped me
do better too.

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:51.372 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:54.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Really?
I kinda felt like a nuisance

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.043 position:24% line:89% align:start
more than anything.

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:57.578 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't you know?

00:07:57.712 --> 00:08:00.114 position:10% line:83% align:start
When your senpai calls you to
thank you for a job well done,

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:03.017 position:21% line:83% align:start
then you can just say
"Go me!". Okay, now say it.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, if that's the case
then I guess go me?

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.923 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right,
you take that compliment!

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:12.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh? Did I just sneak in one last
abuse of authority

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:14.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
before the year was over?

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I hope she keeps
abusing her authority

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:19.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
into the next year
and every year after!

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.802 position:16% line:89% align:start
And hey, one last thing.

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:25.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of all the kohais I could've
had, I'm glad I have you.

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.143 position:19% line:89% align:start
Me too! But in reverse.

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:30.578 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:32.913 position:41% line:89% align:start
I, um.

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:36.751 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad I have you as a senpai.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>You're the only one</i>
 <i>I could ever want.</i>

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:41.622 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.459 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Anyway,

00:08:45.593 --> 00:08:47.661 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm looking forward to another
year of working together!

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:50.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Yeah, same.
Let's keep up the good work.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:54.503 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chimes]

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:57.538 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] I sensed something.
You should go to the Hatsumode

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.839 position:38% line:89% align:start
Manager?

00:08:59.508 --> 00:09:01.675 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It could be fun.

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:04.678 position:35% line:83% align:start
Especially
if Senpai came along too.

00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:06.814 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe I should invite her.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:07.982 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:11.252 position:33% line:83% align:start
My little bro
has a girlfriend now?

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.255 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:17.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
What could've possibly given you
that extremely wrong impression?

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:20.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, how else do you explain
that cute getup you've got on?

00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:23.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey! It was a gift from
my senpai at work.

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:26.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your senpai? At work?

00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:28.335 position:19% line:89% align:start
Um. What is happening?

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.038 position:30% line:89% align:start
A lady senpai?

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.908 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, she is a woman.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.910 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on,
I know what you're thinking.

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:37.678 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's not like that in any way!

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:41.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
So it's true. At long last my
little brother's found a woman.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.818 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Are you even listening?

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] My Tiny Senpai
will be right back

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
after this cat nap. Meow!

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:53.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki invited me to
Hatsumode this year.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.830 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wonder what I should wear
to the shrine.

00:09:56.964 --> 00:09:59.967 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] One of my superiors
at work, my Senpai.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is a small and cute cat!

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:06.207 position:13% line:89% align:start
Senpai, please speak to me!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's going on here?
What happened to you?

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you've
been abandoned.

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:14.849 position:27% line:83% align:start
Meow, meow, meow!
Meow, meow, meow, meow!

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:17.618 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Oh, my goodness.

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:21.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's so cute.
Like so, so damn cute!

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, can I pat your head, Senpai?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.962 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:31.165 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Meow!
-Huh!

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.101 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.403 position:27% line:89% align:start
Argh! I am dead.

00:10:36.538 --> 00:10:37.838 position:21% line:89% align:start
I am completely dead.

00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:39.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have been killed by
unbridled cuteness!

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.879 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh! Ah!

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:48.249 position:13% line:89% align:start
Meow meow. Meow meow meow!

00:10:48.382 --> 00:10:50.451 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:53.420 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
My cause of death was cuteness.

00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:56.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
The box says "please adopt me"
but I can't!

00:10:56.257 --> 00:10:59.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I take something
as adorable as her home.

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:02.429 position:19% line:83% align:start
My body would never be
able to handle it.

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.065 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:06.467 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow?

00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.435 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.138 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you doing, Senpai?

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:12.907 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:16.511 position:13% line:83% align:start
While it's true that humans
and cats are both animals,

00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:19.813 position:16% line:83% align:start
there are just some lines
that must never be crossed!

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:21.550 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Meow.

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:23.250 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:27.288 position:35% line:89% align:start
Meow. Meow.

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.323 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:32.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I can't believe
that was my first dream

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.094 position:27% line:89% align:start
of the new year.

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:35.896 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chimes]

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.466 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Dreams can be weird, huh?

00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:40.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Come on!

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:46.807 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I just woke up

00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:49.376 position:35% line:83% align:start
and somehow
I've been turned into a cat!

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:53.714 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm no veterinarian,
but that should be impurrsible.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.684 position:13% line:83% align:start
And why does this box say,
"adopt me"?

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.117 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did someone abandon meow?

00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] What's this?
-Meow! Meow!

00:11:58.687 --> 00:12:00.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
An abandoned cat?

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:03.224 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Huh!
What's Shinozaki doing here?

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
Aaah! Help me!
I've been turned into a cat

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:07.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I don't know how or why!

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
Would it be all right
if I touch you?

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:13.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow?

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:15.169 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is my kohai from work,

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:18.072 position:10% line:83% align:start
and he just asked if he could
give me scritches.

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:20.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
I should be su-purr embarrassed.

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:23.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
Instead, I feel something
different.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.581 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's this urge deep inside me.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:31.720 position:30% line:83% align:start
I, I don't know
if I can hold back.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.088 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.357 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I can't resist it any-meow-or!

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:40.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pet me, please!
Give me all the scritches!

00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:44.064 position:10% line:89% align:start
I cat believe what I'm doing.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.835 position:13% line:89% align:start
I shouldn't want to do it.

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:52.206 position:27% line:89% align:start
But I cat resist!

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you say?
Does kitty want some pets?

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:00.214 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nice kitty.

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:04.351 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:06.387 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's purr-fect.

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:10.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki's hand
is feline so nice.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.794 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yeah!

00:13:14.395 --> 00:13:16.665 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Does it feel good
when I touch you there?

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:20.267 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Uh!
You gotta be kitten me!

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:23.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
Saying it like that makes it
sound paw-sitively naughty!

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:29.243 position:10% line:89% align:start
But then, it does feel good.

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:32.747 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinozaki.

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:37.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want you to stop.
Don't stop petting me.

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:40.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
Even when I'm not a cat.

00:13:44.158 --> 00:13:46.561 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, that was certainly
a crazy way to start off

00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:47.662 position:33% line:89% align:start
the new year.

00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:49.963 position:38% line:89% align:start

Dreams can be weird, huh?

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
How does he know about it?

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:02.677 position:7% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA] I'm Yutaka Shinozaki,
an office worker.

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:06.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
And my brother's been very
suspicious since he came home.

[laughs]

I've got big plans tomorrow.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, how nice.
Are you meeting someone?

00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:15.657 position:24% line:89% align:start
Someone from work.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.257 position:10% line:89% align:start
My bangs are getting too long

00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:20.127 position:10% line:83% align:start
and now I don't have any time
for a haircut.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.963 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no doubt about it.

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:25.999 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's got himself a girl!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.402 position:21% line:89% align:start
Strap in, little bro.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's time to give
you a pop quiz.

00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:32.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
I feel like I should be worried.

[YUTAKA] You're walking down
a road, living your life,

00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:38.011 position:13% line:83% align:start
when suddenly three animals
are in front of you.

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.080 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you could give rubbies
to one of them,

00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:41.382 position:24% line:89% align:start
which would it be?

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:43.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like belly rubs?

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:45.486 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
A. A clever pupper.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.287 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:49.724 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
B. A nubile cougar.

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:52.259 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why is that even an option?

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:54.194 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
Or C. A widdle kitty.

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:58.932 position:10% line:83% align:start
Urgh! I guess I'd go with C?

Well, dear brother,

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:06.574 position:10% line:83% align:start
it appears this mystery woman
of yours is the kitty type.

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:09.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, how would you describe
the kitty before you?

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:11.111 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why is there more?

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.981 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
A. She is fluffy.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:16.216 position:19% line:89% align:start
B. She's meow-meow-ey.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure every
cat goes "meow".

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.622 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
C. She is smiley.

00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:22.456 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of cat is gonna smile?

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.658 position:38% line:89% align:start
Whatever.

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:27.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess she's fluffy, meowy,
and smiley.

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:29.764 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:34.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA] Interesting. My brother
found himself a fluffy-wuffy,

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:37.304 position:33% line:83% align:start
meow-meow-ey,
smiley-wily kitty type of girl.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:40.508 position:5% line:89% align:start
The investigation must continue!

00:15:40.642 --> 00:15:43.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
I need to see how fluffy-wuffy,
meow-meow-ey,

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:46.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
smiley-wily this woman truly is!

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:49.183 position:35% line:89% align:start
She's here.

[SHINOZAKI]
So, adorable.

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:12.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm looking forward to it too.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's one of the best
parts of the job.

00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:17.612 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Shinozaki.

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:20.013 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.516 position:47% line:89% align:start

I had that dream. So awkward.

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:33.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
It looks like we're in for
another sweet,

00:16:33.628 --> 00:16:34.829 position:24% line:89% align:start
candy-coated year!

00:16:34.963 --> 00:16:36.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
Manager? What in the world
are you talking about?

00:16:36.965 --> 00:16:39.032 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, you know what I mean.

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:42.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
Not me. What's a "candy-coated
year"?

00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
There she is.

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:46.306 position:10% line:83% align:start
My brother's itty bitty kitty
mystery woman.

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:48.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
How is she all those things
and more?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't think it was possible
for a creature

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:51.546 position:24% line:89% align:start
that cute to exist!

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.180 position:10% line:89% align:start
Her hair is fluffy and wuffy!

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:54.516 position:19% line:89% align:start
And she's meow-meow-ey,

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.451 position:33% line:83% align:start
and her smile
is so smiley-wily too!

Step away from the senpai!

You mean this is normal?

00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:37.190 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, she's always like this

00:17:37.324 --> 00:17:39.126 position:19% line:83% align:start
when she's around tiny
and cute things.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.228 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see!

00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:43.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think Mom would
let me keep her?

00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:46.099 position:27% line:89% align:start
She is not a pet!

Hello, Shinozaki's sister.

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
Meow! Who's this?

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:51.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's our manager at the office.

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:53.173 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
Oh hey, Chika.

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:54.341 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:56.410 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, you're my brother's boss?

00:17:56.544 --> 00:17:58.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
Bingo you hit the nail
on the head.

00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:00.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know he and Katase are
such a great pair.

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:02.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can honestly say
that I've never seen

00:18:02.817 --> 00:18:05.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
a more excellent work duo
in my life.

00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:08.488 position:7% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki's thorough but overly
cautious approach to his work

00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:10.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
is a perfect match
for Katase's dynamic

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:12.627 position:10% line:83% align:start
and supportive authoritative
style.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
But it goes far beyond their
contributions

00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:17.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
as they also help create
a positive work environment.

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:20.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:21.903 position:41% line:83% align:start

May I have your name?

00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:23.170 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's Yutaka.

00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:26.239 position:41% line:83% align:start
Yutaka.
Do you have any siblings?

00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:27.942 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aside from your brother?

00:18:28.076 --> 00:18:30.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, I don't. It's always just
been the one little brother.

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:33.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
And if you could have had
another sibling,

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:34.682 position:16% line:89% align:start
what kind would you want?

00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:36.584 position:24% line:89% align:start
I see. That's easy.

00:18:36.718 --> 00:18:41.089 position:7% line:83% align:start
A sister. Ideally a younger one
who's as cute and fluffy as her.

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.926 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well then, that could happen

00:20:03.137 --> 00:20:04.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
that must mean.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.975 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Oh, um.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.178 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH sigh]

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.679 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Hey, you two!

00:20:11.813 --> 00:20:13.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna pick me
to give the big speech

00:20:13.548 --> 00:20:14.749 position:30% line:83% align:start
or whatever at
the wedding, right?

00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:16.017 position:24% line:89% align:start
You should pick me!

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm the groom's sister,
so it should be me!

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.587 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm the groom
and the bride's boss.

00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:21.689 position:27% line:83% align:start
-It should be me!
-No, it's me!

00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:23.024 position:41% line:89% align:start
No, me!

00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:25.626 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Family trumps everything.
-That's so old-fashioned!

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.061 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
That speech is mine!

00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:28.629 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
I very much disagree!

00:20:28.763 --> 00:20:30.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Oh, that's great,
now there're two of them.

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:32.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You two, decide!
-You two, decide!

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What are we deciding on?
-What are we deciding on?

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:38.005 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:39.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now that I think about it,

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:42.043 position:10% line:83% align:start
did Yutaka ever go that crazy
over you?

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:43.144 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:45.780 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, I am in no way small
or cute enough for her

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:48.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
to ever react to me
like she did with Katase.

00:20:49.717 --> 00:20:51.318 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.320 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm!

00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:55.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I think you're small

00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:57.491 position:30% line:83% align:start
and cute enough
to go crazy over.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.561 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:06.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Manager, that's uh.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:09.302 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm thinking we print Shiorin's
face on these cute plates

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
and give them away
as wedding favors.

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:12.740 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I'm "Shiorin" now?

00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.041 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
What about my face?

00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:15.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
You don't matter.

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:16.677 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's just mean!

00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.846 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why not let your guests
pick from a catalog?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.348 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Could you please
stop putting ideas in her head?

00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:25.052 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Urgh!
That's quite enough of that!

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:26.654 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Okay, fine.

00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:29.190 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:31.358 position:10% line:83% align:start
How about we all go and enjoy
the shrine together now?

00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.860 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Sounds like a plan.

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:34.361 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder what food stalls
they have.

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:35.663 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
No, thank you.

00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:37.231 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
You wanna put cat ears on?

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:39.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Absolutely not! I said no!

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Ooh, cotton candy!
