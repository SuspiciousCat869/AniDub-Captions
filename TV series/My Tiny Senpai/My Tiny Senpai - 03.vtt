Zakishino! Akina around?

[SHINOZAKI] Would it kill you
to be more professional

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.016 position:30% line:47% align:start
at work, dude?

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.886 position:7% line:89% align:start
And who in the world is Akina?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.120 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's me! I'm Chihiro Akina!

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.790 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, so it's you, Boss!
I'm sorry.

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
Shinozaki, is Katase here?

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.728 position:21% line:89% align:start
She's out right now,

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.428 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I think she should be back
pretty soon.

00:00:28.563 --> 00:00:30.565 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, so you remember
her name, huh?

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Oh-huh!

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.401 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's my Senpai.
Of course I'd remember!

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.775 position:10% line:83% align:start
Zakishino, just so you know,
it is Tuesday, my dude.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.276 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.579 position:7% line:83% align:start
And yet, it's still the weekend
in my heart, Bro.

[sighs]

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.549 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm being held prisoner
by a Tuesday

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
while I'm dreaming
about the weekend!

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:53.021 position:7% line:83% align:start
Would you quit being dramatic?
It's just a Tuesday.

[startled]

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.725 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:06.568 position:16% line:83% align:start
Gimme a break! This week
is gonna last forever!

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
You do know it's the same
length as last week was?

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:12.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know, but it's gonna
feel like an eternity!

-[SHIORI] Shinozaki!
-Hey, Senpai.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.443 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you know what you wanna do
for lunch today?

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:19.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I made plans with Yamagishi.

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:20.815 position:35% line:89% align:start
Okie doke!

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:23.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to eat
together tomorrow, then!

-[both wave]
-Step, step, step.

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:29.891 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I don't mind
if the week is longer.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:32.560 position:27% line:89% align:start
I wish I was you.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.422 position:35% line:65% align:start
-Shinozaki!
-Yes?

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.858 position:33% line:83% align:start
How 'bout it?
Ya wanna get lunch?

[SHINOZAKI]
My boss at work

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
is someone I really
don't understand.

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tell me, how's work been?

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:22.603 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's been a lot of fun,
actually!

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:24.505 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though, that's mostly
'cause of Senpai.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.339 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm glad to hear it.

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.910 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've had a rough time
finding new employees.

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:31.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
Katase was so excited
you got hired.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've got to say, she was
a handful when she found out.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Was she really?
-Sure was.

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:40.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
It feels like yesterday
she was making that face.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.289 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, it's all settled.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.324 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be
interviewing this one.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, tell me everything!
Is it a boy or a girl.

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:49.396 position:21% line:89% align:start
Interview went well.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's going to be joining
the team.

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.068 position:19% line:83% align:start
When are you expecting?
I hope it's soon!

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:55.737 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
It's funny.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.437 position:7% line:83% align:start
The way she phrased it made it
sound like I was pregnant.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:00.141 position:38% line:83% align:start
-My boy.
-I'm sorry, what now?

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.709 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Boss.
-[sighs]

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.711 position:10% line:89% align:start
Would you please stop telling

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:05.880 position:10% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki such weird stories
about me?

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:07.548 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Senpai?

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:10.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
Pardon me. The tuna and mushroom
Arrabbiata, please, with shrimp!

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:12.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
Quit pretending like
you don't hear me!

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:14.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, I can hear you
loud and clear!

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:17.257 position:35% line:83% align:start
She's cute
when she's angry, huh?

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.359 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sighs]
Uh, yeah. Senpai's the cutest.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop making him say that stuff!

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:24.565 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, now.. since
you're already here, Katase,

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
why don't you join us for lunch?

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.301 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Um, okay.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.938 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wow. Time really flies.

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:32.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know, it makes me nostalgic

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.175 position:30% line:83% align:start
to think about
when you first joined us.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, it wasn't very long ago
that you hired me, Sir.

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh. I guess that's true.
Katase remembers.

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:42.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand
why it's so important

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
that we keep talking
about this stuff!

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.221 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll be working with all of you
starting today!

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:51.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
My name is Shinozaki Takuma!
It's nice to meet you!

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.293 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm your boss, Akina. Welcome.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.998 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sir! Thank you in advance for
your guidance and support!

00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:59.432 position:7% line:89% align:start
I promise you I'll do my best!

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.269 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
I want you to meet Katase.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.870 position:7% line:89% align:start
She'll be sitting next to you,

00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:05.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
so if you have any questions,
feel free to ask her.

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:06.240 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:07.742 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Katase.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.178 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you need anything at all,
let me know, okay?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.246 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She's so tiny!

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.981 position:13% line:89% align:start

[SHINOZAKI] Who is this
absolute cutie before me?

00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:18.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's no way I got this lucky!

-Someone's giddy.
-[gasps]

Just let me have this!

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.324 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cheers]

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.927 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Adorable.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, we'll start by
getting your PC set up

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:29.429 position:27% line:89% align:start
and ready to go.

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:30.698 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Right.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
This company seems awesome.

I think
I'm really gonna like it here.

If I make a single mistake,
she's gonna freak!

Forget a kitten,
this girl's a tiger!

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.114 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec!

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
Were they just being sweet
so I'd lower my guard?

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
Was this all part of
some grand scheme

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:52.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
to evaluate me?

00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:55.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
-This one's a dud.
-I think you're right.

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:56.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
If that's true,

00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.025 position:19% line:83% align:start
then I gotta get my act
together!

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
I might not have made
a good impression,

00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:01.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
but maybe I can salvage this!

[sighs] Huh?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.873 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's a network password?

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:15.710 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I did everything
correctly.

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:17.245 position:35% line:83% align:start
And this is
all the onboarding info

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.846 position:33% line:89% align:start
they gave me.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.116 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, that means I've probably
gotta ask her for help.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
But if I screw up the timing,
she'll be furious!

-If I ask too soon.

to solve it yourself first?

If I wait too long.

You waited this long before
asking me for help?

Well, way to waste my time.

Aw man!

Calm down. I'll start by
checking the guidelines again.

it's your branch name

Shinozaki.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
If there's anything
you don't get,

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:08.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm more than happy
to help you out!

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:12.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm at your beck and call,
my sweet kohai!

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.034 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.702 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've been seen!

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
The boss is gonna make fun of me
if I get too excited again!

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've gotta focus up
and try not to smile too much.

[notices]

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.010 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like he might be
struggling with something.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:26.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
This looks like a job
for his Senpai!

00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:28.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you're looking for the
network password,

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:30.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's your branch name
and ID number.

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:32.820 position:38% line:83% align:start
[stammer]
Thank you. That's helpful.

[gasps]

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, sorry! I shouldn't
have taken over!

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:38.893 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, it's all good!

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:40.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
I really should have asked
for help sooner!

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:41.896 position:16% line:89% align:start
Next time you need help,

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
don't be afraid to come
and talk to me!

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.666 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.601 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I guess she was worried, too.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you for looking
out for me, Senpai.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.174 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.277 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is it bad to call you Senpai?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
If that was unprofessional,
then I'm sorry!

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.849 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cheers]

00:08:04.418 --> 00:08:06.287 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Senpai?
-I'm right here!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.289 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Senpai?
-Yup, that's me!

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:09.523 position:41% line:89% align:start
Senpai?

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:10.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
Gosh, darn, right,
I'm your senpai!

[SHIORI]
I'm sorry. It's just,

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:17.164 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been trying really hard to
stay calm about it,

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:20.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'm all kinds of excited
about having my first kohai.

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, I got a bit carried away

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:24.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
and forgot to behave like
a proper senpai.

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.507 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry! If you're happy,
then I'm happy!

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
Everything's cool!

00:08:27.742 --> 00:08:29.643 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm excited to have a senpai,

00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:31.479 position:35% line:83% align:start
so I guess
we are on the same page.

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:33.080 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:34.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well then, I guess

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:37.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's a day of first
for the two of us, isn't it?

00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:38.586 position:21% line:89% align:start
Keeping that in mind,

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.955 position:30% line:83% align:start
what do you say
we both give it our best?

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:42.957 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh. Sure.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.658 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sensing the vibes are spicy!

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.163 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
No, you're not!

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:52.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, that takes me back.
What's this?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.435 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong, you two?

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:56.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just a little bit
embarrassing

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:57.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
to think about this, that's all.

00:08:57.772 --> 00:08:58.572 position:41% line:89% align:start
Agreed.

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.241 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.376 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then allow me to make it up
to you with something sweet.

00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:06.614 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go ahead and pick any dessert
you'd like. It's on me.

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seriously? Thank you so
much, I would love that!

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.385 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't know what to pick!

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.588 position:13% line:83% align:start
Senpai, you know he's just
trying to distract you.

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Are you saying you
don't want dessert, Shinozaki?

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cause if you don't,
I'll happily eat your share!

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.961 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
No, I do!

00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:22.563 position:13% line:83% align:start

Don't take my cake!

I blew it in the meeting.
I always get super anxious.

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:44.718 position:10% line:89% align:start
That does happen a lot, huh?

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.821 position:24% line:83% align:start

you backing me up.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.495 position:13% line:89% align:start

[SHINOZAKI] Something
about that cat plushie.

00:10:27.328 --> 00:10:29.930 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Something
about that dog plushie.

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
-It really reminds me of Senpai.

Are you saying

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:39.807 position:16% line:83% align:start
I look this cute to you,
Shinozaki?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, what I mean is that.
It's just.

It's the perfect time!

00:10:50.885 --> 00:10:53.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mean, you are
awfully cat-like.

Do mew really think so?

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.259 position:35% line:83% align:start

Downright paw-sitive.

00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:02.163 position:13% line:83% align:start
Speaking of which, is this
how you see me, Senpai?

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.797 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, absolutely.

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's something
about the look in his eyes.

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:08.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
And when you add that he's
a little puppy in a bear hoodie,

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.905 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd say that makes him
at least 90% Shinozaki!

00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:13.040 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
So, we're the same then?

to get them for you?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.483 position:10% line:89% align:start
[shocks] Do you know how to?

00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:23.684 position:38% line:89% align:start
Think so.

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:24.985 position:16% line:89% align:start
When I was in high school

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:27.087 position:33% line:83% align:start
I used to go
to the arcade a lot.

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I wound up having a
pretty huge collection

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:30.891 position:10% line:89% align:start
of cute plushies like these.

00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:33.294 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow, Shinozaki!

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.362 position:33% line:83% align:start
You must like
cute stuff a lot, huh?

00:11:35.496 --> 00:11:38.533 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yep! It's one of the reasons
I applied to Sunpick,

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:42.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
to be a part of the process
of creating cute things.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.639 position:19% line:89% align:start
The feeling is mutual.

[shocks]

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.374 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:49.210 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Oh, that's what she meant!

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:51.445 position:35% line:83% align:start
Guess I got
a little ahead of myself.

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:53.515 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you okay there?

00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:55.816 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah! I'm good.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our mascot Meowtaro,
he's really cute too.

00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:00.921 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so?

00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:03.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] We had a ton
of Meowtaro merch at home.

I am and she adores him.

You know what,
now that I'm thinking about it,

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:11.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's probably 'cause of her
that I like cute stuff.

aren't you Shinozaki?

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.406 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I mean, I don't know
if I would phrase it that way.

All right,
let's win you some plushies.

00:12:32.654 --> 00:12:34.788 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah! I believe in you!

00:12:35.724 --> 00:12:37.191 position:41% line:89% align:start
[whirs]

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:41.095 position:13% line:83% align:start
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.631 position:38% line:89% align:start
[excited]

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:43.797 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.399 position:41% line:89% align:start
[upset]

00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:47.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
You were so close, too.

00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:49.803 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Her expressions
are worth the loss!

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:52.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I can get it
if I try again.

00:12:52.674 --> 00:12:54.141 position:21% line:89% align:start
You really think so?

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.678 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I'll do anything
to protect that smile.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.946 position:41% line:89% align:start
[whirs]

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:02.850 position:13% line:83% align:start
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:04.451 position:38% line:89% align:start
[excited]

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.520 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shocks]

00:13:05.654 --> 00:13:07.087 position:41% line:89% align:start
[upset]

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.990 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could have swore you
we gonna get 'em that time.

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:11.892 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I could watch this all day!

00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:14.895 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, Senpai.
Let me try again.

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:17.532 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it,
Shinozaki. It's fine.

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:19.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you lose this time.

00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:22.102 position:7% line:89% align:start
My budget's set at 30,000 yen!

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:23.470 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Her height may be lacking,

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:25.105 position:13% line:89% align:start
but her wallet is packing!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.242 position:41% line:89% align:start
[whirs]

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:29.611 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go.

00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:31.912 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maybe this time?

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.082 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.950 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
The kitty's caught on the puppy!

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:37.885 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chicken clucks]

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:39.086 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.689 position:30% line:89% align:start
[clucking push]

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both excited]

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:44.693 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
All right!

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:45.859 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both realize]

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.595 position:30% line:89% align:start
Um. I'm sorry.

00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:49.063 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine!

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:51.498 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] You got them both!
That's amazing!

00:13:51.633 --> 00:13:55.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh. It was honestly
just a coincidence.

00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:58.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Maybe this little fella
would've been too lonely

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
without the other one,
so he hitched a ride.

00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:02.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. You might be right.

00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:05.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Wait! Didn't you say
that one reminded you of me?

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, in that case I think
they should stay together.

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:11.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
That way they'll never
get lonely again.

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.221 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Together!

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.592 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both giggle]

00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:20.795 position:10% line:83% align:start
Calm down! She's just talking
about the stuffed animals!

00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:22.096 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now that we have 'em.

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.198 position:13% line:83% align:start
We need to give them names,
right?

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:26.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since this one kinda
reminds me of you,

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:28.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
we should give him
your first name.

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.269 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, Takuma!

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't that a little on the nose?

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.774 position:16% line:89% align:start
But "kuma" means "bear".

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, it's right there
in your name.

00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:36.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't have a problem with it.

00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:37.679 position:21% line:89% align:start
If the dog is Takuma,

00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:41.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
that means the cat's name
is going to be Shiori?

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:43.016 position:19% line:89% align:start
That makes sense to me.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.519 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Does it, though?

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:48.922 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think they'll get along just
like a senpai and a kohai.

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:50.859 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Uh, I guess you're right!

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:54.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
It feels like I've got a million
 butterflies in my stomach!

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:55.929 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hey, Shinozaki?

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thanks a lot for winning
both of these.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:14:59.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was really thoughtful of you.

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.368 position:38% line:89% align:start
[blushes]

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:04.639 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm just happy
that I could make you happy.

00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:06.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks! [chuckles]

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:12.814 position:16% line:83% align:start
That means the cat's name
is going to be Shiori?

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.148 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] All right!
Back to the office we go!

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.522 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Right!

00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:25.125 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
Hayakawa. Shinozaki.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:27.862 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're coming with me
and no questions asked.

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:29.296 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both confused]

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:31.932 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
A Meowtaro video game?

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:35.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep! I volunteered to be the one
in charge of designing it,

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:38.238 position:33% line:83% align:start
but I wanted
to get your opinions on it.

00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:39.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
What kind of game is it?

00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:42.075 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's gonna be
a dating simulator!

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:43.711 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's brilliant, I know.

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.213 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both stunned]

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.650 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, you're making a Meowtaro.

00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:50.317 position:19% line:89% align:start
Dating simulator game?

00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.720 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I've already programmed
the start menu.

00:15:52.854 --> 00:15:54.522 position:16% line:89% align:start
Feast your eyes on this!

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:56.056 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:57.692 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both sigh]

00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.259 position:33% line:11% align:start
[inaudible].

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:02.095 position:21% line:5% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] Say hello
to the sexy human Meowtaro!

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:04.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
My plan is to tap into the
demographic that's crazy

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:05.999 position:24% line:89% align:start
for hot anime boys!

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.669 position:21% line:89% align:start
You sure about that?

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's not such a bad idea.

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, it might work.

00:16:10.872 --> 00:16:14.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
But would the fans of classic
Meowtaro be interested too?

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:15.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I'm surprised
you're all still here.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:19.614 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
A classic fan appears!

00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:21.281 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:23.518 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, Katase. I'd love to get
your opinion on my project!

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:25.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to make
a Meowtaro game!

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:28.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh wow, you had me at Meowtaro!

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:29.557 position:33% line:5% align:start
Check it out!

00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.358 position:33% line:89% align:start
[dead inside]

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:33.060 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you think, Katase?

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:36.163 position:7% line:5% align:start
It's a game where you can date
a hot human version of Meowtaro!

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.699 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That's Meowtaro?

00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:39.299 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's hot now? And human?

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.970 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's Meowtaro?
What's happening?

-[overwhelmed]
-[scared yell]

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:47.407 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think your game totally fried
Senpai's circuits!

00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:50.110 position:10% line:83% align:start
What I really wanted from you
were some stories

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:52.647 position:7% line:89% align:start
about your romantic escapades!

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.081 position:24% line:89% align:start
Romantic escapades?

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a dating sim.

00:16:55.817 --> 00:16:57.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was wondering if you guys
could share any stories

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.987 position:16% line:89% align:start
about your dating lives.

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.622 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you've got anything juicy,

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:02.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
it might give me a little
inspiration for story routes

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:03.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
to put in the game, you know?

00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:07.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't know if I have
anything like that.

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:11.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's kind of a big thing
to spring on us.

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:16.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, same for me. I don't have
any juicy stories to give ya.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
You mean all three of you
are total romance rookies?

[all sigh]

00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:22.276 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait.
If I'm remembering right,

00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:24.378 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you came to
interview for Sunpick,

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:26.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
didn't you say you met
your Prince Charming

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:27.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
on that same day?

Oh, gimme the deets!

Well, it's really

00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:38.693 position:7% line:89% align:start
as you're making it out to be.

Just my luck.

00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:48.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, this would happen
before my interview.

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:50.137 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm doomed.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.438 position:33% line:89% align:start
What do I do?

00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:53.541 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Miss? Are you alright?

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.209 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:57.912 position:13% line:89% align:start
Have you got an interview?

00:17:58.046 --> 00:17:59.479 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh. Yes.

00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:02.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just a second.

00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:04.886 position:24% line:89% align:start
That should do it.

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:06.654 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you for your help, sir.

00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:08.623 position:27% line:83% align:start
It'll take a bit
until it's completely dry

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.425 position:24% line:83% align:start
but for the moment,
just try it on.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:12.694 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.529 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, sure.

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:22.436 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's perfect. Good luck.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.838 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.506 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.140 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.544 position:30% line:89% align:start
See you around.

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:34.348 position:16% line:89% align:start
Does he work at Sunpick?

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:39.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE OFFICE WORKER]
Next applicant, please come in.

00:18:39.687 --> 00:18:40.855 position:41% line:89% align:start
Coming.

00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:44.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Will I get to see him
again if I land this job?

00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:45.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, I can't think about that!

00:18:46.027 --> 00:18:48.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need to focus on passing
this interview!

00:18:48.696 --> 00:18:49.931 position:38% line:89% align:start
[knocks]

00:18:50.064 --> 00:18:51.264 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Good afternoon.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.137 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank you for your time.
Chinatsu Hayakawa.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.806 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:02.910 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:03.044 --> 00:19:04.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] So, the person
who helped you out

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
was one of the people
interviewing you?

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you ask me,

00:19:07.782 --> 00:19:09.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
it sounds like you were
destined to meet each other.

00:19:09.684 --> 00:19:13.054 position:10% line:83% align:start
Who was this mystery hottie?
Did you get to see him again?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.622 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I did.

00:19:14.756 --> 00:19:17.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
But he was a little different
than the first time.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:21.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's like fireworks.

00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:24.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're a lot prettier
from a distance.

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.768 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[all stunned]
-Why was that weirdly deep!

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:28.201 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
What do you want from me?

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
I gave you a story,

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
so why don't you share something
juicy with us, Yamagishi?

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:33.473 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
What? Me?

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:35.043 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's nothing to tell.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.376 position:13% line:89% align:start
Look, if I had experience,

00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.345 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have to ask you
amateurs!

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:39.847 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Oh, right.

00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:41.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] At least
pretend that's surprising.

00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:46.854 position:16% line:89% align:start
Romantic escapades, huh?

00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:51.993 position:38% line:89% align:start
[notice]

00:19:52.694 --> 00:19:54.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Since this one
kinda reminds me of you,

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
we should give him
your first name.

00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:58.099 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, Takuma!

00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:00.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is so embarrassing.
I can't believe I said that!

00:20:00.935 --> 00:20:03.538 position:10% line:83% align:start
The moment just keeps running
around in my head.

00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:06.473 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ugh, honestly.
The heck is wrong with me?

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:09.177 position:10% line:89% align:start
Anyways, it's just a plushie.

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:12.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
It isn't like it's actually
Shinozaki, so it's no biggie.

00:20:12.847 --> 00:20:14.247 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hang on, I swore I had one.

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:20.353 position:41% line:83% align:start
Ta-da!
Now he's got a little necktie!

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:24.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
I do say, he looks dashing!

00:20:24.192 --> 00:20:26.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now he looks even more like him!

00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:28.261 position:35% line:83% align:start
Calm down.
You're overthinking it.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.263 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's just a little plushie,
that's all.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.265 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just a little plushie.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.874 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:20:40.007 --> 00:20:43.276 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's a plushie.
Just a harmless little guy.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.580 position:41% line:89% align:start
[hums]

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:59.927 position:7% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should rearrange them
a bit so that I can't see him.

00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:01.328 position:35% line:89% align:start
[startled]

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:05.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
Shiori fell on top of Takuma!

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
[both flustered]

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shiori.

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.040 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Takuma.

00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.610 position:38% line:89% align:start
[lean in]

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:20.515 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
No, Shiori! You can't kiss him!

00:21:31.324 --> 00:21:32.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:35.930 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
They're just Shiori and Takuma.

00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:39.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
A Senpai and Kohai
who get along. Yeah!
