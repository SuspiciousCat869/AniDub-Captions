[Hayakawa groans]

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.579 position:24% line:89% align:start
Life is so unfair.

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:13.280 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why am I stuck here

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.283 position:16% line:83% align:start
instead of getting pruney
in a hot spring?

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:18.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
-We just got back.
-[Hayakawa sulking]

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you go
for New Year's?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because between visiting family
and holiday obligations

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't have any time

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:26.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
-for a vacation!
-[SHINOZAKI] Calm down.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:28.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can't tell me
recharging at a hot spring

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
doesn't sound like a great idea.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
Being outside,
surrounded by nature's beauty.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.369 position:19% line:89% align:start
All the while serenaded

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
by chirping birds
and babbling brooks

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:40.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
as perfectly hot water
melts your problems away.

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sign me up for this
office worker's paradise please!

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:45.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Well, she's
definitely got Senpai

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.080 position:33% line:89% align:start
on her side!

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just think, we all need
some TLC for the soul!

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's for sure.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
I get exactly where
you're coming from.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.124 position:19% line:83% align:start
I bet they'd even have
a local kitty to play with.

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:58.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't think of a better escape

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
from this harsh concrete jungle
that we all live in.

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:03.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Not good.
Senpai's trapped herself

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
on her own fantasy island!

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, why don't we go
at the end of the month?

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:09.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll use our PTO
and play hooky!

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.973 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Sounds like an awesome idea!
-[giggle]

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.608 position:10% line:89% align:start
You wanna join in on the fun?

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.511 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't it be kind of weird
for me to go though?

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:18.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, you don't want
to see your Senpai

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.180 position:21% line:89% align:start
fresh outta the bath?

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm your Senpai,
fresh outta the bath.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.888 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's not,
not something I'd like to see.

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.123 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if I take time off now,
I might fall behind.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:31.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA] I say go for it.
-Huh!

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.460 position:21% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Manager!

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:35.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
We are in a slow period
right now.

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
The point of paid vacation
is to use it up after all.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You're the best, Manager!
-You're the best, Manager!

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:43.938 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that case, why don't you
come with us too?

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.439 position:38% line:89% align:start
You sure?

00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:47.407 position:33% line:83% align:start
It'd be weird
if I was the only guy.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.344 position:27% line:83% align:start
I love that idea.
Let's all go together.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:53.081 position:21% line:83% align:start
It wouldn't be as fun
without the entire gang there.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.916 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so too?

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.518 position:38% line:83% align:start
I guess.
If he really wants to.

00:01:58.086 --> 00:02:01.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
All of us at a hot spring.
Huh?

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.824 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Senpai.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:04.491 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, Shinozaki.

00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:06.027 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hayakawa.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinozaki.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.496 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, come on!

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.666 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Um, Katase?
-Huh?

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all chuckle]

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I wouldn't miss this
for the whole world! -Quit it!

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you keep that up,
then you can just stay at home!

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:57.905 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] This place
is even more charming in person!

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
And just think on any other day

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
we would all be chained
to our desks!

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:05.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[HAYAKAWA] Thank you, PTO!
-While you do that,

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'll go check us in.
-Oh.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, manager.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.618 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] It was nice of you
to drive us up here

00:04:10.752 --> 00:04:12.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
on top of handling
the reservations.

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:13.688 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Don't sweat it.

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:15.857 position:33% line:83% align:start
I enjoy doing
this kind of stuff.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.458 position:30% line:83% align:start
And I did share
driving duties with Katase.

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:19.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was kinda surprised
to find out

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
-that she could drive.
-[chuckles]

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.198 position:35% line:83% align:start
It makes me
wanna get my license.

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.067 position:47% line:83% align:start
Oh.
Good thinking.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
That way she can ride shotgun

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
while you drive us
on our next trip.

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.371 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean, that's one reason.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:33.007 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Shiori screams]
-[gasps]

00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:34.441 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was Senpai's voice!

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.911 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wait, is this
a murder hot spring?

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.179 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.914 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll save you, Senpai!

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:43.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Meow.
-[meowing]

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:47.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've died and gone
to fluffy wuffy heaven.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.422 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thankfully it's
a figurative death.

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:52.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, cats are a sign
of a good inn.

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
And you picked a winner!

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:58.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hello, widdle kitties.
Who wants hugs?

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:01.936 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.005 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] That was painful
to watch.

00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:06.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe they're too alike
for them to be interested?

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:08.643 position:7% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Senpai's not a cat!

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:11.612 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[crying] -She's got
some catlike qualities

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
but that's not something
they could pick up on, right?

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:16.851 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you think, Hayakawa?

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm a bit purr-occupied.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.221 position:27% line:89% align:start
A human cat tree!

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.524 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is your entire body
made out of catnip or something?

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:26.493 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chattering]

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:30.198 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was already impressed
that they had a hot spring pool

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.099 position:21% line:89% align:start
but this is gigantic!

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:33.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't this great?

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:36.304 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's year-round summer fun!
Let's make the most of it!

00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:39.140 position:7% line:83% align:start
I never thought I'd see Senpai
in a swimsuit,

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:42.844 position:16% line:83% align:start
let alone during winter.
I gotta keep it together.

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.914 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wonder what kind
of suit she has?

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:48.749 position:21% line:89% align:start
Maybe something cute?

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:53.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or maybe something
on the classy side?

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:56.524 position:35% line:89% align:start
Or maybe...

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:59.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Oh. Katase!
Over here!

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.963 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:11.873 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I was not expecting
something this mature!

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:14.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not good!
I can't let any dirty thoughts

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.676 position:21% line:89% align:start
creep out of my head!

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.745 position:24% line:83% align:start
I gotta stay calm,
she's still my Senpai!

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.115 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll just go with a casual,
nonspecific compliment.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
You two are rockin' those suits.

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.086 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's nice of you to say.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.021 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, thanks.
-Come on!

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can he say that
with a straight face?

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:33.661 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ah! How am I supposed to follow
that?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.697 position:16% line:89% align:start
You both look very nice.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.066 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
Um, thank you, Shinozaki.

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:45.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] She covered up?

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:48.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Why am I suddenly
so self-conscious?

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:50.378 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I can't believe
we're at the pool

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:53.547 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I'm missing out on seeing
Senpai's bathing suit.

00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:56.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should just ask
if she'd show it to me?

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:59.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, I'm pretty sure
that constitutes harassment.

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:02.990 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Shinozaki sighs]

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:04.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, did you bring
that inner tube

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:05.960 position:24% line:89% align:start
from home, or what?

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.129 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just bought it today,
actually.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.563 position:30% line:89% align:start
You work fast.

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:10.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hayakawa chuckles]

00:07:11.332 --> 00:07:12.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey! Let's go test that tube

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
-out on the lazy river.
-I like the sound of that!

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:16.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] The lazy river?
[HAYAKAWA] Come on!

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:17.437 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKINA] Coming!

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.140 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:21.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
As long as we're in the water,
it's okay if I see her suit!

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:23.144 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks Hayakawa!

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.879 position:41% line:83% align:start
Senpai!
Let's go!

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:27.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can all go on
and have fun.

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:28.549 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.620 position:13% line:83% align:start
She must really not want me
to look at her.

00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:35.488 position:30% line:83% align:start
The problem is
that I can't swim!

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:37.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
How about we try out
the wave pool.

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.360 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can all go ahead.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.962 position:16% line:89% align:start
I meant the kiddie pool?

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:42.129 position:33% line:89% align:start
Go on ahead.

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:43.564 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:49.537 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:53.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
Senpai, you don't know
how to swim, do you?

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.277 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm...

00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:58.478 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not that I can't swim!

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.114 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's just that
I never have before!

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:02.917 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kay, then that basically means
you can't swim.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.755 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't make fun!
I'm sorry, Senpai!

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:11.559 position:30% line:89% align:start
[boy laughing]

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:13.160 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mommy, can we get ice cream?

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:14.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Well, why don't we ask
your dad? -When I was little

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
I went into the deep end
and lost my footing.

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:20.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
[water gurgling] I could've
very easily drowned that day

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.504 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I've been afraid of it
ever since.

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.575 position:33% line:83% align:start
I do think it
would be fun and all, but...

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.043 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:32.513 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] In that case,
wanna go in together?

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.048 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:36.884 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm tall enough that I can
stand up in the deep end.

00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:39.153 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll watch out for each other,
okay?

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.057 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:44.692 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.528 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Alright!
I'll give it a try.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, it isn't as chilly
as I thought it would be.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.136 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not so scary after all, huh?

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.337 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nope!

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:57.972 position:13% line:89% align:start
In fact, I almost feel like

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.641 position:35% line:83% align:start
I can start
swimming now!

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:04.378 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Ahh...
-Huh?

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:06.547 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
What's the matter, Shinozaki?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.848 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nothing.

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:09.750 position:33% line:83% align:start
I must resist
any dirty thoughts!

00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:12.019 position:10% line:89% align:start
My Senpai is trying her best!

00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:16.123 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, are you ready
to teach me how to swim?

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.225 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm in danger.

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:19.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's start off small.

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:21.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
Try putting your face
in the water.

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:26.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Easy-peasy! Leave it to me-z!
Here I go then!

00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:30.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh, she might actually
pick it up quickly.

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.807 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whines]

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.408 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Or not.

00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:37.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
Normally, I can put my face
underwater with no issue.

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:38.846 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why not now?

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] You might be nervous
because of where we are.

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe it'll be easier
if you pretend

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.019 position:16% line:89% align:start
that you're in the bath.

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:47.822 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] The bath, the bath,
the bath...

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:50.858 position:33% line:83% align:start
[whimpering]
...the bath.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
-She's acting like a cat
that hates water! -[groans]

00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:56.464 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess we shouldn't start off
with submerging your face.

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:57.865 position:33% line:89% align:start
I-I'm sorry.

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.400 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's okay,
you might have better luck

00:09:59.534 --> 00:10:01.836 position:30% line:83% align:start
if you practice
with an inner tube for a while.

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'll go buy you one.
-Uh...

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:05.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:08.776 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shinozaki?

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.278 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[water bubbling]
-Oh, no! I got a cramp!

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:14.215 position:30% line:83% align:start
I got careless,
because the water's so shallow!

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:17.051 position:24% line:89% align:start
Somebody, help me.!

00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:21.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Shinozaki gasps]

00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:24.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is Senpai swimming?

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.361 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-[groans] You saved me...

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:29.564 position:35% line:89% align:start
Don't die!

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's okay, you can stop!
I'm still alive!

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:34.435 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, you're alright?

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:35.636 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.071 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:42.276 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.512 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:49.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
[weeping] I thought I'd lost you
for a second there.

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:51.520 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:54.955 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, I'm all good!
I've never felt better!

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, you can relax!
There's no need to cry!

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:58.826 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
-More importantly.
-Huh...

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:04.031 position:21% line:83% align:start
You started swimming
on your own!

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:05.232 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't be ridiculous,
nothing is more important

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:09.770 position:13% line:89% align:start
than you still being alive

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:11.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
-and well, Shinozaki!
-Forget I said anything!

00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.140 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, dizzy.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
Guess I didn't catch
my breath yet.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:18.412 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I can't let myself fall!

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.215 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh!
-Huh!

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:23.884 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.290 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:32.026 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.094 position:44% line:89% align:start
Safe!

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:37.298 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:44.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
Um, let me retie it for you.

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.044 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.614 position:41% line:89% align:start
There.

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.448 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Stealth.
-Okay. Nobody saw, right?

00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:56.984 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen, um...

00:11:57.318 --> 00:12:00.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry! I don't know
how to make it up to you!

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
You sure that's all
you have to say, Shinozaki?

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:06.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? Uh, would it help
if I bow?

00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:08.062 position:19% line:89% align:start
Or write you a letter?

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.731 position:35% line:83% align:start
Never mind,
just forget about it.

00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:11.865 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:14.468 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmph!
-Wait! Senpai!

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:21.041 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.882 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] My Tiny Senpai
will be back in a moment!

00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:33.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oh, hey! I already took
a dip in the bath.

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:35.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:40.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
[exhales sharply]

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:43.130 position:16% line:89% align:start
That sure hits the spot.

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.702 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can feel all the exhaustion
washing away.

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:51.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
Christmas, New Year's Eve,
then New Year's all at once.

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:54.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think our holidays
might be way too close together.

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.977 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Yeah, maybe so.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.314 position:19% line:83% align:start
But still, after today
I feel as good as new!

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for inviting me along,
Hayakawa.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's been really nice.
-Oh, no.

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
I appreciate your company!

00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:08.022 position:13% line:89% align:start
If I planned to come alone,

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:10.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would probably just whine
about wanting to go

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.594 position:24% line:83% align:start
but never actually
make the trip.

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.796 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if I did, I wouldn't have
played in the pool much.

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd just laze around
the whole time.

00:13:17.766 --> 00:13:19.967 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
I know what you mean.

00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:23.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't remember the last time
I wore a swimsuit.

00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:25.939 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's been a while though!

00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:28.442 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not that it wasn't fun,

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:32.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I feel like I really
embarrassed myself today.

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:35.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, I need to regain my honor
as a senpai

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.418 position:16% line:89% align:start
between now and bedtime!

Aaaa!

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.028 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Whoa, what's gotten
into you?

00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:49.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
Alright, which one of you guys

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:51.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
-let Senpai have alcohol?
-Here comes the plane!

-Ah!
-No one let her have it.

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.670 position:13% line:83% align:start
But nobody didn't let her,
either.

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.404 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:59.708 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't you remember the time she

-It's Hayakawa! [kisses]

I'm incredibly grateful
for your help, sir!

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.014 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're right,
that did happen, huh?

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:08.616 position:30% line:89% align:start
Guess I forgot.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
I highly doubt that you forgot.

Oh, that's not good!
Let me take care of it for you!

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:21.629 position:10% line:83% align:start
No thanks, you don't need to!
I can do it myself!

00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:23.197 position:30% line:89% align:start
But I want to.

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:26.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
Your Senpai's here for you.

00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:30.037 position:13% line:83% align:start
From now until we go to bed
tonight, okay?

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:31.138 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:14:31.806 --> 00:14:34.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
Seriously, I don't need help
with anything!

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:37.211 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aw, do you have an upset tummy?

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:41.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Let Senpai rub it for you then!
-My tummy's fine!

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:44.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's no reason to be so shy.
It's okay.

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:47.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're like a completely
different person now!

-Show me where it hurts, kohai!
-When she's drunk...

I guess Katase

00:14:52.192 --> 00:14:53.561 position:30% line:89% align:start
She sure does.

00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:55.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
That reminds me...

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:57.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, I need to regain
my honor as a senpai

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:59.500 position:16% line:89% align:start
between now and bedtime!

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:02.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is that where all
this is coming from?

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:03.671 position:38% line:89% align:start
Could be.

00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:04.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure what she thinks

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:06.039 position:7% line:89% align:start
she has to make up for though.

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:07.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's something
on your face.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's showing that
she's here for you,

'cause she's your senpai.

Ahh.

00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:15.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, Shinozaki!

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:17.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna wipe that stuff
off your face now!

00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:19.587 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is so awkward

00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:23.424 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can barely stand it,
but I also kinda enjoy it.

00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:25.794 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hayakawa, save me!

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I have somewhere to be.

00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:30.931 position:7% line:83% align:start

here's one more bite.

Aaaa!

00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:44.746 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Man, she's really
sloshed!

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:47.181 position:38% line:83% align:start
Alright,
there's only one thing to do!

00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.416 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gulps]
Play along a little

00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
then send her off to bed
like a gentleman!

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:54.354 position:38% line:83% align:start
Good job!
Isn't it so yummy?

00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:56.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's super yummy.

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.091 position:7% line:89% align:start
And after you eat your dinner,

00:15:58.225 --> 00:15:59.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
then it's time to brush
your teeth!

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:02.162 position:41% line:83% align:start
Gaah...
Ahaa!

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:03.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I can't brush them
like this.

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:05.533 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:06.768 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get comfy, kohai!

00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:09.136 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me to lay down
on your lap?

There we go.
Does it hurt anywhere?

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.240 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:15.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, keep it together
a little longer!

00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:17.044 position:21% line:83% align:start
And once we're done,
I want you to

00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:19.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
go gargle-gargle

please tell me

you're talking about

I just want to go to bed.

If that's the case,

then you can relax

00:18:35.817 --> 00:18:39.319 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? It really is coming
from in there.

00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:41.589 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Guh! Busted.

00:18:42.023 --> 00:18:43.658 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Your Senpai heating pad!

00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:46.193 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Please, cut it out.
This isn't the time for that!

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:48.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're gonna get
the wrong idea!

00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:50.965 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, this heating pad
is the adhesive kind!

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmmm!

00:18:53.034 --> 00:18:54.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] Oh crap, oh crap...
-[SHIORI] Aren't you comfy?

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:56.104 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh crap!

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:57.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Shiori giggles]

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:59.874 position:33% line:83% align:start
Look, Senpai.
Sorry to be rude,

00:19:00.008 --> 00:19:02.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
but you have to quiet down
for a second.

00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:02.977 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:03.111 --> 00:19:04.112 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.914 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe you were just imagining
things.

00:19:07.048 --> 00:19:08.181 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I guess so.

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:09.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:11.886 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Barely avoided disaster.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.522 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Shinozaki.
-Huh?

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your hand,

00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:18.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
it's on my, um...

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.894 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:20.928 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:22.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Did you hear that?
-I did.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:28.736 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
this place does have a history.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.104 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't even go there!

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:34.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, we were having
so much fun together, and now...

00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:35.342 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shrieks]

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait, if there are ghosts here,

00:19:37.712 --> 00:19:40.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
do you think those two
got spirited away?

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:42.650 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, we can't rule it out.

00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:44.552 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] What are we gonna do?
Call the police?

00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:47.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
Call an exorcist?
Call the police and an exorcist?

00:19:47.421 --> 00:19:48.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA] Stay calm, Hayakawa!
-[Hayakawa cries]

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.158 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.761 position:33% line:83% align:start
Who is that?
Hayakawa maybe?

00:19:54.128 --> 00:19:55.697 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're here in the closet!

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.565 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wanna go to the open-air
bath too.

00:19:57.699 --> 00:19:59.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Ahh! Be quiet!

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:00.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're gonna blow our cover!

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:03.971 position:10% line:83% align:start
Come on, think of a solution!
Gah!

00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:06.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[door slides open]
-Huh? -Huh?

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:10.712 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hayakawa.
-[scream]

00:20:11.145 --> 00:20:14.448 position:10% line:83% align:start
[eerie voice] Huh? Who turned
out the lights in here?

00:20:14.582 --> 00:20:15.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Don't kill me!
Please!

00:20:16.117 --> 00:20:19.120 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Stay away!
-[AKINA] Wait for me! Hayakawa!

00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:22.590 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, I can't believe
they didn't figure us out.

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:23.524 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah?!

00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:24.992 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:26.794 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's asleep.

00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:29.797 position:13% line:89% align:start
I guess the chaos is over.

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:31.165 position:38% line:89% align:start
For now.

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:36.771 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm getting kinda tired.
Are you okay, Shinozaki?

00:20:37.138 --> 00:20:38.238 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Senpai, you'll get a
cold if you sleep there.

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.777 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's put you to bed.

00:20:42.944 --> 00:20:44.812 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:51.586 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was worried
about how she came across,

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:55.422 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I'm happy I got to see
a different side of her.

00:20:58.092 --> 00:20:59.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:01.963 position:35% line:89% align:start
Her hands.

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:05.365 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come on now.
Let me go.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.568 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't get away.

00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:10.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh boy, this might look
worse than before!

00:21:10.638 --> 00:21:12.607 position:10% line:83% align:start
[running footsteps] [panting]
[HAYAKAWA] This way!

00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:14.742 position:13% line:89% align:start
I saw a ghost in this room!

00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:15.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gaping]

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.111 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:19.580 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:24.417 position:13% line:89% align:start
Time to prepare the feast.

00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:26.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
-We've got big news, Yutaka!
-[YUTAKA] I see

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:28.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
-the wedding is on.
-Absolutely not!

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.758 position:5% line:89% align:start
[AKINA] Oh, what a glorious day!

00:21:30.892 --> 00:21:32.492 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Wait, where's the ghost?

00:21:32.627 --> 00:21:34.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] I swear it was in
here howling at me!

00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
[overlapping chatter]

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:37.598 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:40.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
This place is a lot of fun.
