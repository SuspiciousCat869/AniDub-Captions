You want to guess? [exhales]

that different about her.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:28.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
she hasn't worn that outfit
to the office before,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.571 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I doubt she'd have asked me
to guess

00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
if it was something
that obvious.

Conventional wisdom says
to check the nails first.

Huh?

Yes,

thing that I meant!

Ahh!

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.365 position:35% line:83% align:start

Now she probably thinks

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:00.735 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm a perv
for noticing her shampoo!

Wow, really?

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.605 position:7% line:83% align:start
So you've been smelling my hair
enough to know my shampoo?

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:06.574 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's not like that, Senpai!

00:05:06.707 --> 00:05:09.342 position:21% line:83% align:start
The scent just wafts
over sometimes, I promise!

my shampoo was that noticeable.

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like he's really having
a hard time with this.

00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:20.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
I should give him a push
in the right direction.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:23.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Okay, here's a hint.
-Ah?

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.961 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not just one part of me
that's different,

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:29.697 position:24% line:83% align:start
but it's something
about my whole body.

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.099 position:27% line:89% align:start
Your whole body?

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.204 position:35% line:83% align:start

As in her entire whole body?

Hm! Ah?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.373 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just told my kohai

00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:43.778 position:7% line:83% align:start
to pay an inappropriate amount
of attention to my figure!

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
I didn't know you were
into stuff like that, Senpai.

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:48.516 position:16% line:83% align:start

I'm a big pervert

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.318 position:13% line:89% align:start
for asking him to ogle me!

[BOTH whimpering]

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:55.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could you possibly
give me another hint?

00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:57.825 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course I can.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's a big difference
in our sizes,

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
so that's what
you should be focusing on.

00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:05.233 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I can't say anything more!

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:07.602 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's a size difference?

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.436 position:16% line:89% align:start
The size of what though?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.473 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is she saying that
they've gotten even bigger?

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:15.977 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get it yet?

00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:19.080 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] There is no reality
where that's the answer!

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.782 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can't. Sorry, I give up.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.416 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:25.953 position:7% line:89% align:start
Very well. I'll just tell you.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.955 position:33% line:89% align:start
The truth is.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.293 position:16% line:83% align:start
Check it out! I've gotten
a bit taller. Look, see!

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:37.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hm. So that's what it was.
Well, you do seem taller.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.902 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, that explains it.

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess, those boots do have
a bit of a heel, don't they?

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:45.873 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:49.944 position:7% line:89% align:start
My boots. I'm wearing my boots.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:53.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm just gonna sit here
for an eternity.

00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:56.449 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ahh! Maybe you're taller
in a less obvious way!

00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:59.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thanks but you don't need
to humor me.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.855 position:27% line:89% align:start
Really? You sure?

Yes, sir?

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:10.364 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIYAMA]
I know it's sudden,

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.366 position:7% line:83% align:start
but could you be a pal and take
care of something for me,

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
please?

Depends. The thing is,

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
Katase is in charge of what work
I get assigned

00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.473 position:33% line:83% align:start
so you really
should be asking her.

It's not work, it's a favor.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.045 position:7% line:89% align:start
And didn't a wise man once say,

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:26.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
"Do everything
while you're still young?!"

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.515 position:38% line:89% align:start
Then no.

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pretty please?

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:31.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I told you
I'm not the one to ask!

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.920 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Unfortunately for you,

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:35.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
we avoid taking on other
departments' busy work here.

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:38.326 position:47% line:83% align:start
Now
please stop pestering my kohai!

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.061 position:19% line:89% align:start
We were just chatting!

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:41.461 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Senpai.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.597 position:16% line:83% align:start
Say, aren't you supposed
to be in a meeting?

00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:44.832 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I see.

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
So you're just here

00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:48.035 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you assumed
that I wouldn't be around?

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:50.938 position:16% line:83% align:start
See you later, Shinozaki!
[running footsteps]

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.908 position:10% line:83% align:start
That Ishiyama never changes,
does he?

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
-He's a character.
-[computer chimes]

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.245 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh. He emailed me.

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:00.581 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIYAMA]
Wanna do it in secret?

00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:02.149 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's still no.

00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:03.483 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:04.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Bad Ishiyama! Bad! Bad! Bad!
-Ahhh!

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:06.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
Would you please stop trying
to assign work

00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:08.522 position:24% line:83% align:start
to my subordinates
behind my back!

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
What else am I supposed to do
if you won't pass it along?

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:13.961 position:33% line:83% align:start
I never said
I wouldn't help instead!

00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:15.563 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:18.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you need something,
don't ask my people.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:20.868 position:35% line:83% align:start
Come to me,
so we can do things properly.

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:23.070 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:24.338 position:38% line:89% align:start
Fowreal?

00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:26.874 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
we have things to talk about!

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:28.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Nice going, Katase.
-[SHIORI] Okay. Let's see.

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's quite the reliable senpai!

00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.079 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That's fine.

00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:33.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I'll need to adjust...
-[SHINOZAKI] Yeah.

00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:34.849 position:27% line:83% align:start
...the schedule,
but can do.

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:36.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ISHIYAMA] You just saved
my life! Thank you!

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:39.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Hey, Senpai,
what does your fortune say?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
[chuckles] It's a secret.

00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:44.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That's right, kitty.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:47.528 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's time for more
My Tiny Senpai.

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:56.070 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.540 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] I'm still not used
to being at work this late.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.976 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mm. [sighs]

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.144 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whatchadoin'?

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.612 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahhh!

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.747 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Sometimes my boss just appears.

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:08.549 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I never see it coming.
-[AKINA giggling]

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:10.151 position:13% line:83% align:start
Could you not scare me half
to death

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:12.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
by popping into existence
like that?

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.021 position:30% line:89% align:start
How rude of me!

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:17.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was just curious why you
were working so late, huh?

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
Was today that busy for you?

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:22.430 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not at first.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.265 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pretty please?

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:28.936 position:7% line:83% align:start
It was Ishiyama in PR. He asked
me to get this done by tomorrow.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.138 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] And did he get approval
from your supervisor

00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:32.206 position:30% line:89% align:start
for said help?

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.974 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-[whispers] Well, Hayakawa?

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:36.644 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know! You try saying no
to that face!

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
He approached me right
at the end of the day.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.449 position:33% line:83% align:start
He said since
it was so last minute,

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:43.217 position:10% line:89% align:start
he couldn't ask anybody else.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe so, but you shouldn't take
on assignments yourself.

00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:49.623 position:27% line:83% align:start
Especially since
you're still new here.

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.025 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just, I figured
I could do it in secret.

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Doesn't matter.

00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:56.997 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not your work

00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:59.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
and he shouldn't be taking
advantage of your kindness.

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:01.570 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:03.505 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm, ah!

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:07.641 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't forget it's a terrible
thing to do to your manager too,

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:08.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
don't you think? [chuckles]

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:10.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps] You're absolutely right.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'll be giving him a talking
to about it tomorrow.

00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:16.083 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry
to have caused you trouble.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.252 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's the one causing trouble.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.387 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[HAYAKAWA] Thank you.
-Ah!

00:10:20.522 --> 00:10:22.456 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:24.325 position:24% line:89% align:start
I do appreciate it.

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.093 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear!

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:28.563 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please don't cry!
I'm just doing my job, really!

00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:30.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
-No cry! No more cry!
-I'm sorry.

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess it just makes me
really happy

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.270 position:7% line:83% align:start
to know I have someone looking
out for me at work.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's such a relief,
I got overwhelmed.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
Excuse me a second.

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.412 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:47.214 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wow, thank you for the tea.

00:10:47.348 --> 00:10:49.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[HAYAKAWA stomach growls]
-Oh!

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.786 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have you not had dinner yet?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.156 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was gonna eat
when I finished working.

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:57.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] How much longer
do you think you'll be?

00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:59.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm done.
I just need to submit it.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.995 position:10% line:89% align:start
Perfect! If you're up for it,

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.632 position:7% line:83% align:start
we can go grab something to eat
before you head home then!

00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:05.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh! You sure?

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:10.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
Consider it a reward
for being such a hard worker.

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.039 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:13.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[AKINA giggles]
-[HAYAKAWA] Seriously,

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.944 position:7% line:83% align:start
how can he say that kinda stuff
with a straight face?

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
[gasps] The place looked
so modern outside.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:24.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wasn't expecting this.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] It's quite the surprise,
isn't it?

00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:28.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the kinda view
you can get lost in.

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:30.157 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:31.660 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Why did he just sit next to me

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:33.360 position:21% line:83% align:start
like it was the most
normal thing?

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:36.897 position:7% line:83% align:start
What's going on? Is he pulling
some kind of move on me?

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:38.365 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKINA laughs]

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:41.368 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
[chuckles] Non-alcoholic drinks!

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:44.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am definitely coming back here
so I can try them all.

00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:46.273 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you like it.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:49.176 position:13% line:83% align:start
I noticed you rarely drink
at office parties.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.879 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I thought you would
appreciate the menu here.

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:55.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] Is he trying
to be the perfect man?

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:58.986 position:7% line:83% align:start
So how many women at the office
have asked you out?

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.288 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not very many, honestly.

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:04.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] At the very least,
it's happened twice then.

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:09.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Manager? Why don't you
talk about your love life?

00:12:09.631 --> 00:12:13.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Because nobody
wanted to know about it.

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:15.269 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.104 position:27% line:89% align:start
If I asked you...

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:20.407 position:27% line:83% align:start
would you be okay
talking about it?

00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:23.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
You want to know?

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.412 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, I didn't mean it
like that!

00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:30.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
Didn't mean it how?

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:33.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] How can he be
so smart yet so oblivious?

00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:36.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's not much to tell.

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
When I was a kid,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.729 position:13% line:83% align:start
I never really got how you
were supposed to feel

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
if you liked someone.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:44.999 position:13% line:83% align:start
I tried dating all through
school and a bit in college.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:46.568 position:30% line:89% align:start
But in the end,

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:49.136 position:10% line:83% align:start
that feeling wasn't something
I ever figured out.

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:51.272 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I'm okay with it.

00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:54.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think romance isn't
in the cards for me, as it were.

[HAYAKAWA]
So that's why you care so much.

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:00.649 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, the thing is.

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:01.949 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.218 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nothing in the world brings me
more joy

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.655 position:27% line:83% align:start
than cheering on
someone else's love life.

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:09.390 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:13:09.524 --> 00:13:11.760 position:33% line:83% align:start
Enough of me.
Now what's your story,

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:14.395 position:44% line:83% align:start
-huh?
-What? Not me, I'm boring!

00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:16.797 position:30% line:83% align:start
That face makes
it hard to believe you!

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.265 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
Ah-ha.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:20.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought I recognized
the voices over here.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.069 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Yutaka!

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:24.338 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is your office around here too?

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:28.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes. In the opposite direction
of the station from this area.

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:31.145 position:13% line:83% align:start
Some co-workers brought me
this way.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
I am not one for big groups.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.883 position:35% line:83% align:start
I absconded
at the first chance I had.

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:38.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now I find myself
very lonely.

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:40.154 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKINA, HAYAKAWA]
That tracks.

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:42.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
Given my current state, would it
be all right for me to join you?

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:44.391 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Absolutely!

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.795 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please pardon the intrusion.

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.195 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.497 position:16% line:83% align:start

-[HAYAKAWA] Come on,

00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:52.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's no reason
to be anxious about anything!

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
That seat is no different

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:55.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
than any of the others
she could've taken.

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:58.606 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Nary a one.
-[HAYAKAWA] No different.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.108 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
That's not normal.

00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.409 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think I'll sit here now.

00:14:04.546 --> 00:14:07.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just sit across from me
like a normal person!

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:09.083 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm good.

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:10.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those eyes told me
that I should sit here.

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.152 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whose eyes were those eyes?

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:13.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why, yours, of course.

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:15.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
-My eyes said nothing!
-They disagree.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.157 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Idea!

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:21.629 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, it's true. She didn't want
to sit next to me after all.

00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:23.832 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:26.166 position:10% line:89% align:start
You really mean that, Yutaka?

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:29.169 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
I can sit across from you.

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:31.271 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I think you should stay
where you were.

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:33.575 position:35% line:83% align:start
No, please.
The spot is all yours.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:34.975 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, you sit.

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:35.976 position:35% line:83% align:start

Whatcha guys doin' over there?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.911 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No, you!
-Hayakawa?

00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:39.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Chika.

00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:42.416 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] If I'm in the way,
I can head on home.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.885 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:47.756 position:7% line:83% align:start
You two can sit right where you
are for the rest of the night!

Unbelievable.

knocking them back!

-You're a big drinker!

It's non-alcoholic!

00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:56.564 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
Then why are you so red?

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.808 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Why does my body feel so heavy?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.976 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is this sleep paralysis?

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:12.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
Li'l brother, gimme
all your Shiorin pics now.

Begone, sleep demon!

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:16.250 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you have anything
better to do

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:19.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
than break into my apartment
and wake me up on my day off?

00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:21.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
Also, you want pics?

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.992 position:10% line:83% align:start
Correct. Shiorin's fluffiness
won't leave my mind.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:26.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I need some pictures

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:28.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
so that I can air-fluff her
at any moment!

00:15:28.696 --> 00:15:30.431 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's not a good reason.

00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:33.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
And do I want to know what
you're doing with your hands?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.702 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
I'm air-fluffing.

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:37.505 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yes. I approve of this.
-[SHINOZAKI] Oh, that.

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, even if I wanted
to help you out,

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:41.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't have any pictures.

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
Then get some.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'd be a lot better off
asking Hayakawa.

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your manager suggested
that I ask you.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:50.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since when are you
on texting terms with my boss?

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:52.921 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
You're right, though.

00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:56.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
We could, um, try them on.

00:15:56.558 --> 00:15:58.793 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was just thinking we could
send each other pictures,

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:00.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the loungewear, I mean!

[SHINOZAKI]
I forgot,

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:04.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
we never did end up
exchanging photos of ourselves

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.233 position:16% line:89% align:start
in those outfits we got.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:09.804 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I can't deny
I'd like to see that.

-Yoink!
-There, sent the message!

Hm?

Ah!

Here's him with a cat.

Oh!

00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:40.822 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA] Here he is running.
Eating sushi.

Stretching.

[SHIORI]
She's totally spamming me

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:45.459 position:13% line:89% align:start
with pictures of Shinozaki!

Here's one of him bathing.

Wait! Not that one!

If he's in the bath then doesn't
that mean he's, n-naked?

Age 3.

[sighs] Man, that was awful.

The worst part is, Senpai
never texted me back.

-[SHIORI] Shinozaki?
-Hm?

Good morning. I hope
you're ready for an awesome day!

Oh, good morning to you, Senpai.
Didn't see you there!

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:20.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
By the way, sorry for
what my sister did yesterday.

It's all right.

00:19:22.697 --> 00:19:25.933 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] So, um, about that
picture you mentioned.

Huh?

I would be happy to receive one!

Ah?

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:35.409 position:35% line:83% align:start

I said it! I really said it!

There's no turning back now!

To tell you the truth,

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's something kind
of embarrassing

00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:48.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
about taking a picture
of yourself.

Ah-ah. She's changing her mind?

00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:52.593 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did I freak her out somehow?

00:19:52.727 --> 00:19:54.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI] That's why...
-Ah!

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:58.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
...I'd much rather
we take one together!

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.703 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like just the two of us?

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:02.970 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:20:03.104 --> 00:20:04.739 position:7% line:83% align:start
That way, it won't be a picture
of me by myself.

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:07.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
It'll be a whole lot better
if it has you in it, too!

00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:08.910 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:20:09.043 --> 00:20:10.678 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Great idea!
-It's you!

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:12.013 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not again!

Okay!

a little bit closer to Katase?

Ah!

Trust me, there is!

[SHIORI] What's the matter?
Are you feeling nervous?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.496 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kinda.

-Huh?

Well, if I'm being honest,

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:37.739 position:41% line:83% align:start
I guess
I'm a little nervous too.

00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:40.340 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Does that mean?

Here we go!

It turned out really nice,
thank you!

I took a photo with Senpai

standing right next to me!

what are you guys doing in here?

take a nice photo together!

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.296 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why, though?

And you get in here, too,

Ah!

without me?

Ah!
