00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:12.647 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.151 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, it's kinda cramped in here,
isn't it?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.854 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:23.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
On the bright side,
they haven't noticed us.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.532 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
How in the world

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
did Senpai and I wind up
in such a sticky situation?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[YOSHIDA] Smooch!
-[ITO] Smooch!

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] This is
not at all how I thought

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.197 position:24% line:89% align:start
today was gonna go.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
So why do you need
old Meowtaro merchandise?

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know, Meowtaro's big day!

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:18.773 position:16% line:83% align:start
The company's putting it
together

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
to celebrate Meowtaro's
thirtieth anniversary.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:23.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
Could you go down
to the basement

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.145 position:33% line:83% align:start
and grab some
out of storage please?

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.814 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sure, I don't mind.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.883 position:10% line:89% align:start
Katase, why don't you go too.

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:30.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
He might need some help.

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:33.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can absolutely
count on us, sir!

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.024 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Hmm. Any luck?

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.393 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Uh, not yet, unfortunately.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm starting to think it
might've all been thrown out.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.134 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI] Ah!
-Y'find it?

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, but I did find
a Meowtaro pen case

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:51.171 position:24% line:83% align:start
that's exactly like
the one I used to have.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.707 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
This place is a treasure trove

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
for any old-school
Meowtaro fans.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.644 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should probably
finish looking

00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:58.345 position:30% line:83% align:start
before we spend
the whole day down here.

-[phone blinks]
-Huh?

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:02.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's from the manager
on the office group chat.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.753 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] It should be on one
of the shelves in the back.

00:03:06.054 --> 00:03:07.354 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-The back?

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.092 position:33% line:83% align:start
We did check
most everything around here.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess it's time
to head further in.

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.394 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Right.

[HAYAKAWA] Why is your face
doing that thing again?

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:21.468 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:22.870 position:41% line:83% align:start

I'm sensing something

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.839 position:30% line:83% align:start
sacchariferous
is about to happen.

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:26.206 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:31.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
We still have so much more
to go through.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.481 position:33% line:83% align:start
Got any idea
where we should start?

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.084 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's the question.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll start bringing down
the boxes

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:39.352 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the upper shelves
and we'll go from there.

[door rattling]

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:41.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:43.858 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ITO]
You sure it's safe?

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:46.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIDA] I promise.
No one ever comes down here.

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.896 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shinozaki quick, come and see.

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:51.398 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:52.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ITO] But what if someone
walks in on us?

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:55.136 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIDA] We'll cross
that bridge if we get to it.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.370 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hey,
isn't that Ito from PR?

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:58.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
-And that's Yoshida.
-I swear.

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
What would PR need
from the basement?

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:03.845 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Could it be?
-Could it what?

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't want to
speak out of turn but...

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.616 position:30% line:89% align:start
How would you?

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:10.585 position:35% line:89% align:start
Teddy Bear!

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:12.854 position:38% line:89% align:start

-It's a real-life,

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:18.458 position:30% line:89% align:start

Masa,
you're such a naughty boy.

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:22.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
Only because you bring it
out in me.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:25.432 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggle]
But we are at work.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] She took
the words out of my mouth!

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:29.570 position:7% line:89% align:start
So the office gossip was true.

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:31.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
I never would've thought.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.474 position:33% line:83% align:start
I mean, wow.
They're really together.

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:36.043 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
And you're really staring!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm getting nervous
being so close to the door.

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:41.249 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does the thought
of getting caught excite you?

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.984 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ITO]
You're so bad.

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:44.585 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] What
if you've already been caught?

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:46.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
Better safe than sorry.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.223 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we're gonna have fun,
we should do it further back.

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:53.027 position:33% line:83% align:start
[both panic]
-Oh, come on!

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.461 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are we gonna do, Senpai?

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:55.730 position:21% line:83% align:start
They'll be back here
any second now!

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.497 position:41% line:83% align:start
Senpai,
they're coming this way!

00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:58.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's not panic! All we need
is someplace to hide.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.300 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:06.439 position:30% line:89% align:start

-[ITO] Smooch!

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:23.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Well, at least
we found a place to hide.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, it's kinda cramped
in here, isn't it?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.362 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:32.967 position:24% line:83% align:start
On the bright side,
they haven't noticed us.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although they have been
going at it for a while now.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hopefully, they don't move
on to anything more involved.

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:42.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doubt it. I can't imagine
they'd do that in the office.

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.680 position:13% line:83% align:start
Still, we might be in here
for a while.

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.816 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, if I get all sweaty

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I start to smell bad

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm really sorry about that.

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:54.188 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, it's okay.

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:57.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't really mind it
because I know that it's yours.

00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Oh! What's that
supposed to mean, Senpai?

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.162 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.730 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:07.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Yep, that's
definitely Senpai's bust!

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.070 position:10% line:89% align:start
Pushing right up against me!

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:11.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
Senpai, I'm so sorry.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:14.108 position:16% line:83% align:start

so no harm done.

We need to get out of here soon

00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:26.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
'cause I can't take
much more of this!

Can someone please
hose those two down?

There's gotta be a way
to get them out of here!

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Senpai!
I think I have an idea.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, let's hear it.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
We can use the office
group chat to lure them away!

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:47.174 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where'd you guys go?

It's perfect. Right, Senpai?

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:55.716 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:57.952 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.788 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a small snag
in your plan.

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:03.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
Normally, it wouldn't be
a big deal, but uh.

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:06.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
I put my phone away
in my back pocket.

Ah!

00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:11.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna need your help
to get it.

Oh, sure.

It'll be fine.

00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:20.041 position:7% line:83% align:start
All I gotta do is reach around
and grab it.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:23.744 position:30% line:89% align:start
With my hands.

00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:26.547 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense music]

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:29.750 position:38% line:89% align:start
New snag.

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.854 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is it okay if I adjust a bit?

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:36.757 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll be careful
not to make too much noise.

[SHIORI]
Sure.

to be embarrassed.

Katase wants us back.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.921 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! We need to hurry

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:09.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
before she realizes
that we've been slacking off!

that's finally over.

Yup, we're free at last.

Huh?

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.211 position:21% line:89% align:start
This looks familiar.

It's the Meowtaro merch
we've been looking for!

-All right!
-All right!

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:37.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess getting trapped
had a bright side!

-Ah.
-Uh.

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.392 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, we should be heading back
ourselves now.

The vibes!

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:54.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sensing shenanigans.

You good?

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.737 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Preciousness can be detected

00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:58.539 position:21% line:89% align:start
with the sixth sense.

before you know it.

As expected

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.194 position:33% line:83% align:start
I didn't get

00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:11.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] Those two have
been acting strangely

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:13.347 position:24% line:83% align:start
since they got back
from the basement.

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is it possible there've been
some new developments

00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:19.086 position:27% line:83% align:start
between them that
they want to keep secret?

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.956 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.295 position:19% line:83% align:start

I didn't get much sleep again.

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:29.697 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good, you're up.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
So what's this new thing
with you and Shiori?

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't you have a job
to get ready for or something?

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:37.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
Chihiro told me that there
have been some developments.

00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:39.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
Would you care to tell me
how long

00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.675 position:10% line:83% align:start
you've been exchanging intel
with my manager?

00:10:41.809 --> 00:10:43.512 position:21% line:83% align:start
And for that matter,
since when exactly

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
did you start calling him
Chihiro?

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:49.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look, nothing is going on
between me and Senpai.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.986 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[sniffing]
-Please, stop that.

00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:54.455 position:7% line:89% align:start
I smell eau de Shiorin on you.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:55.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:10:56.023 --> 00:10:57.526 position:13% line:89% align:start
For it to be so noticeable,

00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:00.327 position:16% line:83% align:start
you two must have spent a
lot of time in close proximity.

00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:03.063 position:7% line:89% align:start
Therefore, I can only conclude

00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:05.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you two were trapped
together in a closet or locker.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.301 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
How does she do that?

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.239 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Thanks, sis.

00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:13.941 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was trying to
forget about it,

00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:15.976 position:33% line:83% align:start
but now it's
all I can think about.

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:19.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like my brain is stuck
in a loop.

00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:21.282 position:16% line:89% align:start
And now I'm just anxious.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:23.684 position:19% line:89% align:start
I gotta deal with this.

00:11:27.522 --> 00:11:30.491 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.
Today's the day I tell her.

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.627 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI] Hey, Shinozaki?
-Yes?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.728 position:7% line:89% align:start
A delivery just came in for us.

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:36.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mind coming with me
to general affairs

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:37.698 position:27% line:89% align:start
to help with it?

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.500 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sure, no problem.

00:11:39.634 --> 00:11:41.936 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh. Is there something wrong?

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:43.904 position:27% line:89% align:start
No. It's nothing.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.006 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.915 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] She's not acting
like anything

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:56.417 position:16% line:89% align:start
is different between us.

00:11:57.351 --> 00:12:00.221 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe for her, what happened
was just an accident.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.326 position:30% line:83% align:start
But then, maybe
I'm not seeing something.

00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:09.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maybe she feels
the same way as me.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.838 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hold on.
-Huh?

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:21.775 position:10% line:83% align:start
Senpai, may I speak with you
after work?

00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:23.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:27.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's something I'd like
to discuss with you privately.

00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:32.119 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, no problem.

00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:36.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] It blows my
mind how cute Meowtaro is.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:38.259 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know. I am like,

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:40.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
completely addicted to
how floppy his ears are.

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.363 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a great way to put it.

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:44.965 position:13% line:83% align:start
No wonder he's been around
for thirty years.

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:48.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] He must have
something important to tell me.

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:51.438 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why else would he want
to talk privately?

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.575 position:27% line:89% align:start
What could it be?

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.543 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's that important?

00:12:58.713 --> 00:12:59.980 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry for the wait.

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:02.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
You wanted to talk to me?

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.055 position:41% line:89% align:start
Senpai.

00:13:09.624 --> 00:13:10.858 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:15.796 position:19% line:83% align:start
I love you and I really
want to be your boyfriend!

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.831 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aaah!

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.166 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That is a massively

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
gigantic-sized
conclusion to jump to!

00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:23.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's probably something
way more innocent

00:13:23.404 --> 00:13:26.541 position:13% line:83% align:start
like needing work advice or
help with a personal problem.

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:28.842 position:38% line:89% align:start
But then

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:32.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
what if that is what
he wants to talk to me about?

00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:36.016 position:27% line:89% align:start
What would I do?

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] Katase, have
you heard the latest gossip?

00:13:39.788 --> 00:13:41.121 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.924 position:16% line:83% align:start
Apparently, Yoshida in PR
is getting reassigned.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:46.493 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Huh? What happened?

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:48.797 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] The story
is that he got caught

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:51.599 position:10% line:83% align:start
fooling around with Ito while
they were both on the clock.

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:54.068 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's true,
a ton of people saw them.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:57.037 position:10% line:83% align:start
They were so into each other
they didn't notice.

00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:01.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
Isn't that kinda
what usually happens

00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:03.210 position:27% line:83% align:start
when people have
an office romance?

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:05.913 position:41% line:83% align:start
It can.
This time it's mostly because

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.282 position:30% line:83% align:start
they basically
stopped doing any work.

00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:10.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:14.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
Reassignment.

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:18.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, I admit,
it did come as a shock.

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:21.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
Those two were always
so cool and together,

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
I figured they were
on top of things.

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:25.466 position:35% line:89% align:start
Then again.

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:28.035 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[YOSHIDA] Hold me, my love!
-[ITO] I'll never let go!

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:29.236 position:38% line:83% align:start

Neither will I.

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:32.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
It happens. A girlfriend
can really change a man.

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.141 position:27% line:89% align:start
That is so true.

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.176 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
that's a real thing?

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:38.245 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, and it's super common.

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:40.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
Some guys end up acting
all cool.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.217 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Oh, this thing? She's my chick.

00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:46.186 position:27% line:83% align:start
Think she's cute?
Nah, she's average.

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:49.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] Some guys
will white knight too hard.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.091 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Back off. I better not see you

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
look at her or we're going to
have a problem.

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:55.262 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:57.464 --> 00:14:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and it's always
the quiet, down-to-earth ones

00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:02.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
who totally lose it
when they get a girlfriend.

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.671 position:13% line:89% align:start
The worst ones are the guys

00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:06.240 position:27% line:83% align:start
who go full baby
the second they start dating.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:07.575 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's that bad?

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's super weird.

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:11.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's all baby voice
and head pats.

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:14.915 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Senpai, I'm so sleepy.

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.950 position:19% line:89% align:start
Gimme headpats please?

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:19.554 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, you have been a good boy.

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.188 position:13% line:89% align:start
I guess you've earned one.

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:22.891 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Oh, that's cute.

00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:25.058 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
that's the worst thing

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:26.528 position:21% line:89% align:start
a guy can do, is it?

00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:28.061 position:19% line:89% align:start
It could be kinda cute.

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:29.764 position:7% line:89% align:start
To you. But then you've always

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:31.533 position:7% line:89% align:start
had a bit of a shot a-con vibe.

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:36.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait? But I, that's not. No.

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:38.005 position:19% line:89% align:start
I-I-I... I didn't mean.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
Speaking of types,
what's yours, Hayakawa?

00:15:40.508 --> 00:15:43.812 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, well, well, you know.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:45.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
I like guys who are sweet,

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:47.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
hardworking and reliable
so I can trust them

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:50.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
to always look out for me
and never judge my hobbies.

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
What you just described
doesn't exist.

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:54.254 position:33% line:89% align:start
Best move on.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.892 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ITO]
Mind if I chime in?

00:15:58.459 --> 00:15:59.594 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
Ito, what's up?

00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:02.730 position:27% line:83% align:start
I agree with you
that women can change men.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.364 position:38% line:89% align:start
However.

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:07.735 position:24% line:83% align:start
The reverse is also
just as true.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.771 position:44% line:83% align:start
[All]
Ah!

There you are!

00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:13.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, this is where
you've been hiding, Honeybee.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:15.175 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, Masa!

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:19.112 position:16% line:83% align:start
Forgive me! I never meant
to abandon you like that!

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.481 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ITO]
There's no need!

00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:23.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
Absence only makes
the heart grow fonder.

00:16:23.818 --> 00:16:25.052 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so?

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.120 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIDA]
I do, with all my heart.

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.256 position:38% line:83% align:start

They've lost their minds.

They went full idiot.

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:42.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like a car wreck.
I can't not look.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.209 position:13% line:89% align:start
I had to get out of there.

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
Things were getting
too spicy for me.

Is that what it's like
for everyone?

00:16:57.886 --> 00:16:59.353 position:21% line:89% align:start
Would we be the same?

[SHINOZAKI]
Forgive me!

Don't you think so?

I do with all my heart.

Ah!

00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.676 position:27% line:83% align:start

I don't want to turn

into a brain-dead idiot.

I think it's wonderful
to have a relationship

Hey,
we all have to start somewhere.

Oh, wow.

Huh?

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.098 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think it's safe for you

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:38.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
to put the business card
away now.

Yes. Right.

Finding the right time to do it

is a skill in itself,
am I right?

It really is, isn't it?

something you can do?

You do know you need
that to transform, right.

00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:13.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
while I was running.

00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:15.670 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not a phone!

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:18.506 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey. Bad guys!

00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:20.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
What awful timing!

00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:21.709 position:19% line:89% align:start
Crime waits for no one!

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.044 position:41% line:89% align:start
But I.

00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:24.712 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Here you go.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:27.882 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's an old one
but it'll do for now.

00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:30.218 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
It's not that model, is it?

00:22:31.252 --> 00:22:33.654 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] There's no time
and we're out of options!

00:22:37.424 --> 00:22:38.960 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hold it right there!

00:22:39.694 --> 00:22:42.797 position:13% line:83% align:start
[laughs] So, we meet again,
Magical Girl--

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.464 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:46.701 position:33% line:83% align:start
What happened
to your old uniform?

00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:48.603 position:13% line:89% align:start
I had a bit of an accident.

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:51.371 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm using
an old transformation compact.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.674 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
The old days were spicy!

00:22:54.175 --> 00:22:56.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, defeating you when
you're not at your best

00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:57.444 position:21% line:89% align:start
wouldn't be the same.

00:22:57.578 --> 00:22:59.379 position:7% line:89% align:start
So how about we call it a day?

00:22:59.547 --> 00:23:01.148 position:16% line:89% align:start
I would appreciate that.

00:23:01.649 --> 00:23:03.050 position:7% line:89% align:start
And thank you. I'll do better.

00:23:03.184 --> 00:23:05.119 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
It appears this old Demon Lord

00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:06.854 position:13% line:89% align:start
still has some work to do.

00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:09.657 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
To be continued!
