would you like to go do
something naughty?

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.393 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just us two?

One of my superiors at work

is so small and sexy--

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.069 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean cute!

after a few late-night drinks
I can't say no.

-Are you not hungry?
-I'm good.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.595 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just wasn't expecting us
to get ramen.

Don't be silly, you worked
so hard for the contest.

I know that it's not much,

about how having
late-night ramen cravings

he really likes fish, right?

Yeah, that makes sense!

that. -Wait, what?

He can have fish
anytime he wants to.

Well, maybe if we knew
his entire backstory!

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
The optimal choice here
is fruit!

What are these
bold flavors?

00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:44.772 position:13% line:89% align:start
Of course! I would love to!

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, please let me
try the game out!

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:48.309 position:30% line:83% align:start
Keep teasing me
and see what happens.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.543 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Here, check it out.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.212 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill it.

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't yuck it just because
it's not your yum!

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:58.052 position:7% line:83% align:start
This innovation is gonna let us
tap into the otome game market!

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.419 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
Meowtaro?

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hot? This is sacrilege,
I tell you!

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.
I won't have it!

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
That isn't innovation,
it's pandering.

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:10.364 position:7% line:83% align:start
It lacks even the basic tenets
of Meowtaro's appeal.

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:13.401 position:13% line:83% align:start
If this ever gets released
it will disgust our fans,

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:14.635 position:24% line:89% align:start
not make new ones.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.137 position:47% line:83% align:start
So,
this is just a fool's errand!

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.373 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then how, pray tell, do you
expect to make new fans

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:20.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
if we're stuck appeasing
to the old ones

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:22.442 position:10% line:89% align:start
by never doing anything new?

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:23.911 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's your methodology.

00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.846 position:7% line:83% align:start
Listen up, your game is better
off as a new, distinct IP.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.115 position:41% line:83% align:start
Anyway,
let's get back to the game.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.985 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry,
but we need to talk

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.421 position:41% line:83% align:start
before
the festival's over.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:36.489 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh! Do we get
the post-festival confession?

00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:37.658 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
This feels too soon
to be the ending.

00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:42.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then why are having
a private rooftop meetup?

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.497 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
A private meeting.

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:46.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
On the rooftop.

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.005 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
That sounds familiar.

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:55.409 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen, I never want
our relationship to change.

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.278 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Wait a second.

00:07:58.012 --> 00:07:59.513 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Where have I heard that?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, it's great
how we're such good coworkers

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:03.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I don't want
that to change.

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.485 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Now it's getting weird!

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.088 position:21% line:89% align:start
Aw, man, that sucks.

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:09.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
We got rejected before
we could even confess.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.825 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you sure though?

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:14.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not right.

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.064 position:19% line:89% align:start
But it does make sense.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.166 position:24% line:89% align:start
That would mean...

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:21.202 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I rejected him?

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was the last thing
I wanted to do!

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if he was going to
confess to me that night,

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.341 position:35% line:83% align:start
of course,
he'd see it that way!

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.143 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I got rejected?

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:30.845 position:16% line:89% align:start
So that is what happened!

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:32.513 position:19% line:83% align:start
All I wanted to do was
forget that night

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.548 position:30% line:83% align:start
ever happened,
not think about it more!

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:36.250 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both crying]

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:37.885 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm missing something.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.588 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hold it right there.

00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:42.690 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's too soon
to be giving up on love.

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.492 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know you figured it out.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.626 position:27% line:89% align:start
You said as much.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.062 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
The story can't end here.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:49.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
You haven't confessed yet.

00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:51.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's still a chance
to seal the deal

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.835 position:13% line:83% align:start
but you've got to get back
out there and take it!

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
Or do you mean to tell me

00:08:57.338 --> 00:08:59.573 position:10% line:83% align:start
that you don't love Meowtaro
as much as you claim?

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.609 position:35% line:83% align:start
Personally,
I've never claimed that.

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:04.245 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I haven't confessed.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.580 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Our story isn't over.

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:09.116 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I still have a chance!

00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:11.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
We can't give up yet!

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're totally right.
This quest isn't over!

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:16.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can still have
a happy ending!

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay, is there a reason
you guys are so into this?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.296 position:33% line:83% align:start
How Pathetic.
That is not Meowtaro.

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:25.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] That game
was a lot of fun, wasn't it?

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.401 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It sure was.

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:30.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
For a second, I was scared
they wouldn't end up together.

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:31.972 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Me too.
-Hmm.

-[SHIORI] Hey, Shinozaki.
-Hmm?

00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:38.646 position:27% line:83% align:start
What was it that
you wanted to tell me

00:09:39.548 --> 00:09:40.915 position:24% line:89% align:start
when we got ramen?

00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:45.953 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:09:49.524 --> 00:09:51.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I was wondering
about our future.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:56.897 position:13% line:83% align:start
Will we only ever be senpai
and kohai or something more.

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.066 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.341 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is a fair question.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.643 position:27% line:83% align:start
Especially since
I told you that I think

00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:12.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
we should always just be
good coworkers.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.615 position:24% line:89% align:start
But you know what?

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:16.283 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:18.786 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thoughts can change.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:21.288 position:38% line:83% align:start
So maybe
our relationship can too.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.624 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:27.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's fine. I think.

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:31.065 position:13% line:89% align:start
If it's all right with you.

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:34.368 position:7% line:89% align:start

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:41.142 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:46.615 position:10% line:89% align:start

more time together
outside of work?

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:50.217 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:52.820 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.022 position:19% line:83% align:start

sometimes?

-And what about

if it's something

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.961 position:21% line:89% align:start
two friends would do!

00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:03.164 position:38% line:83% align:start
Like um,
me sending you a text

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
asking if you're busy
for no reason!

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.735 position:19% line:83% align:start
That'd be totally fine
because we're friends!

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
We could even send each other
selfies in our new outfits.

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.873 position:41% line:83% align:start
I mean,
that sounds completely natural

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:14.475 position:10% line:89% align:start
for two normal friends to do!

Great, I'll confirm it then.

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.847 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] We're more than
just senpai and kohai.

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:30.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] We've got a whole
world of friendship to explore.

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.219 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Except...

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.121 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
When I think about it.

00:12:34.455 --> 00:12:37.057 position:27% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] Everything
is basically the same!

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:38.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I want to do
something outside of work

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:40.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
with her, but I can't
figure out when to ask!

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:43.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I bought new clothes
and even took selfies in them,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I can't think of would it
be appropriate to send them!

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:47.234 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I've never practiced

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:48.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
asking female friends
to hang out!

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:50.337 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I've never had a guy friend,

00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:52.273 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I've never had
to think about this stuff!

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.642 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Someone, please tell me

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:55.142 position:16% line:89% align:start
what I'm supposed to do!

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:57.878 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I have zero clue
how to move forward here!

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.682 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
If only there was...

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:02.517 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Something to act on.

00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:03.984 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:07.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] One tiny thing
to spur us along!

00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:11.892 position:47% line:83% align:start
Aw.
So, you didn't like Okinawa?

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.494 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
That's an understatement!

00:13:13.628 --> 00:13:15.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everywhere I turned,
it was just people going at it

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.565 position:7% line:83% align:start
-like the world was gonna end.
-Katase,

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:20.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
are you sure it's fine
if I sit here with you?

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:22.069 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah! In fact, I think

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:24.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
we should get together
for lunch more often.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh! that would be nice,
thank you.

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:28.942 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I don't want to wait around

00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:30.578 position:19% line:89% align:start
for something to happen

00:13:30.712 --> 00:13:32.146 position:10% line:89% align:start
but I'm not sure what to do.

00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:35.282 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Nothing will change
if I don't do anything

00:13:35.517 --> 00:13:37.217 position:16% line:89% align:start
but what's my next move?

00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:39.754 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
What's the timing?

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
So there were snags.
It's Okinawa.

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.326 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it wasn't all bad.

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
Guess it had its moments.

00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:49.029 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, well.

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.699 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's still Golden Week.

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:52.600 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd like to go somewhere fun.

00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you guys have
holiday plans yet?

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:57.204 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
This is it!

00:13:58.272 --> 00:13:59.674 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing planned for me!

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:01.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, not yet.

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.110 position:21% line:83% align:start
It sure would be nice
to go out with friends

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.312 position:38% line:83% align:start
for some
friend activities.

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.315 position:33% line:83% align:start
Same for me.
Nothing planned yet,

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
but those friend activities
sound like they would be fun.

00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:14.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] Now everyone knows
I'm free that week.

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.990 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm not doing jack, either.

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.093 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I've got something.

00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:21.596 position:35% line:83% align:start
Every year
an old high school buddy

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I go to a theme park.

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:24.231 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
That could be fun!

00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:26.668 position:30% line:83% align:start
We always wear
matching outfits.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Matching outfits
with Shinozaki.

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:31.573 position:38% line:89% align:start
So cute!

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:34.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
And we get merch
to commemorate the trip.

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:37.077 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Commemorative merch.

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.046 position:38% line:89% align:start
So nice!

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:42.082 position:21% line:83% align:start
Going to a theme park
sounds awesome.

00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:45.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like a pilgrimage
to a friendship utopia.

00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:46.821 position:33% line:89% align:start
Do you think?

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.123 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's full of kids
this time of year though,

00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:52.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
but my friend and I are
doing the full park experience.

00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:53.795 position:33% line:89% align:start
So, get this.

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:55.262 position:19% line:89% align:start
We got ourselves a big,

00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.498 position:35% line:83% align:start
swanky room
at the park's hotel!

00:14:58.031 --> 00:14:59.601 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
What? A hotel room?

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:01.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
And there's even
a private lounge bar

00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:03.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you can drink
and take in the view.

00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:07.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] A drink
in a private lounge bar.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.977 position:30% line:89% align:start
This was nice.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:13.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here's looking at you,
Senpai-kid.

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:16.083 position:35% line:89% align:start
[blushing]

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.652 position:33% line:83% align:start
After drinks,
we'll sit on the bed

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:19.253 position:19% line:89% align:start
and talk about the day.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.355 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
On the bed.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.425 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whaddya think?

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad we did this,
aren't you?

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:29.430 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:30.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
And the best part,

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:33.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
the room has its own
open-air bath!

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both gasping]

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.071 position:21% line:89% align:start
[BOTH] So, both of us

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
in a bath together?

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:43.076 position:16% line:89% align:start
And then there's day two!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.646 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI, SHINOZAKI] Yamagishi!
-Huh?

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:46.581 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a little unsavory

00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:48.315 position:10% line:83% align:start
for a trip with your friend,
don't you think?

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:51.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you sure that bathing
is a normal friend activity?

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI] It seems
like a normal thing to me.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.322 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you think
you'd be moving too fast?

00:15:55.456 --> 00:15:57.958 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe wait until
your relationship's matured!

00:15:58.091 --> 00:15:59.226 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
You guys think so?

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.562 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

00:16:00.695 --> 00:16:03.063 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, I think
I know what's going on.

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:05.499 position:21% line:83% align:start
You two are shy about
bathing with others, huh?

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.034 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both gasping]

00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:08.969 position:35% line:89% align:start
[blushing]

00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:10.971 position:35% line:89% align:start
[blushing]

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.441 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't say
that I'm embarrassed, per se.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:17.444 position:38% line:83% align:start
Honestly,
it sounds like it'd be great.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.381 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I've known her for years
so we should be fine.

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:23.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
Spending the whole day
with an old friend.

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:25.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
That sounds like
it could be lots of fun.

00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:28.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] The hotel
was a bit of a surprise

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:29.824 position:16% line:89% align:start
but going to a theme park

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.092 position:16% line:83% align:start
sounds like it could make
for a really nice day.

00:16:32.927 --> 00:16:35.429 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] It's definitely way
too soon to go to a hotel,

00:16:35.563 --> 00:16:38.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
but a theme park
sounds like it'd be perfect.

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
All this talk has me
wanting to go myself.

00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:44.104 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, me too! Let's do it.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[KURUSU] You mustn't.
-Hmm?

00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:49.409 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU] Theme parks feature
characters from other brands.

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:51.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
Money we earn from Meowtaro

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:54.816 position:30% line:83% align:start
cannot be spent
on competitors, ever.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you saying
you're not into theme parks?

00:16:58.786 --> 00:16:59.787 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
That's not it.

00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:02.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
I plan to make one for him.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
So, you love them.

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you want to make
a Meowtaro Land,

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
then you could
go to theme parks

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
-for research, right?
-Huh?

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
Instead of trying to
make something in a vacuum,

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:13.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
it'd be more helpful
if you go out there

00:17:13.568 --> 00:17:15.003 position:13% line:89% align:start
and see what already works.

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:16.671 position:13% line:89% align:start
Or what could be improved.

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:17.906 position:16% line:89% align:start
It could give you ideas!

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.072 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
That's a fair point.

00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
While we're at it,
what if everyone got together

00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:23.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
to go to a theme park
for Golden Week?

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:25.379 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Everyone?

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.347 position:24% line:89% align:start
That sounds great.

00:17:28.016 --> 00:17:29.651 position:19% line:89% align:start
It'll be fun. Let's go!

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:31.184 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
Well, if everyone is going,

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
then count me in for sure!

00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:34.722 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
What day is the best?

00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:37.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
[YAMAGISHI]
Let me check my calendar.

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:39.727 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
Hmm.

00:17:39.961 --> 00:17:41.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
So none of our schedules
match up.

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:43.965 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
Eh, it was a good idea.

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
It just wasn't meant to be.

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:49.537 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, I know.
Um, summer vacation.

00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:50.939 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about that?

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:52.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's plenty of time
'til then

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.208 position:13% line:83% align:start
so it should be pretty easy
to find a day we'd all be free.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.845 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess we're on
for summer vacation!

00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:03.450 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's it then.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:05.252 position:19% line:89% align:start
It would have been fun.

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:07.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] Senpai!
-Ah?

00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:10.157 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[panting]
-Yeah, what's up?

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.995 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, it's just,

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.864 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know everyone's schedules
didn't line up.

00:18:19.567 --> 00:18:21.669 position:30% line:83% align:start
But we're free!
So, uh.

00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:24.171 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:26.340 position:21% line:89% align:start
You and I could go...

00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:28.676 position:35% line:89% align:start
as friends.

00:18:31.546 --> 00:18:32.647 position:13% line:89% align:start
Because Yamagishi, she was

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
making it sound
like so much fun,

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I figured why wait
till summer? You know?

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's do it then.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.854 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.557 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's go and have fun.

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:44.191 position:35% line:89% align:start
You and me.

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.259 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:49.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:52.700 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:18:53.935 --> 00:18:54.869 position:38% line:89% align:start
For sure!

00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:56.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:57.805 position:38% line:89% align:start
No fair!

00:18:57.939 --> 00:18:59.507 position:30% line:83% align:start
First, you have
nothing else going on,

00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
then you're too busy?
Explain!

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:04.144 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's just say that I was being
a good bro about it

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:05.513 position:24% line:89% align:start
and call it a day.

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:06.748 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:13.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Do I go
with brand new and cute

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.824 position:10% line:89% align:start
or well broken in and comfy?

00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:20.427 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:24.732 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:27.635 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.469 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.508 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.410 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Sharp and fashionable,

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:38.880 position:16% line:89% align:start
or cozy and comfortable.

00:19:40.114 --> 00:19:41.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why is this so hard?

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:43.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[YUTAKA] Got a date?
-[gasps]

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.687 position:10% line:89% align:start
Stop popping into existence!

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
You always come home
for Golden Week

00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:49.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
and yet for some reason
you weren't there.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.060 position:27% line:83% align:start
Needless to say,
your absence was quite felt

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.327 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I came to check on you.

00:19:54.729 --> 00:19:55.763 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now tell me,

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
when's your date with Shiorin?

00:19:58.132 --> 00:19:59.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not a date!

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're going to a theme park
together just as friends.

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:04.839 position:38% line:83% align:start
You sure?
Sounds like a date.

00:20:05.073 --> 00:20:06.641 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, it's not!

00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:08.375 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't confessed to her,
nor have we started going out,

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:09.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
so the only thing
it could possibly be

00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.879 position:33% line:83% align:start
is us taking
a nice trip as friends!

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:13.081 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:16.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
You think going to a theme park
is something friends do?

00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:17.985 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I do.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.754 position:27% line:89% align:start
How interesting.

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:23.524 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER 12A]
Arriving at the park gate.

00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.225 position:13% line:89% align:start
Arriving at the park gate.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] I got here
sooner than I expected.

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:35.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should
wait at a cafÃ©?

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:37.839 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[SHIORI] Ah?
-Huh?

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.475 position:33% line:83% align:start
It looks like
we took the same train.

00:20:42.143 --> 00:20:43.310 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
So cute!

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:45.546 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
I got an early start today.

00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:47.414 position:10% line:89% align:start
Right, that's what I did too!

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.918 position:21% line:83% align:start
[smiles] Your vibe is
a little different than usual.

00:20:51.052 --> 00:20:52.319 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:53.821 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I mean, you put your hair up

00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:55.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
and you're wearing pants.

00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:56.691 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.227 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Well, I wanted
to dress for the occasion.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
I figured we'd be walking
a lot today,

00:21:01.863 --> 00:21:04.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I went with pants
and sneakers.

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:06.399 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah, same for me.

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:09.469 position:30% line:83% align:start
Honestly, we'll
probably get more steps here

00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:10.972 position:19% line:89% align:start
than on a hiking trip.

00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:12.840 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:21:13.641 --> 00:21:14.909 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's what I thought!

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:18.345 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess we should
probably get in line now, huh?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.347 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, why not?

00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:26.721 position:38% line:89% align:start

[giggles]

00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:34.896 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
I have this senpai at work

00:21:35.229 --> 00:21:37.330 position:16% line:89% align:start
who's so small and cute.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.837 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both laughing]

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's about time to head home.

00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:47.875 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:50.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
But before we do that.

00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:52.246 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.949 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you want to take
a quick picture?

00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:56.117 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wha...?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been a while
since I've been

00:21:57.652 --> 00:21:59.153 position:7% line:89% align:start
to a theme park with a friend.

00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:00.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's just a thought.

00:22:00.555 --> 00:22:02.322 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, of course. I'd love to!

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.691 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Want me to take it?

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
That would be great,
thank you!

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:08.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Manager?
-Big Sis and Hayakawa?

00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:09.462 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are you guys here?

00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:10.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just for fun.

00:22:10.865 --> 00:22:12.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
You were the one to suggest it.

00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:14.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
Remember,
you said theme parks

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:16.103 position:7% line:89% align:start
are for going out with friends.

00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:17.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, I did.

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:20.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA] Chihiro, we're going
to a theme park!

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:22.510 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Let's invite Hayakawa too!

00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:25.012 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Well...I guess that I can go.

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:26.681 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUTAKA]
And so, the three of us

00:22:26.814 --> 00:22:28.649 position:7% line:89% align:start
spent a wonderful day together.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.319 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Ah, well.
-Uh...

00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:33.921 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, scooch closer you two!

-[YUTAKA] Who's so fluffy?
-[AKINA] I hope

00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:42.563 position:38% line:83% align:start
that you
enjoyed yourself, Hayakawa.

00:22:42.964 --> 00:22:45.398 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] You know,
I think I actually did.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] It got a little
chaotic at the end, but...

00:22:48.368 --> 00:22:49.871 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
Yeah, that would be fun.
