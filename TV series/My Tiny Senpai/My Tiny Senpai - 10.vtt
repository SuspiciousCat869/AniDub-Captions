Ha! Magical Girl Shiorin!

Episode 27
"A New Ally"!

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Thank you.
I'll do better.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.291 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
It appears this old Demon Lord

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.360 position:13% line:89% align:start
still has some work to do.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.097 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
I want to introduce you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the newest member
of our team, A. Kina.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.902 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello!

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:37.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
He'll be here to help you
with anything you need.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.473 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even with my broken
magic compact?

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:41.108 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
You broke it again?

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.278 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm on it.
Good as new!

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:45.813 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow!

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
How did we get someone
as talented as him on staff?

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:51.351 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't know. He said
he peaked at this old job.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now he wants to give back
to society.

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? What job was that?
Was he like a CEO?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.192 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.330 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yoo-Hoo!
Anybody around?

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:04.832 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can't you knock?

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
And why in the world
are you wearing a lab coat?

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because I'm working
with the magical girl now.

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why would you be working
with the enemy?

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been gathering
important Intel,

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
things that can give you
the edge you need.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.746 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's really helpful!

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.247 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
It's brilliant!

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now my mentor can find
all my enemy's

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.216 position:24% line:89% align:start
weaknesses for me!

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:25.954 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I've already found
something.

00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:28.623 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
What did you manage to uncover?

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.292 position:10% line:89% align:start
She values loyalty in a man.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.128 position:7% line:83% align:start
How is that relevant to my job
as Demon Lord?

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.564 position:13% line:89% align:start
Should I not have told you?

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
No, of course you should have!
I'm incredibly grateful!

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
To be continued! Maybe!

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:17.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] This year
we're celebrating

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
our company's
40th anniversary.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:23.037 position:7% line:83% align:start
A milestone only made possible
by all of you.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.072 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.640 position:27% line:89% align:start
[crowd applauds]

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
And we have more good news.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.311 position:10% line:83% align:start
This year's new hire contest!
[crowd applauds]

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.748 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, a new hire contest?

00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:35.415 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a office-wide competition

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
between all the employees
in their first year.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.419 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:41.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know our manager
won the competition

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:43.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
in his first year
at the company.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:46.326 position:13% line:83% align:start
His proposal got him named
MVP, too!

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:49.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
It went on to be produced
and became a huge hit.

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.498 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you think
that's so impressive?

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:54.669 position:13% line:83% align:start
Actually, I feel kinda bad
for the other rookies.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.170 position:35% line:89% align:start
That said,

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:59.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
you really are an incredible
person, huh, Manager.

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:02.176 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.343 position:33% line:89% align:start
Nah, I would!

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:04.946 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laughs]
-Ugh!

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] Here's this
year's theme for the contest!

00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:09.584 position:30% line:83% align:start
[WALL WORKERS]
Wooow!

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.085 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
This year's prize

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
for the most promising
new hire

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the department
they work in is

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:17.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
an all-expenses paid trip
to a luxury resort

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.961 position:33% line:83% align:start
in beautiful,
sunny southern Okinawa!

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:21.394 position:30% line:83% align:start
[WALLA WORKERS]
Aah!

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.930 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's some prize.

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:24.932 position:21% line:89% align:start
If we won, I wonder.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
We're celebrating

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:29.070 position:30% line:83% align:start
so I picked up
this new swimsuit.

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.874 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now tell me,
what do you think, huh?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.810 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Senpai...
-Huh.

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.212 position:7% line:89% align:start
we're gonna win this for sure!

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:39.514 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yeah, that's the spirit!

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.249 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to have to
stay on top

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.050 position:10% line:89% align:start
of my regular duties, though.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.253 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, I can manage
your task balance!

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course. I'll help you
in any way I can!

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:49.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hayakawa as well.

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.893 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess I don't mind.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.661 position:16% line:89% align:start
With all of us behind you

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:55.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
we'll work hard
and win that award!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.698 position:41% line:89% align:start
Senpai,

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
I won't let you down!

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
I promise you.
I'll win us that trip!

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.672 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:06.574 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:09.043 position:33% line:83% align:start
So that's why
you're so fired up today.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
I gotta win this
for my department!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
Problem is,

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:16.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
I still haven't nailed down
an idea for my proposal.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:18.753 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about you?

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.656 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm giving the whole thing
a big 'ol pass.

00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:24.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Really? What about
the luxury resort!

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.927 position:24% line:89% align:start
Total deal-breaker.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
Dude, think about who
I'm stuck with every day in PR.

00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:32.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could you help me?
Pretty please?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nah, I'm good.

00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:35.903 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Honeybee.
-Teddy Bear.

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.171 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ew.

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
Any more time with them
sounds like a nightmare.

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:41.309 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That's rough, dude.

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
If only I too had hit
the workplace jackpot.

00:05:44.712 --> 00:05:46.047 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
You got a five-star senpai

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.516 position:21% line:83% align:start
and a five-star boss
on your first pull.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:49.784 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Don't talk about my coworkers

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.586 position:7% line:89% align:start
like they're gacha characters.

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
I should contact a job agent.

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:56.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe I can get a reset
on my pull?

00:05:56.624 --> 00:05:57.992 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA] I'm telling you,
the taste was

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.393 position:24% line:83% align:start
-out of this world.
-Well, speak of the devil.

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:02.462 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's your five-star senpai.

00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:04.431 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
They don't give you a limit!

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.800 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[smiles]
- [YAMAGISHI] No way!

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:07.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAYAKAWA]
And it's such a cute place.

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.402 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:10.638 position:13% line:89% align:start
We started at the same time

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
and make the same
amount of money,

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:14.642 position:10% line:83% align:start
but your life has some kinda
super-charged RNG!

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.210 position:10% line:89% align:start
If I had a senpai like yours,

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:18.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd be willing to work
Monday through Friday,

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
nine hours a day
minus one hour for lunch,

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:22.617 position:16% line:83% align:start
and take minimal bathroom
breaks throughout!

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] That's what you're
supposed to be doing now.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.855 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay, be real. How are
things going, Zakishino?

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:29.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
How's what going?

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:30.892 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
Don't play dumb, man.

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.094 position:30% line:83% align:start
How are things
with you and Katase?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.795 position:7% line:89% align:start
She came to your house, right?

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:36.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
And she took care of you
when you were out sick.

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
You even went on
a trip together recently,

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
so spill! Come on!

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:41.736 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Tell me!
-Well.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.104 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.075 position:21% line:89% align:start
Things are the same.

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.211 position:16% line:89% align:start
But how? Dude, for real?

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:52.980 position:7% line:83% align:start
You feel nothing when you look
at those ginormous jugs?

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:55.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't talk
about breasts at work!

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.518 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, I mean.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.656 position:35% line:83% align:start
I can't say
that I've felt nothing.

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.992 position:38% line:83% align:start
You mean
the deed has been done?

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
Give him back! Give me
back my pure Zakishino!

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:09.630 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Knock it off! I'm still pure!

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.498 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah. Huh?

00:07:12.066 --> 00:07:13.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
Five minutes left.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.002 position:24% line:89% align:start
Finish your lunch.

00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:18.205 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
Oh, hi. Kurusu, right?

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.341 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.311 position:33% line:83% align:start
Akari Kurusu
from Dev Group One?

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:25.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
Watch your back.
She's a killer.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.148 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:28.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE] You know
the Group One chief, right,

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
super by-the-books
and charismatic?

00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:33.254 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's who hand-picked her
as their rising star!

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.656 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kurusu, hands down,
has the hottest rep

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
out of anyone who got hired
the same year as us.

00:07:38.426 --> 00:07:40.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's been making big waves,
and she's the favorite to win

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:43.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
the most promising
new hire contest.

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:45.099 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
Time is a valuable resource

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
that should be used
productively.

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.770 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not wasted on idle chit-chat.

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:52.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] She sounds like
a living employee handbook!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:56.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
By the way, I heard
all your comments on breasts.

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:57.745 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both gasping]

00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.146 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURUSU]
That's harassment.

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.349 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
She's right, it is.

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:04.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
Except it doesn't count
with him and his Senpai

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.320 position:10% line:83% align:start
'cause they're madly in love
with each other.

00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:07.588 position:10% line:89% align:start
What the heck are you doing?

00:08:07.722 --> 00:08:09.924 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
So it's worse.

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:14.161 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because she's exploiting him
using their power dynamic.

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:17.098 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Senpai would never!
-Easy there, Zakishino.

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:19.066 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let me handle this one for ya.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.502 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
It can't be abuse, okay?

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.204 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[smiles]
-Because those two are dating!

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.672 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
That is not true!

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.207 position:30% line:89% align:start
Office romance?

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.342 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's unwise.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:31.212 position:24% line:83% align:start
This company isn't
a matchmaking service.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
And yet, according
to multiple surveys,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
more than a quarter
of all married couples

00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:36.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
met their partners
at the workplace.

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.085 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's no big deal.

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:39.520 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grins]

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:41.655 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:42.823 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:44.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, we're all friends here.

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:47.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] Kurusu.
[ALL] Huh?

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:50.031 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is rare.

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:52.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
You never hang out
in the break room.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
Director Takatsu-kasa.

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:56.771 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm. My apologies, ma'am.

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:59.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll make up any time
I've wasted.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, don't worry about that.

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:03.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
You still have time
on your break.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.647 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not about your mistakes,
it's how you handle them.

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:07.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're the fuel
that will carry you

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:09.917 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the next stage
of your career.

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:11.085 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.087 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you told me that woman
was a superhuman,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.022 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't question you
for a second.

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:17.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Look, she's glowing!
-Hmm?

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:21.195 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] You're Shinozaki
from Dev Group Two, right?

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:22.897 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Yes.
-I make a point

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.999 position:33% line:83% align:start
to keep tabs
on Group Two's hires.

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:28.235 position:7% line:83% align:start
Your manager and I were rivals
back in the day.

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:29.770 position:30% line:89% align:start
I had no idea.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.705 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then that would mean.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.375 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you think
that's so impressive?

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:37.344 position:27% line:83% align:start
I feel kinda bad
for the other rookies.

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:38.679 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grins]

00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:40.281 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
She's who I felt bad for!

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:43.184 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Something wrong?
-Nope, everything's fine!

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] Akina and I
joined the company

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:47.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the same time, and we've
been spurring each other

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:48.589 position:24% line:89% align:start
forward ever since.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even though he's the one
who always came out on top,

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
his proposal that year
was amazing.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then the product
became a huge hit.

00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:58.966 position:30% line:83% align:start
And ever since,
I've had my hands full

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
just trying to catch up to him.

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:05.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
But now, I've made history
with how far I've come here,

00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:09.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
and he's gotten comfortable
with not making waves

00:10:10.144 --> 00:10:11.979 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I remember those times.

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:14.148 position:7% line:89% align:start
We were at the top of our game,

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
always pushing each other
to reach our full potential.

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:20.121 position:21% line:89% align:start
And now I've realized

00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:22.957 position:10% line:89% align:start
to help me grow, I need him!

00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:24.792 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Huh?

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:27.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TAKATSUKASA] So I went
to the president with a plan.

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:28.996 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
Very well then.

00:10:29.598 --> 00:10:33.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
If Kurusu can win the most
promising new hire contest,

00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:36.203 position:10% line:83% align:start
I will consider transferring
Akina to your department.

00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.239 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Uh!

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:40.674 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, I'm not trying to win
a trip anymore.

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm trying to keep my manager!

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:45.212 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, he's a damsel in distress.

00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:47.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're doing the opposite
of helping!

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:49.083 position:38% line:83% align:start
I thought
that it might be unfair

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you didn't know the stakes
you were playing for.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:53.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
Although,
there's no chance you'll win,

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:55.590 position:13% line:89% align:start
so don't feel too torn up.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.391 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's get going, Kurusu.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[KURUSU] Right.
-Hold on a second!

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.129 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't care
if you think you need him.

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.298 position:24% line:89% align:start
I won't let him go.

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.535 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm going to win that contest.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.969 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. I know that look.

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:11.405 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're ready
for the next stage.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggles]
However.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.243 position:19% line:89% align:start
I will never be beaten.

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:18.245 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not by anybody.

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:21.248 position:19% line:83% align:start
This victory is as good
as mine.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.883 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.786 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
And it's the first of many,

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.223 position:21% line:83% align:start
because we're aiming
for even greater heights.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.125 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:32.459 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:34.828 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.699 position:7% line:83% align:start
Dude, it got so real, they made
a breeze come out of nowhere.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:39.967 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.902 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIYAMA]
I couldn't agree more!

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.039 position:7% line:89% align:start
That was fantastic, Shinozaki!

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
A powerful display
of subordinates

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:50.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
engaged in heated battle
on behalf of their bosses!

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a sight to behold.

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:55.449 position:19% line:83% align:start
You should fight, too.
Do it for me, bro!

00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:57.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even if I cared, I still can't

00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:58.786 position:16% line:89% align:start
because no one wants you.

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.722 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hot dog!
What a wild turn of events!

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.057 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so excited!

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.725 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUUSUKE]
Did you hear a word I said?

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.260 position:27% line:89% align:start
A battle over me!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[YUUSUKE] No one said that.
-Godspeed out there.

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.664 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
No matter how impossible,

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:12.266 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can't lose this contest!

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.438 position:13% line:83% align:start
Manager, can I talk to you
about something important?

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:19.574 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKINA]
Well, would you look at that!

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
in broad daylight. We can't
do that kind of PDA!

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:48.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Then again,
Senpai is a cat right now.

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:51.371 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
But then, I am a cat right now.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.508 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Ah...
-Um...

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:57.612 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Um. That's a good kitty.

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:00.480 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You know, now that I'm here,

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:03.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
life as a cat seems
like it'd be nice.

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay, your num-nums are
over here when you're ready.

00:18:06.621 --> 00:18:08.823 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I'm a cat.
I'm eating off the floor,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.390 position:24% line:89% align:start
because I'm a cat.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.628 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI] Senpai is really
committing to the bit,

00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:14.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
isn't she?

00:18:14.862 --> 00:18:16.463 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's meowth-watering.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're done eating so let's have
a picnic in the sandbox!

00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.836 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's a shark
inside the castle

00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:25.305 position:7% line:89% align:start
so we have to be extra careful.

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:27.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's a dangerous picnic.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll have to keep
our eyes out, Mommy.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.245 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-No, I'm Mommy!

00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:34.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're right. Sorry!
Please forgive me!

00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:38.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oh Shinozaki,
you can't do that to me.

00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:41.589 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all gasping]

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.492 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, Daddy, me and the cat
worked hard on that.

00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:48.963 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's not a daddy, and she's
not a cat, she's a girl!

00:18:49.097 --> 00:18:50.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
And there's no sharks!

00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:51.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
Y'mean you heard all of that?

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:56.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Have you been watching us?
-Nuh-uh! I... That's dumb!

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:57.772 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who would spy on her?

00:18:58.006 --> 00:18:59.040 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:01.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[SHINOZAKI] Listen Tomo!
-Huh?

00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:04.545 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-He's just a kid!

00:19:05.046 --> 00:19:07.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you like someone,
you should be nice to them.

00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:08.916 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:11.451 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Shinokazi smiles]

00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:15.590 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?
-Sorry.

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:17.625 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you still mad at me?

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:18.826 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, huh.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:21.228 position:10% line:89% align:start
I really am sorry, you know.

00:19:21.963 --> 00:19:22.964 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's fix it,

00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:26.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then can I play
with you afterwards?

00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:28.102 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARIN]
I guess that's okay.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.469 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all smile]

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.471 position:21% line:89% align:start
Alrighty then, Marin.

00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:33.574 position:24% line:83% align:start
So who will Tomo be
in our game?

00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:36.544 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tomo can be, the shark.

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:37.945 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
The shark?

00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.881 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yep, Tomo has to be the shark.

00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:41.549 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's mean and I hate sharks.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:45.820 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm the shark
and you hate the shark?

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.755 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:50.457 position:30% line:89% align:start
Bye-bye, lady!

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.659 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you for the picture!

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:53.393 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GIRL 10K]
Come back, okay?

00:19:53.728 --> 00:19:54.829 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bye-bye!

00:19:55.228 --> 00:19:56.463 position:41% line:89% align:start
See ya!

00:19:57.598 --> 00:20:00.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
How fun.
All those energetic kiddos!

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:01.936 position:24% line:89% align:start
You could say that.

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:06.040 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm so burned out, I don't even
want to hold a pencil anymore.

00:20:06.174 --> 00:20:07.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:10.778 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKINA] You were quite popular!
Our superstar artist!

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:13.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
-How do you feel, Shinozaki?
-Huh?

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:17.885 position:33% line:89% align:start
About today?

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
You think it'll help
with your proposal?

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:23.024 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, actually. I don't have
a solid idea yet,

00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:24.458 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I'm beginning to get there.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.694 position:30% line:83% align:start
It'll be tough,
but I know I can do it.

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:27.695 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll win this!

00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:30.031 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
That's the spirit!

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:31.766 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, by the way,

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:34.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
do you think Marin and Tomo
will be all right?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.269 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't see any reason
they wouldn't be.

00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:39.239 position:19% line:83% align:start
They'd already made up
by the time we left.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.909 position:21% line:89% align:start
So I wouldn't worry.

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:43.611 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's reassuring.

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.513 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:47.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you like someone,
you should be nice to them.

00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:51.451 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] That was a really
sweet thing for him to say.

00:20:59.694 --> 00:21:01.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now that I think about it,

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:04.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
Shinozaki's always going out
of his way to be nice to me.

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:07.869 position:10% line:83% align:start
Having trouble with that cap?
I'll get it for you.

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:09.137 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:10.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you too hot?

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:12.807 position:13% line:89% align:start
How about I turn on the AC?

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.008 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.444 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] He's never
not been nice to me! Ever!

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.515 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Hey! Senpai?

00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:22.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you feeling okay?
Do you need anything?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.284 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:25.987 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHINOZAKI]
Here, use my handkerchief!
