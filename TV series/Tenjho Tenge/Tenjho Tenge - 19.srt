Come on, dude!

what you wanna hear.

why does the midget
keep fighting?

Why did Mitsuomi kill Shin?

you guys a little bit?

You, the midget girl,
Mitsuomi Takayanagi,

told was the basic stuff.

We want you to fill
us in on the details.

guess I should start

No way.

Dammit, this sucks!

like a bunch of hoods.

ups in the executive council

32
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,419
were all katana
members, remember.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,220
So without the
backbone of the council

34
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,489
to keep things in
order, the whole campus

is pretty much in anarchy.

you reek right now?

Ha, what a loser.

It's a shame that he

gotta have five of our guys

The prelims are coming
up soon but, hmm,

64
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,891
after katana broke up, there's
no way Natsume's gonna have

enough time to pull together
a team of five bad asses.

I heard that since Shin went
and took out all those guys

68
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,702
in katana, he's gone
and created himself

a whole new club of his own now.

We still need two more people
to enter the preliminaries.

You got any ideas?

are dead set on winning,

any of your confidence.

second karate clubs,

can I say something here?

159
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,491
These preliminaries
you're talking about,

160
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,093
they're all just
martial arts clubs

161

going at each other right?

162
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,631
So what happens if you
don't belong to a club?

163
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,599
- What?

164
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,100
- Take me, for example,

165
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,369
I've got no formal
martial arts training,

166
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,304
but when it comes to
straight out street fighting,

167
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,040
I think I'm the biggest
bad ass in class.

168
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,277
- The Todo Academy is a school

learn about the martial arts,

but sometimes scum like
you manage to sneak in.

171
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:23,320
Seeing a crow cackling in a
field of falcons is pathetic,

a badass, scum?

little weak in the knees?

about joining us?

panties, because I
could really care less.

I've seen 'em before.

many times you ask,

my answer is still
going to be no,

especially if it's a club
that my brother created,

is that clear?

- Come on, will you
please reconsider?

199

Ever since Shin went out

than he could handle.

318
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,034
- Everything is inside here,

319
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:28,570
and still, nobody
will even look at me.

320
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,739
No one knows that I'm here.

321
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,777
It's as if I'm
invisible or something.

322
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:38,181
This is the shadows.

323
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,317
- Everything's
fine, big brother,

324
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,155
you're right here
standing in front of me.

325
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,729
And Maya's right here
holding onto you.

326
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:58,467
- Hoping to escape the
watch of the 12 clans,

327
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:01,103
Father arranged for my brother
to live with our elders

328
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:05,207
in Atohoku, then he let
him out of the dungeon.

329
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,842
But that night...

330
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,112
(dripping)

331
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,616
Brother, brother,
Father and Mother!

332
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:15,717
(sobbing)

333
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,220
Father and Mother!

334
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,323
Both of them are dead!

335
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:29,632
- Maya, from here on out
nothing will separate us.

336
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,802
(sobbing)

337
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:36,072
(chuckles)

338
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,075
- After that, my
brother was left empty,

339
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:43,746
and now, all that's left
inside him is that power.

340
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,983
That power has destroyed him.

341
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:52,154
You see, his soul was far
too weak to challenge it.

342
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:54,991
(sorrowful music)

343
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:02,097
Knowing what he went through,

344
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:04,567
the thought of becoming
stronger scares me.

345
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,938
- But aren't you more
afraid of doing nothing?

346
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,106
I gotta go.

347
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,009
I'm sure it's hard to
watch him struggle,

348
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,278
but leaving him alone
is even scarier.

349
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,814
So that's why I'm gonna
carry him on my back.

350
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,718
You've been carrying that
load for far too long.

351
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,254
You're not alone anymore.

352
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,659
- There you go with those cheap
lines that tug at my heart.

353
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:41,370
(sobbing) You're such a fool.

354
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:51,580
- Alright, with the
preliminaries being next week,

355
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,115
we need to figure out
how were gonna get

356
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,384
two more team members
as soon as possible.

357
00:20:56,886 --> 00:21:00,789
Mitsuomi, what's up, didn't
you say that you had a lead?

358
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,692
- Well I did, but they said no.

359
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,260
- Another one, huh.

360
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:06,795
- Well I haven't even looked.

361
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:08,030
Didn't even try.

362
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,399
- Ah, you asshole!

363
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,335
- What?

364
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,935
- Go out there and find someone!

365
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,471
- Hell no, you ought to
be grateful I'm even here,

366
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:17,907
so back off!

367
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,642
- This is Scum.

368
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:23,078
He's a little souvenir
from my class.

369
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,347
I brought him here to you
guys because he mentioned

370
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:27,917
something about wanting to
be in the preliminaries.

371
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,453
- Nice to meet ya.

372
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:37,860
- I'll join the club for
now, but our bet is still on.

373
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,732
I think we owe it to
ourselves to find something

374
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:47,703
better than a fortune to
settle our fate. (giggles)

375
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,944
(singing in foreign language)

376
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:26,200
- Light and shadow throwing
oneself into the flame

377
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:28,202
knowing you're
going to get burned.

378
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:31,573
Next episode of Tenjho
Tenge, Stratagem.

379
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,677
Big brother, challenge the
fate that lies before you.
