he actually seemed to
buy that rationale.

But actually, it was an order
from the Takayanagi family

the real intentions all along,

He even started fixing
up some abandoned bike,

that old engine to start

ride to the next town over

it was growing,

to nurture that light.

was was friendship.

- Because you were
starting to fall for Maya.

That was just another reason
I had to approach you.

I knew that I had to
stop that no matter what.

that it would devastate Shin.

Just look at you.

You were born the heir of
the famous Takayanagi family,

you wear after you're born
