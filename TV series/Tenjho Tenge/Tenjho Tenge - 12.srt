We were cruising
around town one night

could barely see 'em.

182
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,102
But, it seemed like a chick.

183
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:41,872
She had this hat on her head
but, there was this hair

spilling out like this!

tried to cover this up.

He did it to protect me.

Because I'm so weak.

That's the only reason he
wanted to become stronger.

Will you give us a
moment of privacy?

- Yes, but sir.

00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:30,139
- This location's secure.

320

There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

- What's wrong, don't
you find her attractive?

325
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:03,372
I've been told you haven't
even laid a finger on her.

326
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,874
Perhaps it's because
you remember her name

327
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,443
from somewhere in your past?

328
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,611
- Master, what is it you want?

329
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,380
I know that I'm only a student.

330

But I'm afraid that I still
don't have much free time.

(chuckles) Why don't
you take a guess.

333
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,859
Use that dragons eye
that you're so proud of.

to worry about miss.

What you did earlier
really hurt little girl.

346
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,951
I'll tell you what, give me
a little piece of that booty

of yours and we'll call it even.

of me is what you really want,

then you just go ahead
and make your move.

350

But you'll have to
get past these first!

Trying to finish me off?

Bring it on you bastard!

Why are you acting so quiet?

369

You're nothing but a shadow.

370

A pitch black darkness devoid
