useless to try and stop them.

It's something that

Let's say the whole world
went completely dark,

197

light to be found anywhere.

- [Maya] Yeah?

199
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,219
- I, too, would be
just like these guys

it's gonna burn me,

I still couldn't keep
myself away from it.

203
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,797
And just like them, it'd
burn my wings off too.

204
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,699
And then I would
fall to the ground

and become covered in dirt.

206

I'd become so filthy that no
one would even recognize me.

I'd know all this, and still

208

I'd go straight into that flame.

like this flame, Maya.

young to understand

discovered his dragon's eye,

his destiny would take him.

you stop that.

I can't believe that
anybody could take out Shin.

isn't that big of a deal.

Shin since I was just a kid,

246

and we had a hell of a time too.

247
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,875
But there were times
when he didn't make

248
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,411
any sense to me at all.

249
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,881
I don't know why, but when it
came to him protecting Maya,

250
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,552
Shin always seemed so
serious and desperate.

- I think she's the only
person he feels connected to.

253
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,500
It's as if she's the
only one in the world

254
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,102
he thinks he can really trust.

255
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,974
And there I was, the whole time,
completely blind to it all,

256
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:47,343
just trying to
get his attention.

257
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:50,413
For over 12 years now I've
been running with that guy,

258
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:53,216
and I just now realize this.

259
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,952
- Just rest, Bunshichi.

260
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,190
- [Fu] I want to sincerely
thank you for today.

261
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,159
I got the chance to witness

262
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,896
a very entertaining
battle, Master Dougen.

263
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,031
- I found the whole
thing rather ridiculous.

264
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,401
I need to completely
reconsider my plans for Shin.

265
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,904
Gather all the data we
have on Shin Natsume,

266
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:17,373
and send it to me.
- Right away.

00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,509
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,447
- Will you do away
with Mr. Natsume?

269
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:26,415
I have to admit that
I personally find

270
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,085
that one to be rather amusing.

271
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:36,392
There's much power in a
darkness that seeks to fight,

272
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:37,961
even on the brink of death.

273
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:42,799
That is the power
of the dragon's eye.

274
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:47,536
And let's not forget about
his personal feelings, either.

275
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:49,672
Depending on how
you use all of this,

276
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,307
he could very well
have what it takes

277
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,209
to become the true
martial artist

278
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,245
that you have been
looking for, Master.

279
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,316
- Are you trying to tell me
what I should do, Fu Chen?

280
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,551
- I wouldn't think of
doing such a thing.

281
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:03,753
These are simply the thoughts

282

from someone from
Taiwan's underground.

283

Please, sir, pay no
attention to them.

284
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:11,794
But before I go, we should
discuss Mr. Mitsuomi.

His heart just isn't in
it like it used to be.

And as a consequence,

Do you think Shin Natsume

could have something
to do with this?

that light back in his eyes.

And when he does,

around like that.

318
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,447
But apparently that isn't
the case now, is it?

319
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:16,085
This whole thing feels
so complicated now.

320
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,792
Big brother, do you
remember the story

321
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:26,262
you once told me about
the moth and the flame?

322
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:31,266
I believe to this very
day you still think of me

323
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:34,237
as that scared little
girl standing by the fire.

324
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,779
(whooshing)

325
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:55,291
You, you were awake
this whole time?

326
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,963
(whimpers) Let go.

327
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,865
- Don't leave me, Maya.

328
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:07,469
(Maya sobs)
(sad music)

329
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,404
- You're going to be just fine.

330
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:11,174
I'm not going to go anywhere.

331
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,377
- I'm scared, Maya,
and the flames,

332
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,779
the flames are
starting to burn me.

333
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,148
(flames crackling)

334
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,284
- There's nothing
to worry about.

335
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,519
I'm still right here.

336
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,590
- Maya, you are my only light.

337
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:33,595
You are my flame,
don't forget that.

338
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:36,065
- That's right, I
remember it now.

339
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,604
- And for me, you're just
like this flame, Maya.

340
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:46,242
- I don't wanna, I
don't wanna be a flame.

341
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,012
I don't wanna be anything
that's gonna hurt you.

342
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:53,849
- Maya.
- I wanna be a butterfly,

343
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,485
and you can be one, too.

344
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:02,859
We can both be butterflies
together, okay?

345
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:18,508
(slow dramatic music)

346
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,022
If the same flame
that burns my brother

347
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,991
were to consume me as well,

348
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,895
(flames whooshing)

349
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,936
I would no longer
have anything to fear.

350
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,512
(gentle music)
(singing in foreign language)

351
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,263
(urgent music)

352
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,599
Can I catch up and overcome it?

353
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,135
Can I actually defeat
that shadow called fear

354
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:28,770
that dwells within me?

355
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:31,973
Next episode of "Tenjho
Tenge," Yin and Yang.

356
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:35,110
You'd better catch up, too,
Mitsuomi, before it's too late.
