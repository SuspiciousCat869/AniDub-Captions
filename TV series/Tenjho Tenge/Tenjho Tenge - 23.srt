We're the original

330
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,356
this day would come.

331
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,960
I could see it coming,

332
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:26,563
even without the Dragon's Eye.

333
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,465
A girl just knows
this kind of thing.

334
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,869
It seems both of us
were destined to lose.

335
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:38,040
In the end, we couldn't
defeat our weaknesses.

336
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,041
Or our fate.

337
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,145
I've heard you say

338
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:46,082
that no one is born
completely naked.

339
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,019
It's true.

340
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,289
But that's why,
when a person dies,

341
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,759
they have a chance to
throw everything away.

342
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,863
It's God's gift.

343
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,132
He's giving them
a whole new life,

344
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,735
a chance to start again.

345
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,171
But even after you're gone,

346
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,207
a piece of you will
always stay here,

347
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,744
locked safe within
someone's heart.

348
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:21,450
And I guess that's the proof

349
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,753
that we actually lived
at all, isn't it?

350
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:31,159
Maya.

351
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,730
Please look after
Mitsuomi for me.

352
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,534
Don't make him walk the
same path that Shin did.

353
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,672
I'm sorry, Mitsuomi.

354
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,441
I'm afraid I won't be
able to keep that promise

355
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,443
that I made to you.

356
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,181
- [Maya] Big brother...

357
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,382
- [Shin] Even then,

358
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,685
at the very end,

359
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,855
I couldn't change the
way that I felt for her.

360
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:03,259
(melancholy violin music)

361
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,611
- Goodbye, Shin.

362
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,781
Even in this final moment,

363
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,085
your heart was
never mine to have.

364
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,589
Yet your soul

365
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,758
and your tears

366
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:41,964
will stay with me forever.
