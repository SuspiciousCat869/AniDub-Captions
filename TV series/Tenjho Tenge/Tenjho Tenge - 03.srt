I was totally useless.

I couldn't even help the

Those are questions we

The answer, however, is quite
simple and rather obvious.

I want to know.

230
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,073
- The executive council
has been in existence

231
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:59,976
for a very long time, since
the school the Todo Academy

232
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,146
is based on, the Tobu
School was first built.

233
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,450
The Tobu school was built
so that martial arts

234
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,452
could be taught
again, as a result,

235
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,388
the founders of the
school brought in masters

236
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,858
and instructors from all
over, almost by force.

237
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:17,394
And in order to maintain
decorum amongst the ranks

238
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,397
in the school they had
to establish some form

239
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:22,165
of supreme power and discipline.

240
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,035
- So the executive council
can do whatever it wants then?

241
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:28,204
- You shouldn't try
to mess with them.

242
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:30,173
They're not the kind of
people that a street fighter

Is this because that katana
belonged to our brother,

but you didn't get
upset like this

belonged to him as well,

320

you give me three
months and I promise

321

I'll be stronger
than all you guys.

And crush the executive
council while we're at it.

- Hmm.

325

You can't swallow the spit
that's already been spat on you.

But I like your spirit,
you're more than welcome.

day, what will later be known

Juken club ever,

gathered for the first time.

What do you mean?

332
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:55,170
- I just told you, Maya
Natsume has sent a request

333
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,806
asking that the expulsion
of Souichiro Nagi

334
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:01,277
and Bob Makihara please be
revoked as soon as possible.

Who the hell does she
think she's trying to fool?

- In addition to
that she told us

339
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,652
that she has allowed
the two of them

340

This drastically goes

00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,931
the executive council's
decision Ryuuzaki.

346

347

the executive council
so lightly, Natsume.

348

The decision is going to be no,

349
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:31,807
those two have been expelled.

350
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,943
The decision has already
been decided upon.

351
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,645
In this school
the decisions made

352
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:39,548
by the executive council
are perfect and absolute.

353
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,884
There's no way they
can be overturned.

354
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,486
And now you want them
to join the Juken club,

355
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:47,322
forget it, you know we'd never
allow something like that.

You understand what I'm saying?

Are you even listening to me?

Don't you ignore me.

359

I can't help thinking maybe,

361

you're afraid of those two.

362
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:00,869
- Careful now, don't go
thinking that you're always

363
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,039
going to be stronger
than me, Natsume.

about I char it up a bit?
