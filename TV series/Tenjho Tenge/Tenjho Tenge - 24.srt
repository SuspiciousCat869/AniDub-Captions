I've been thinking a
lot about that match,

so I did some research,
and you know what?

There's still one thing that
I just don't understand.

27

- [Mitsuomi] It's this one
true martial artist bit

28
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,932
that I found in our
family's legends.

00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,802
What did you want, for me to
become a god or something?

30
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,978
- Mitsuomi, do you know

31
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,215
the symbolism behind
our family's crest,

32
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:07,252
the Takayanagi hallmark,
the flying phoenix?

33
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,955
Its right wing is
called the Shirohaneshu

34
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,091
and the left wing
is the Akahaneshu.

35
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,595
The Shirohane are martial
artists and continue to thrive,

36
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,264
while the Akahane have
since dwindled away.

37
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,467
There are entire families
that are now lost to us,

38
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,402
and here's the reason why.

39
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:25,870
As society advanced,

40
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,307
their special powers
were made obsolete.

41
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,610
However, these people
do still exist.

42
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,380
They're born all the time.

43
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,752
Their story is pathetic
and it's my responsibility

44
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,221
to save their wretched souls.

45
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:47,225
That's the duty I have as the
head of the Takayanagi family

46

and as Kaima'a best friend,

hired Master Fu's friends.

Listen, Dad, you may

but you're wrong
about the superhumans.

It's not salvation they need.

It's absolute power.
