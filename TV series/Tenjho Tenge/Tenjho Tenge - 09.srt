You know, I still
don't get it though.

If this could end inside
of just two minutes,

why'd Mitsuomi wait 'til
now to do something?

why do it now?

What suddenly made him
decide to settle the score?

105

They're quite real,

You can't predict 'em.

I'm sure the president
had figured this out.

Take this mask, and
get rid of it for me.

It's not something that I
will be needing any longer.

Two years ago, back
when we were freshmen,

A king will always be

- By now the soriusho I
delivered to you earlier

I understand why.

(intense music)

129
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,844
Chi is usually created
within the body itself,

130
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,813
and as a consequence it will
only work within that body.

131
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,850
That's why there's a limit to
the amount of chi one can use,

132

so if you continue to use it
you will eventually run out.

Even I face this issue.

However, there are a few
exceptions to this rule.

There are those with enough chi

to heal themselves from my
attacks almost instantly.

137

It's a limitless chi

that warps the atmosphere
around the user.

00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,912
I've seen him battle against
Masataka and Riyuzaki.

162
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,983
I cannot allow this boy to
continue to go unchecked.

163
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,288
- Ah!

164
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,126
(Mitsuomi groans)

165
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,465
(Souichiro grunts)

166
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,302
(Mitsuomi groans)

167
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,405
- He's actually taking hits!

168
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,974
Mitsuomi is, is a martial artist

169
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,944
with an unparalleled
ability to guard himself,

170
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,214
but he's really taking
some damage right now.

171
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,616
It's just like it was last time.

172
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,753
This is exactly what
happened two years ago.

173
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,722
Boy, you really are...

174
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,359
Boy, stop it!

175
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,999
- You truly are a
foolish woman, Maya.

176
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,401
What do you want?

177
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:39,370
You want to watch me
kill yet another one?

178
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:44,309
A martial artist with an
unlimited amount of chi.

179
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,177
Chi of this nature
is not created

180
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,047
within the confines
of the human body.

181
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,916
Some call it God, some a dragon,

182
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,853
others call it an
apparition or a demon.

183
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,489
There's all sorts
of names for it,

184
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,758
but they all mean one thing.

185
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,261
The chi that exists
outside the body

186
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,029
in the trees and the wind,

187
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,435
people call those that can
control such chi, spirits.

188
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,204
Spirits use their immense power

189
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:17,474
to perform feats of
constant recklessness.

190
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,610
Just like your
brother used to do.

191
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:23,046
You killed them both.

192
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,817
Your brother, and this boy too.

193
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,653
Senior at Todo Academy,

194
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,588
head of Gaokishi style,

195
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,790
president of the
executive council,

196
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,828
Mitsuomi Takayanagi attacks!

197
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:41,298
- [Maya Voiceover] Why am
I not trying to stop this?

198
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,600
If Mitsuomi really
is ready to fight,

199
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,435
that boy doesn't have a prayer,

200
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:47,871
even if he is a
descendant of that clan.

201
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,172
He's going to die.

202
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,408
The boy is going to die!

203
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,643
I've got to do something!

204
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,979
(Mitsuomi yells)

205
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
- Chill!

206
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,517
- Bunshichi!

207
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,420
- Goodness, things were
really heating up here.

208
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,222
I had to cool this scene down.

209
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,257
So tell me, who is
it now that's got you

210
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,359
all hot and bothered like this?

211
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,862
- You really don't know
when you're needed, do you?

212
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,864
If you had just taken
control of the squad

213
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,298
from the beginning...

214
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,801
- Now come on, I only
joined the executive council

215
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,970
because you said I didn't
have to do anything.

216
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,539
Where else can I see high
school students kill each other,

217
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,407
and bullshit about spirits?

218
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,743
You guys are all
completely whacked.

219
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:27,911
Now what are you doing

220
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,247
harassing such a
cute little freshman?

221
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,148
Huh, senpai?

222
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,117
- What happened?

223
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,051
- Relax, he just checked out.

224
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:37,220
Probably a result of
that suffocating aura

225
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,055
that follows you
wherever you go.

226
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,191
See, he's all nice and sweet

227
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,794
around a cool cat
like me, right?

228
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:45,929
Hey, what's your deal punk?

229
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,430
I just saved your ass!

230
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:50,400
You ungrateful, you're gonna
die for that you little prick!

231
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:52,502
What are you...
- Mitsuomi.

232
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,637
Just so that you're
clear on this,

233
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:57,374
I've no interest in
returning to how things were.

234
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,975
If it wasn't for my injuries,

235
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:01,912
I would've had no problem
fighting you today.

236
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:04,048
- Don't lie to me.

237
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,050
- [Bunshichi] Okay
stop that hurts!

238
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,283
If that leaves a mark,

239
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,252
I'm really gonna be
so pissed off at you!

240
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,654
Okay okay uncle, you
win, just let go!

241
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:13,023
Let go of me, damn it!

242
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:17,161
(gentle flute music)

243
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,339
- Nice work!
- Way to go!

244
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,040
- Are the police here?

245
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,308
- [Man] There's a few outside,

246
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,043
but nothing to be
concerned about.

247
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,545
We got the employees
here scared enough

248
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:37,280
to back us up on the story

249
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,116
that we had rented this place
out for a bowling tournament.

250
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,318
- Tell them we'll cover
the cost of repairs,

251
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,287
and throw in some cash
for the employees.

252
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,189
The Isuzu family
will foot the bill.

253
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,190
Kagurazaka.

254
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,126
- Mitsuomi is still
inside the building.

255
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,561
He told me to warm up his bike

256
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,730
like I was some sort
of common house boy.

257
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:54,964
The nerve of that man.

258
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,232
- [Emi] What happened
to your face?

259
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,567
It looks horrible.

260
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:00,570
- My face may look like
I lost, but I didn't.

261
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:04,008
I spent most of my time making
sure I kept Junior in check.

262
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,977
- Mr. Kagurazaka.

263
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,115
Now I wanna show you
what it'll feel like

264
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,384
when I go all the way.

265
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:18,889
(Masataka grunting)

266
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:21,892
- An obvious feint attack.

267
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,628
So predictable!

268
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,299
(intense music)

269
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,880
Come on, what do you
think you're doing?

270
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,082
You told me that I could
have my way with him!

271
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,751
You're spoiling this for me!

272
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,656
- This fight was
over, have some style.

273
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,826
You still have a ways to go.

274
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,796
You can become even stronger.

275
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,464
- He's such an ass,

276
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:04,367
that Mitsuomi acting
all high and mighty.

277
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,569
Look what he's done
to my perfect skin.

278
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,439
I won't forgive him for this.

279
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,174
What?

280
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,809
- [Emi] The president
was fighting

281
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,178
against both Bob and Masataka

282
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,181
and you thought it'd be
okay to just stroll outside?

283
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:21,050
- Oh relax, this is
Mitsuomi after all.

284
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,718
He bragged that he'd
have this whole thing

285
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,420
wrapped up in three minutes.

286
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,922
- Listen you little shit!

287
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:29,091
If anything happens to our
president, I will kill you!

288
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,860
- It's just, hold on!

289
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,962
What's with her?

290
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,098
- Damn it!

291
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,599
What was I thinking?

292
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,401
I should never have let
him take care of Mitsuomi.

293
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,737
He can't even act as
a security shield!

294
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Ah?

295
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,578
If he was just fighting
a one-on-one battle,

296
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,315
I wouldn't care who Mitsuomi
was going up against.

297
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,752
But, this isn't just
a one-on-one battle.

298
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,631
It's Isuzu, are you all right?

299
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,734
- How's the withdrawal going?
- We're almost done.

300
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,936
Just making sure no
one else is here.

301
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:15,871
- I owe one to Bunshichi.

302
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:17,807
If I'd kept going with that boy,

303
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,809
I might have lost.

304
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,577
This is pathetic.

305
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:25,581
I chastise Masataka for
wearing out after a measly 80,

306
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:28,617
and I spend just a few minutes
fighting a couple of freshmen

307
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:32,188
and my body's completely spent.

308
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,223
When he saw Masataka
lying there,

309
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,125
defeated by me,

310
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,929
the anger in that boy's
eyes was so very real.

311
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,401
All on his own,
Masataka has managed

312
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:48,070
to earn the trust of
some powerful comrades.

313
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,271
It's becoming quite clear

314
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:52,442
that the Takayanagi
family is not his place.

315
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,211
My father never
taught me that allies

316
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,814
could be so valuable.

317
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:01,817
- But you have allies,
you have all of us.

318
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,652
The executive council.

319
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,155
We'd die for you
if you asked us to.

320
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,824
I know the core
members of the council,

321
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,127
like myself and Tagami,

322
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,928
all feel that way.

323
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,533
You are the bigger power
that bonds us together.

324
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:19,869
You must stay alive.

325
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,704
You have to do that for us,

326
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,305
and for yourself.

327
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:25,041
Even if it's just another day.

328
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:30,247
I'll risk it all, everything
just so I can protect you.

329
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,617
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come in.

330
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,653
- [Mitsuomi] No, I
should get out of here.

331
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:39,788
Look the other way when I leave.

332
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,090
- Of course.

333
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,927
(emotional music)

334
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,534
One last thing, sir.

335
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:54,670
Maya Natsume was
a tough opponent.

336
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:58,073
If by chance I had met
her before I met you,

337
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,976
I could easily have
become her friend.

338
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:03,279
- [Mitsuomi] I see.

339
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,116
(emotional music)

340
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:14,257
And I wanted to meet you,
before I met Maya too.

341
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:21,331
- Okay kiddo, rise and shine.

342
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:27,302
- Look at you.

343
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,071
I expected more than this.

344
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:31,107
I'm disappointed, Takayanagi.

345
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,143
- Wha, huh?

346
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:34,978
- [Maya] How is he?

347
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:35,912
He's not up yet?

348
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:36,846
Let me try.

349
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,048
- Don't you touch him!

350
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,051
Why do they have
to fight like this?

351
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,318
Just look at the two of them,

352
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,821
Bob and Na-Chan are
a complete mess!

353
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,691
I'm beginning to wonder if
all this is just about you!

354
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,326
Well is it?

355
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,462
What exactly is
all of this about?

356
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,897
I wanna know what's going on!

357
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,665
Why do they keep fighting us?

358
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,301
I mean, it turns out
that that president guy

359
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:01,403
is nothing more than
your ex-boyfriend!

360
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,705
What is this, some
kind of lover's spat?

361
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:05,908
I agree that both
Na-Chan and Bob here

362
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,676
have spun off into the deep end

363
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,378
since they started this school,

364
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,213
but if the two of them
hadn't hooked up with you,

365
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:13,448
things would have never
gotten this out of control!

366
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:14,950
And as for me!

367
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:17,520
(girl sobbing)

368
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,624
- All right.

369
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,160
Go on and spill it, all of it.

370
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:28,163
Everything that's happened
between you and Mitsuomi.

371
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:30,265
They need to know
what really went down.

372
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,267
That it's not just some
high school romance

373
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:33,770
gone horribly awry.

374
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,542
- Two years ago, Mitsuomi fought

375
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:42,712
and killed my older brother.

376
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:46,181
Calling it a fight
is an understatement

377
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:48,083
for what actually happened.

378
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,686
What it really was
was a death match.

379
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,588
My brother lost the fight,

380
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,489
and died as a result.

381
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,557
- What?

382
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,393
- No one really won that fight.

383
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:01,596
My brother took Mitsuomi's
life from him as well.

384
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:02,831
- What?

385
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:07,102
- He's still alive,
but just, just barely.

386
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:09,504
And I'm beginning to
wonder if at this point,

387
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,340
he'll even have enough
time to accomplish

388
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,775
what he set out to do.

389
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,646
This means I'm beginning
to run out of time as well.

390
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:20,315
I have to do something
while I still can.

391
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:23,652
I've got to settle the
score before he dies.

392
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:25,120
You're awake.

393
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,155
- Stop beating around the
bush already, will ya?

394
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,524
Tell us everything
that happened.

395
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,026
- Don't you think we
have a right to know

396
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,729
exactly what we're up against?

397
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:36,965
- All right.

398
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,935
But, first we have to get
ourselves out of this building.

399
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,570
We can continue this at home.

400
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,004
- You got it.

It all happened

403
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:50,879
in less than 30 minutes,

404
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,248
but together the two sides

405
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:56,251
managed to put over 100
people on the injured list.

406
00:20:56,252 --> 00:21:00,056
Some just had cuts and scrapes,
others seriously wounded.

407
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,591
I've never understood
what my brother

408
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,192
was hoping to
achieve by becoming

409
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,995
president of the
executive council.

410
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:11,833
But today I realized, that
whatever his objective may be,

411
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,935
he wants nothing more
than to see it fulfilled

412
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:15,104
before he dies.

413
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,473
The executive council
has just confirmed

414
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,709
that it sees the Juken
Club as a threat.

415
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,244
I imagine the members
of the council

416
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,280
will have a much closer
bond with each other now.

417
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,250
Ironically, by making
the Juken Club stronger,

418
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:30,486
we've made the council
stronger as well.

419
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,258
We're the ones who lost
the battle that day.

420
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,061
The five of us behaved like
individuals, not club members.

421
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:42,664
We were more divided
than all 200 members

422
