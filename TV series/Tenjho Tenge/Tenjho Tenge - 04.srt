If I move the point
of impact halfway down

69

on the metal plate in theory
the pan should just stay

70

in one place.

71
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,625
I got the concept down, but,

72
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,760
- Well it won't do you
any good using brain power

73
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,696
you don't have if you keep
going along at this rate

you won't eat again today.

75

We're going on day three now.

77
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,437
- I can't believe this, you
can't even do a backhand.

78
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,673
They also call the
backhand the firefist,

79
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:12,143
or as it's referred to
in Chinese the Su-Hi-Ken.

80
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,145
It's difficult to put
the concept of shifting

81
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,648
the impact point and the
focal point into words.

82
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,750
But when you become
a master you are able

83
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,587
to concentrate your power to
any location that you desire.

84
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,423
Controlling the flow strength
and quality of your power

85
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,592
is the key principle of I-key,

86
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,827
humans, heaven and
earth, yin and yang,

87
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:33,331
the five elements, if the
world moves it creates yang,

88
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,567
if it is still it creates
yin, form creates chi

89
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:37,568
chi creates god.

90
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,973
Realize that Takayanagi and
you are not that far apart

91
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,742
when it comes to your
basic physical abilities.

92
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:47,145
What you lack is the
concept and the focus

93
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,614
that allows you to
control that power.

94
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,849
- I need more focus, huh?

95
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,319
- So, what do you
want me to do next?

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,655
I ran the 20 kilometers
like you asked.

97
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,991
In exactly one hour
and 10 minutes,

98
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,226
even a marathon runner
would be impressed.

99
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,862
- Your quite fortunate
to be physically gifted.

100
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,631
You have the height,
the limber muscles

101
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,865
and the jumping ability

102
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,067
that is quite unique
to your genetics.

103
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:12,136
You need to run
and run some more,

104
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,006
feed your muscles with as
much oxygen as possible

105
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,074
that alone will
make you stronger.

106
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,709
- All right.

107
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,411
- When it comes to
body, soul and mind,

108
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,780
you're both in the
developmental stage.

109
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,149
It is possible for you two
to go back to square one

110
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,717
and start over again.

111
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,519
- I haven't seen my
sister look this happy

112
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,421
in a really long time.

113
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,823
- Hmm, and I can't believe
they're all out here this early

114
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,626
I'm looking forward
to this summer.

115
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:36,627
- Me too.

116
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,937
- So Ryuuzaki was beaten.

117
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,506
- Yes, by Maya Natsume.

118
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:49,774
- Hmm.

119
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,509
- There's more, she
has also gone ahead

120
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,879
and allowed those two freshmen
to join the Juken club.

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,214
She's disobeyed the
executive council.

122
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,917
- I was initially given
a quite simple task,

123
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,186
annihilate these
two freshmen here,

124
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,021
but if they've joined
the Juken club,

125
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,823
then this gets much better.

126
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,693
This is now an opportunity
to destroy my nemesis

127
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,828
the Juken club.

128
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,931
- I'm counting on you,
this is for your precious

little pro wrestling fan club.

130
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,401
One more thing,

131
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,170

he's held responsible

132
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,306

think I was quite clear

133

when I said there was
no room for error.

134

135
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:36,020
I will enforce the order
and rules of this academy.

136

everyone, food's ready.

The Juken club and

I didn't say that I
wished to speak to you.

the President asked
that I relay a message.

Come back when you're no
longer wearing diapers.

I don't see what it

Right Mitsuomi.

what to do, Bunshichi.

it was the advisors job

to state his opinions
to the President.

179

What you really should be
hating is the Juken club

Ha, but that's not
actually true either,

It even has an outdoor

most of our savings

But having you here Miss Chiaki,
really has been a big help.

My sister can't cook and
it's always a huge chore

You know Miss Chiaki,

a very attractive girl.

204
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,561
I don't think I'm
attractive at all.

205
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:33,063
I can barely get Souichi-sama
to acknowledge that I exist.

206
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:36,099
- That's because No-chon
doesn't realize how attractive

you really are, Aya.

Hmm.

You are so dead,
there won't even

be charred remains left, Sakura.

327
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:39,462
- Because you chose to rely
on such childish magic tricks,

328
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,797
you forget the true
nature of martial arts

329
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:44,301
and then fall victim to
someone like Natsume.

One more thing,

331

right now I am not Sagura,

this mask on my head,

339
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,196
the basic principles
of martial arts

are actually quite
simple, there is no need

for this use of chi like you
and Natsume insist on using,

all humans, even the
best martial artists

to control their bones,

there's exactly 206
bones in the body

345

and a whole lot of
places to break them.

Now while I personally make
sure that those two freshmen

00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:38,454
are taken care off, you
will be busy counting

the ceiling tiles in
your hospital room.

- You, you were very
impressive Mr Sa, Mr Saga-mask.

351
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:48,931
- You did away with Ryuuzaki
in a matter of seconds.

00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,200
- Aren't you guys getting
ahead of yourselves,

353

haven't you two forgotten
something rather important?

- Oh oh, that's right.

355

One, two,

I don't even remember
falling asleep.

Um, why is my head in her lap?

chi more than control it,

if you accomplish that you
can do something like this.

impressive modification.

What you're looking at
now is my true form.

- The reason I normally
take on the form of a child

372

is to hold back the
unwanted release of chi.

- Oh, but then why the hassle?

I've chosen to train.

There's a certain man I

any time to lose then, huh?

All right you and me are

ridiculously strong she is

But you know, there's
something about her

exactly like me.
