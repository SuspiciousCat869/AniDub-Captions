I'm sure you guys had
nothing to do with it.

Mitsuomi.

me why I chose you.

The answer is inside that box.

As head of the Gou Kishi Style,

is to watch over anyone
with supernatural powers.

361
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,274
Shin Natsume is a
valuable data sample.

362
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:35,377
His power surfaced early
on in his childhood.

363
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,813
With his permission,
he has been continually

364

watched and recorded by
several dozen staff members

365

for quite some time.

366
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,221
And because the
Kuzunoha family serves

under the Takayanagi clan,

368

I had no choice.

369
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,095
I had to accept the role
of Shin's girlfriend.

370
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:56,166
It was merely a task I
was given, nothing else.

Why do I wish I was
close to him right now?

374
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,682
- Miss Mana.

375

- [Mana] The moon sure
looks pretty tonight.

376
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,487
I wonder if we'll see
some sunshine tomorrow.

- I don't think so.

I heard there's a storm coming.

- Brother!

380

Brother!

381

Father, mother.

Father, mother.

Both of them are dead!

- I was surprised.

385

People are more
solid than I thought.

- Huh?

387
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,880
- I thought it'd be like TV.

388
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,083
That I could easily slice
through them without a problem.

389
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,686
But it all ended up being
more difficult and noisy

390
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,287
than I expected.

It's been a long time since

sealed within its blade.

403

It creates a
symbiotic relationship

with the powers of
whomever is wielding it,

405

and its aura shifts
from handler to handler.

However, no matter
which attack I choose

I have no supernatural powers.
