You were really looking
forward to this!

325

You said there were
strong guys there.

326

- I took things too lightly.

guy could be such a monster.

To be honest,

I don't think I stand a
chance against him right now.

333

Right then, I realized
for the very first time

334
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,120
that there are guys out there

335

that are so ridiculously
strong that spirit and guts

just aren't gonna be enough
against an opponent like that.

it, that's so strange.

338
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:23,799
So Na-chan lost a fight, huh?

339
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,135
- And in a big freakin' way.

340
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,238
I wish there was some way
that you coulda seen it.

341

- [Chiaki] So now
what's Na-chan doing?

342
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:32,975
- [Bob] Dunno.

343

As far as I know,

344

this is the first time
he's ever lost a fight.

Probably singing the
blues somewhere about now.

is now just sitting there
all alone and getting cold.
