something about it.

If you want me to take
this dojo by force,

I got no problem with that.

we need to figure out
how we're gonna get

Didn't you say that
you had a lead?

He's a little souvenir
from my class.

He mentioned he wants to
be in the preliminaries.

And for the past
eight years now.

you've done, Shin.

You've allowed yourself to
place us into this grisly state.

Not only had you chosen
a dark and bleak life,

fight to preserve it.

an old abandoned katana,

bitterness and ugliness,

rusted from lack of use.

You choose to keep it
sheathed and let it rot away

and cannot bear the
sound of it being drawn.

You can't slay anything with it.

You just bat it at people as
if it were some kind of joke,

It seemed like a good
opportunity to take you out

around thinking that

I owe you one for doing this.

86

If you're not pulling

Same goes for you.

Drop your guard for a second

No, it's not like that at all.

It's just the twisted
way these two show they

Only the five final matches
are held down there.

the rules will be

Master Toudou.

Take a seat and pay attention.

117
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,494
- Hello, welcome, everyone.

118
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,697
You're all familiar
with Toudou's history.

119
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,866
It began in the early
days of the Meiji period.

120
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,969
The academy practiced
hundreds of styles back then,

121
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,771
maybe even thousands.

122
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,674
Those styles evolved into
their own organizations,

123
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:26,744
which developed the various
clubs we have today.

124
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:30,247
We currently have 96
different clubs on record.

125
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,350
The Executive Council was
created as a way to combine all

126
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,152
the different
groups together and,

127
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,388
guide the academy as a whole.

128
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,458
The club that wins
the preliminaries is
immediately crowned

129
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,459
the executive council.
- Hey I want to know

130
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,260
something.
- Like what?

131
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,230
- What is it that makes you
want to win this thing so badly?

132
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:48,933
You even went and
created a whole new club.

133
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:52,303
Is the president seat so cushy
you can't imagine leaving it?

134
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,537
- Don't be stupid.

135
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:54,905
It's nothing like that,

136
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,707
you try sitting in that chair.

137
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,710
- Well tell me why then?

138
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,131
[Master Toudou] Every
challenger that approaches them.

139
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,349
Club members should not only
fight for the teams honor

140
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,451
and beliefs but their own
honor and beliefs as well.

141
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,854
- Huh, you just lost me.

142
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,223
I'm not getting this
part of the rules at all.

143
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,325
- You're really overthinking
this whole thing.

144
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:17,261
It's pretty simple other
than each team having a total

145
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,796
of only five members.

146
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:22,266
There are absolutely no other
rules you need to worry about.

147
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,436
Fight anywhere you like
and everything's allowed,

148
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,905
from weapons to
hitting vital points.

149
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,541
You get to choose any
showdown you want.

150
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,043
- That is totally insane!

151
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,511
We're civilized folks!

152
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,681
We're just high school students!

153
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,617
- [Bunshichi] The opponents
and order we fight in

154
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,151
have already been determined.

155
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,587
You should've got a copy of
the breakdown the other day.

156
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,322
- That's so boring.

157
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,324
Why can't we just
fight anyone we want,

158
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,892
whenever we want to.

159
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,996
- Well, that doesn't seem like
a better plan to me my lady.

160
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,298
If it were like that, it'd be
a straight out death match.

161
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,234
- (chuckles) Last
year was the worst.

162
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,969
They were after us all the time.

163
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,571
We had guys from
the archery club

164
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,073
try to snipe us
from the roof tops.

165
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,241
- That's right.

166
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:05,176
Remember what
happened to Eyebrow

167
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,644
when he came out of class?

168
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,979
It was like he walked
into a hornet's nest.

169
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,247
- Totally!

170
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,683
- I suddenly
remembered something.

171
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,251
- Where do you
think you're going?

172
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,120
- Hey, come on man!

173

Let me go!

174
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,156

go anywhere at all.

Flake on us and I'll stress

you so hard that your hair
will come out in clumps.

Got that Scum?

178

- Hm, if you still want to run,

179
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:29,166
I think you'll have a hard
time running past these guys.

As far as our challengers
are concerned.

I believe they think that
this battle has already begun.

You guys are going down!

189
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,547
- You're going nowhere.

190

guard down, dammit!

Us old fogies can
sit back and watch.

- Hey, who are you calling old?

196
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,421
- So this is what the
preliminaries are all about.

197

- Kinda fun.
- Kinda fun.

This is what you've
been searching for.

You've found him at last.

203

The man who will
finally reduce you

Don't just stand
there, for all you know

I could've been some punk coming
up to stab you in the back.

won't happen again.

It's not that I'm
afraid of dying.

211

It's that I can't just
stand by and let him take

everything that I care about.

And in return leave
me with nothing.

I gotta go to the bathroom.

Forget it!

Go by yourself.

I get attacked on the way?

Nobody out there thinks
there's something to gain

one badass team.

What if this was the exact
point, that when touched

destroys your right arm
for the rest of your life?

What would you do?

see what happens?

Realize though if
you destroy my arm,

There, does it still hurt?

I've decided to put my plans
to fight you on hold for now.

282

I've realized that no
matter which approach I take

chances are you will still win.

284

I don't wanna lose anymore
than I've already have.

But if I do see a
time I can beat you

rest assured I'll
hold nothing back.

But until that day we're good.

I saw him take Shin
aside a few minutes ago.

at the bus stop the other day.

299
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,628
There was such a huge
commotion that broke out

300

that I'm afraid I was
unable to hear your answer.

You have to be here somewhere!

Answer me!

305
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,011
- We don't need
Shin to back us up.

306
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,680
We can handle things
just fine without him.

307
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:28,384
- Something about this is
starting to smell really bad.

308

I don't know why, but it
just doesn't sit right.

remember this blade.

310

It's the one Mana Kuzunoha
had taken away from you.

It's been eight years hasn't it.

That's when you first
picked up this blade.

Time sure does fly.

How did it feel when you
made your first killing?

319
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,689
Did you enjoy it?

320
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,765
You can feel free to kill
as much as you want today.

321
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:20,402
(laughs)
You have my permission.

322
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,304
- You, you can't be serious.

323
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,006
Master Dogen said that?

324
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,743
You mean, he really gave
Shin his permission.

325
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:30,279
This, this has to be a joke.

326
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,849
If he's allowed to reveal his
full powers here on campus.

327
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,150
Forget the preliminaries,

328
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,353
the entire school
will be in a panic.

329
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,888
- That's right Ms. Kuzunoha.

330
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,457
And that's precisely
what Master Dogen wants.

331
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,525
(Kuzunoha gasps)

332
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,093
You must realize,

333
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,629
that it's out of the shadows
of chaos and violence

334
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,098
that justice is born.
(flames crackling)

335
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:52,134
In order to finalize the
one true martial artist,

336
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:55,638
we must establish him as a
symbol of absolute justice.

337
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,740
And in order to do
that, there must first

338
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:01,044
be an unquestionable evil
that needs to be eliminated.

339
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:06,348
- It's round four now and I
don't want there to be any doubt

340
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,651
who the winner of this
match is all right.

341
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:11,987
I want there to be five
one-on-one battles.

342
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,455
We can hold it in this building

343
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,224
using five different classrooms.

344
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,026
Are you in?

345
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:19,795
- I don't care how we do it,
let's just get on with it.

346
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,730
- There's only four
of you guys right now.

347
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,666
Where's your captain at?

348
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,734
- I'll give you a freebie
and say we lost that one,

349
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,570
if that doesn't work for
you then I can fight twice.

350
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,206
- Let's get going!
- So, who am I being

351
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,242
paired with?
- Me.

352
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:36,545
- How's it going?

353
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,348
- All right, everybody
pick a class room now

354
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,683
and face your opponent.

355
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,692
- Just as I thought.

356
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:52,995
The old monster
doesn't even blink.

357
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,329
- You little punk!

358
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,098
Don't try to play games with me!

359
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,933
- Newsflash,

360
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:01,270
I like this school and I like
the person I've turned into.

361
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:02,638
I'm through.

362
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:05,240
I use to feel obligated
to follow your orders,

363
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,876
but those days
are long gone now.

364
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,545
We're done.

365
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:13,081
- Eight years ago when you
woke this power inside you

366
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:17,319
and went insane the 12 clans
gave an order to execute you

367
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,822
before you became to dangerous.

368
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,357
The very fact that you
are still alive today

369
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:25,627
is all because of me.

370
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:29,131
If that doesn't qualify as
a sense of obligation to you

371
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,566
then what does?

372
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,368
Or perhaps you're so
ungrateful you're willing to

373
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,836
destroy that too.

374
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:38,041
- Tell me, is everything
you do for your own benefit?

375
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,580
- [Fu Chi'en] You see Master
Dogen is the old fashion type.

376
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,949
He still believes 'til
this day that people can be

377
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,752
manipulated by things
like power and gratitude.

378
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:58,694
- Oh no!

379
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:10,139
- In the case of Shin Natsume
this is incredibly effective.

380
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,042
- These two are working together
as if they're one opponent.

381
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,846
They had to train together
for years to move like this.

382
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,148
- There are just a handful
of people who are privy to

383
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,616
this information.

384
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:24,820
But within this academy,
there's more than a dozen people

385
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:27,522
the Takayanagi Clan has
specifically placed here from

386

all over the country.

387
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,562
These people have
laded powers too.

388
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:36,598
And when their powers are
activated it will be the dawning

389
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,167
of a whole new day for us.

392

That was the chi of earth
found within the five elements.

393
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,280
Technically speaking,
it's something you can

394
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,883
find anywhere in the world.

395
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,486
It's energy from
the earth itself.

396
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:00,956
Don't look at me like
that Ms. Kuzunoha.

397
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,791
It isn't pretty.
