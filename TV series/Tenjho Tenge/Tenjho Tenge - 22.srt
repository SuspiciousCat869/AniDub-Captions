You hear it fine.

164

When a drop of rain falls from
the sky and hits the ground

it doesn't land
there just by chance.

that drop to hit it's mark.

One necessity merges
from another necessity.

Each time swelling
into a larger purpose.

Bit by bit the pieces
are being bound together.

Until the rush is so
strong it becomes a river.

That is destiny.

just listen to the rain.

But to understand the meaning
behind every single drop.
