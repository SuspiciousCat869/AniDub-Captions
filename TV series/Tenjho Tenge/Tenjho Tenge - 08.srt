(man groaning)

166
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,216
All right, here we are.

167
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,087
Aya's just up the
stairs on the rooftop.

168
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,522
- [Guy] Got it.

169
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:02,794
- Boy, go on without me,
you're on your own on this one.

170
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:04,961
Aya is probably fighting
the toughest battle

171
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,363
of her life right now,

172
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:08,398
but I have no strength
left to offer her.

173
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,300
- Well, what about
that Tagami guy?

174
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,235
Is he some sort of badass?

175
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:13,437
- Within the whole academy,

176
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,505
he's one of the top 10 students

177
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:20,143
but right now, it isn't Tagami
that Aya is going up against.

178
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,579
Right now, her challenger
is the colossal power

179
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,081
of the dragon's eye.

180
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:27,417
She must fight for her life
to escape its monstrous jaws.

181
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:30,420
This doesn't just happen
with the dragon's eye.

182
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,689
In front of any form
of enormous power,

183
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,225
one loses all sense of
their values and morals.

184
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,428
They are stripped from that
person and then tossed aside.

185
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,698
What remains is that
individual's true potential,

186
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,968
your opponent then
becomes yourself.

187
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,305
This is more than she
can handle right now.

188
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,843
What she needs is someone at
her side who can assist her.

189
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,414

(footsteps tapping)

192
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:14,064
Boy, this information
doesn't just pertain to Aya,

193
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,099
the time will come
when you must do battle

194
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,668
with your own self
and it will be fiercer

195
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,538
and nastier than
anyone else before you.

196

(electricity buzzing)

197
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,953
- [Aya] Souichiro-sama.

198
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,421
I defeated him,

199
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,925
he's one of the officers
from the executive council.

200
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,672
It's all right, I
don't think he's dead.

201
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,774
I hope not at least.

202
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,711
He must one of their
weaker officers.

203
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,179
His movements were so slow,

204
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,014
it barely seemed
like he was moving.

205
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,618
And his next attack
was always so obvious.

206
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,157
This was the first time
I've ever had this much fun

207
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,159
doing battle with someone.

208
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,161
I never knew that
punching another person

209
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,663
could be so exciting.

210
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,805
What I've done, is
really terrible, huh?

211
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,209
- Hey Aya, are you crying?

212
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,381
- Yes, I heard it.

213
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,819
I actually heard it.

214
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,489
(man screaming)

215
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,995
(Aya laughing)

(man yelling)

217
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:00,604
It never let up, I just
kept on hearing it!

218
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:04,942
The whole time, all I heard
was "stop, please stop".

219
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:08,178
But I didn't stop.

220
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,715
His muscles were torn and
his bones were shattered.

221
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:16,020
It was obvious that the
match was already over,

222
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,823
and yet, and yet I didn't stop.

223
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,594
The voice I heard was his
staff twisting in pain,

224
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:27,430
knowing that its master
was being destroyed,

225
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,399
my own voice was gone,

226
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,069
overcome by the power
of the dragon's eye.

227
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,872
This voice kept talking to me,

228
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:39,776
"Just use it, use the power
and the world's yours".

229
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,111
Then suddenly, my
opponent seemed like

230
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,213
nothing more than
an insect to me.

231
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:48,117
And the voice, the voice
kept telling me to kill it.

232
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:51,454
The next thing I
knew, I looked up

233
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,123
and he was, tell me!

234
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,427
What do I do, I could
have killed him!

235
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,961
I didn't mean for
this to happen!

236
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:02,131
The only thing I want is to
be with you Souichiro-sama.

237
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,635
(man yelling)

238
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,438

239
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,706
- He's still alive.

240
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,475
Tell me, was this the first time

241
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,178
you had a serious
fight against someone.

242
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,647
- Yeah, I think so.

243
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:20,817
- Well then, as someone who's
been in a whole lot of fights,

244
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,686
let me give you a
few words of advice.

245
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,190
Whenever I'm in a fight, I
only think about one thing.

246
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:30,661
Kill 'em, that's all
that I think about.

247
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:36,232
'Cause if I don't, I end
up getting my ass kicked.

248
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:39,503
Not by my opponent but by me.

249
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:45,141
See when you're in a fight,
it's the loser who pusses out.

250
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,343
Even if you pummel the
crap out of the guy,

251
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,145
if you puss out, you lose.

252
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,847
It doesn't matter how badly
your opponent beats you up,

253
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:55,384
as long as you stick with
it the entire time, you win.

254
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:58,222
That's the only rule that
matters in a serious fight.

255
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,558
You're gonna have to
remember that, Aya.

256
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:05,962
If you ask me, you're the
one who lost this fight.

257
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,763
Next time, win.

258
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,800
Win and enjoy it.

259
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,502
(thoughtful music)

260
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,238
- So, Souichiro-sama.

261
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,609
- [Woman] I think what
he was trying to say,

262
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,344
is that she needs
to be strong enough

263
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:22,912
to win against herself.

264
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,681
However, that was a rather
odd way of doing it,

265
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:28,751
but I guess that's what
I should expect from him.

266
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:31,821
- Your position sure doesn't
have a whole lot of perks,

267
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,090
does it Natsume?

268
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,393
They say stress can be
beauty's achilles heel,

269
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:41,063
be careful now,
don't push yourself.

270
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:42,798
- Well, this is unexpected.

271
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,700
So you're here as well, are you?

272
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,669
- Now just point those
tits some place else,

273
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,704
I don't give a damn
about those things.

274
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:50,339
I'm telling you
those tits of yours

275
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,808
have always been a
deadly weapon against me.

276
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,411
There's two things in this
world that render me powerless,

277
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,580
shitaki mushrooms and your tits.

278
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,750
- Hmph, I've had enough
of your sexual harassment.

279
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,918
If anything you
just said was true,

280
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,924
this would be no problem for
me at all, Bunshichi Tawara.

281
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,226
The battle between
the executive council

282
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,294
and us has never
interested you before.

283
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:15,264
So why show up at this
point in the game?

284
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:18,033
You a henchman for that
idiot Mitsuomi now?

285
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,769
Have you come here
to hunt us down?

286
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,671
Let me tell you this right now,

287
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,275
I won't let you lay a finger
on either one of them.

I don't know how far I
can go in this condition

289

but as the Juken club
currently stands,

chance against him.

last thing you're to do

school you go to.

luck, that's all it was.

Next time I'm not gonna lose.

I will win and I'll enjoy it.

But someday I'd like
for you to initiate

these kinds of things,
okay Souichiro-sama?

Oh, and about that
incident, you know,

where you were
kissing my sister?

that it, it wasn't anything.

I just, it's not what you think.

I'm worried about
Bob and Takayanagi,

the fight downstairs
concerns me, let's go!

335

this is the one thing I
don't intend to give up.

- Come on, Aya!

337
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:35,837
The boy had passed out
because he overextended

338

what little amount
of chi he had,

339
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,275
so I just gave him some
of mine to wake him up.

340
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:42,377
Nothing else
transpired between us,

341
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,880
you should have figured
that out on your own.

342
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:47,482
- Yes, I understand
what happened now

343
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,285
but the person who still
doesn't get it, is you sis.

344
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,753
- Huh?

345
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,989
- You always do this, you
seem like you know everything

346
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,558
but when it's really
important, when it's about you,

347
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,559
you're clueless.

348
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,563
So I'm just gonna
have to say it to you,

349
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll never let you take
Souichiro-sama from me.

350

Souichiro-sama, wait for me!

She's exactly like you
when you were younger.

354

355

if she didn't end up
the same way that I did.

356

That's why this bloody
battle mustn't be passed on

It has to end with us.

So what's it gonna be, are
you gonna fight or what?

- Me?

I think I'll pass,
don't like the pain.
