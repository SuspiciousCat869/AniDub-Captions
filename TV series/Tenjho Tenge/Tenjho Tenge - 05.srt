I have no doubt that Souichiro
Sama will start to hate me.

not nearly as fishy

170

Aren't you enjoying yourself?

I'm not bored or anything.

179
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,682
I think what's starting
to bug me is that,

180
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,251
is that I'd rather be practicing
