Hurry up, he might still

stich up his abdomen

he'll recover without a problem.

You'll see.

I'm afraid you're not
going to be able to make it

fretting over something

You're Mana Kuzunoha.

get too worked up over this.

345
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,223
Shin was going easy on him.

346
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:10,159
If I didn't show up he
still wouldn't have died.

347
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,062
Providing, of course, that
he was taken to a hospital.

348
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,198
- Yeah, but the attack he
used was a Tashinko attack

349
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,201
that rips through muscles
with just a finger.

350
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:21,270
That move attacks
the internal organs,

351
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,338
especially the liver.

352
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,539
It's a killer.

353
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,575
You're not taking it
easy by using that move.

354
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,044

The Takayanagi clan,

Who would've thought?

359
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,221
- You'd be even more surprised

360
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,390
if you met my little
brother, Masataka.

361

That guy's even nicer than I am.

362
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:45,528
Or, maybe, he just
seems that way

363
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,464
'cause he's always
daydreaming. (laughs)

364

available after school today?

- Yeah, I guess.

But are you sure that's
gonna be all right?

367
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,407
Shin can get really
jealous sometimes.

368
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,242
If he catches wind that
his girlfriend and me

alone together (laughs).

- You're getting a lot stronger

372
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:11,053
but your attacks are
still all over the place.

373
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,022
You gotta learn when
it's time to attack

374
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:13,957
and time to hold back.

375
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,457
- All right, that's enough.

376
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,060
- It's not enough, this is
something really important.

377
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,462
That type of fighting may be
good enough for middle school,

wanna hear anymore!

I'm tired of you treating
me like a little girl.

Don't tell me that even

You said earlier that

Well it's always like that.

He always makes bad choices

If he didn't have me around

love with each other
