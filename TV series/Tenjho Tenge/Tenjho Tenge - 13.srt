Someone's taken a

nothing I can do about it.

of my brother?

Even a guy of your caliber?

Now why don't lead
me to where Shin is?

What's wrong? Is there something

That's how you wanna play.

Did he?

- We don't want anything
to do with you anymore.

41

It's best if you don't show
your faces around us again.

He did, didn't he?

any money again today.

I guarantee you the boss is
gonna get on my case again.

Yes, finally some money.

I can't deal with this.

I'll complain to

me where you want me to go.

Oh please, don't get me

Just take me to this location.

Miss Isuzu inside that car,

screw around on me.

beyond all belief.

This buddy I'm talking about

So desperate.

Such a waste.

He's nothing more than a

00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,481
It called out to me.

00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:12,736
what do you do?

162
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,305
How long can you tell yourself

163
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,507
this isn't what you know it is?

164
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:19,843
If I could have stayed
blind to it all,

165
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,746
I wouldn't have to face
this kind of pain right now.

166
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:26,750
But unfortunately, I got
the same luck you do.

167
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,986
And I started noticing
those signs, too.

168
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,892
- Well, mister, you better win.

169
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,435
- All right now.

170
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:23,306
Yo, Shin, I've been
looking for you.

171
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,008
- Well, hello there.

172
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,311
Whatever brings you
here, Bunshichi?

173
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,679
You know, people just think

174
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,881
of the cleverest
things, these days.

175
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,216
With this thing here,

176
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,453
wherever you decide
to go, I can find you.

177
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,954
- Yes, that's a receiver.

178
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:40,256
The protocol is to keep at
least three transmitters

179
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:41,625
on his body at all times.

180
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,159
- Shut up!

181
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,062
Listen here, you ugly bitch,
I got nothing to say to you.

182
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:48,299
- Ugly bitch?

183
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,434
Fu Chen, why did you allow him

184
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,969
to come all the way out here?

185
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,505
I stressed to you earlier the
importance of this meeting,

186
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,773
what were you thinking?

187
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,876
- I do apologize, Miss Kuzunoha.

188
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,178
However, I just couldn't help

189
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,182
but feel that there's something
exceptional about this one.

190
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,218
I do hope that you
will forgive me.

191
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,386
- For some feeling?

192
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:11,121
You ignored your assignment?

193
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,489
- I hate to bring this up,

194
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,057
but isn't the reason
we're here today

195
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,092
because you didn't
show enough discretion

196
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:19,229
in handing that memory
card over to Mr. Mitsuomi?

197
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,231
Is it not because
of this careless act

198
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,634
that this one was also able to
view the images on that card?

199
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:27,303
And wasn't that what forced
us to put surveillance

200
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,372
on him as well?

201
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,108
I'm just giving you a hard time.

202
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,410
But I really don't
see the problem.

203
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,546
If the two of them
want to go at it,

204
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,615
then let them do it.

205
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,117
They're both students
at the Toudou academy,

206
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:43,620
so then they're our
guinea pigs, correct?

207
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:46,422
And besides, these two are fated
to go up against each other

208
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,825
sooner or later anyway.

209
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:49,826
- Fu Chen!

210
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:58,468
- Shin, tell me, what in the
hell was that Chinese guy

211
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,070
babbling about just now?

212
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,041
What's that look mean?

213
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,643
Are you saying that
you're fully aware

214
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,546
of everything that
they've been doing?

215
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,651
Come on, answer me, damn it!

216
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,788
(laughter)

217
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:46,150
- Bunshichi, you know,
sometimes you really bug.

218
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,086
I've been playing along
with your best buddy scheme

219
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,421
this whole time,

220
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,622
then you get worked up

221
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,824
and decide to come
all the way out here?

222
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:57,127
Who the hell do you think
you are to judge me?

223
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:04,267
- Master, it's dangerous,
please take cover!

224
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,501
- What the hell's going on?

225
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,070
- His presence is
totally changed,

226
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,138
it's a completely different guy!

227
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,139
- Yes.

228
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,389
- Toudou Academy senior and
executive council president,

229
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,126
Shin Natsume is ready to fight.

230
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,299
- Guess I'll be
fighting someone else.

231
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,073
- Miss Kuzunoha.

232
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,645
Why in the world did she
decide to approach me?

233
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:53,149
Why would she want me to
see something like that?

234
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,419
I've got so many
questions and no answers.

235
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,323
But none of that seems
to matter anymore.

Endlessly deep and dark.

238

He's crawled up from
the darkest alleys

239

That serpent called fear.

- So that's the dragon
eye they talk about.

243
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,115

from punishment time

244
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,550
to some serious
monster killing time.

245

(knuckles cracking)

246
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,228
- Is that kid really
thinking about fighting him?

247
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,163
He'll kill him!

248
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,730
- What style does he use?

249
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,198
- He doesn't have one.

250
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,168
Closest description would be
reckless street fighting style.

251
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:21,770
However, there's not a
student in the whole school

252
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,373
who's ever won a
fight against him.

253
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:27,377
He's the strongest
ordinary person at Toudou.

254
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:55,438
- You son of a bitch!

255
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,653
I'm not losing it.

256
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,155
I know what he's trying to do.

257
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,261
- What's the matter, Bunshichi?

258
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:24,166
You look like somebody just
snapped your body in half.

259
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,735
- Such a strong and
ominous presence.

260
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,504
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's just seen

261
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:31,407
a clear vision of
himself being slain.

262
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:34,143
If Shin were serious,
he would have killed him

263
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:35,611
in two seconds.

264
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:37,613
- You freaking asshole!

265
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:39,848
- He has an enormous
handicap as it is,

266
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,850
fighting someone with a katana,

267
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,119
but an opponent with
the dragon's eye

268

and the chokuto reiki,

269
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:49,491
isn't this what you refer to
in your language as bullying?

270
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:50,993

271
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,694
Watch him closely.

272
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,230
You've been in fights
with bad odds before.

into striking range,

275
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:01,570
a katana really
isn't all that scary.

276
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,573
I just gotta risk my
life to get there.

involves risking their lives.

279
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,115
A bad habit to get into.

If that's what you're
willing to do to win,

why do you even
need martial arts?

That's just a reality.

So powerful that he can
