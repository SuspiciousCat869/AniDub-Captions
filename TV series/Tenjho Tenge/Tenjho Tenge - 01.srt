Pretty impressive track record.

For a master of my caliber,

physical control at this level
is simply a piece of cake.

I'm afraid that I'm
very busy today.

about him at all.

181

He's a lot tougher
than he may look.

A fall from this height

What I'm concerned
about is that room.

the best way to put it?

destiny can be quite cruel.

- [Lunch Lady] You got it.

330
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,259

331

and right about then,

332
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:41,197
the irises in the school
pond began to open.

333

If being dumped on the same day

that I fall in love is destiny,

335

Each and every single

I don't believe you!

You act as if one little
bite is going to kill you!

and that means it will.

me another one for now?

I didn't even know it.

No thanks, if you really are
looking to make it up to me,

would you please tell him

to try Aya's homemade
lunch at least once.

good with girls.

378

He's being a bit shy.

379
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,320
See, he likes to think of
himself as a tough guy.

380
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,622
Just take him with
a grain of salt.

- If there's something you
want to talk about hurry up.

384
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,466
I would like to be
able to eat my meal

know how many people

this school's got that
are as tough as you are,

and I also wanna
know their names.

389

I'm sure that midget
girl is probably one,

390

but I don't think she
makes the top of the list.

391
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:44,953
I've got this strange feeling

392
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:47,456
that this school is full
of all kinds of monsters

393
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:50,325
that are much more
dangerous than she is.

Am I wrong?

396
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,366
- Well am I wrong in
assuming that you're aware

397
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,335
of the whole history
behind the Toudou Academy?

398
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:03,138
- Well, I know all
the basic stuff.

399
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:06,041
- The Toubou school is what
this academy evolved from.

400
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,010
It was created to
revive the martial arts

401
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,278
that had begun to fade away

402
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,914
with the collapse
of the Shogunate.

403
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,784
Toudou Academy follows
the same legacy

404
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,719
of that Toubou school.

405
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,888
So, what you've got
is a school built

406
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,957
to revive martial arts.

407
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,227
Of course there's gonna
be tough people here.

408
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:29,331
- Yeah but there's
still top dogs, right?

409
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,266
- Well, what would
you do if I told you?

410
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,335
- We'd go and rip them apart.

What did you expect?

413

- Hey Nagi, so you finally
shook her off your tail.

414
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,743
- Seems like it.

415
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:43,779
- Listen, nobody at this
school is interested

416
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,582
in such trivial things as
trying to take it over.

417
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,417
There's absolutely
no reason for you two

418
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,052
to keep trying to pick a fight.

419
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,621
- Of course there is, dumb ass.

420
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,423
There is nothing more exciting,

421
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,292
than the chance to
fight a tough guy.

422
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,996
Don't you ever get excited?

423
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:04,132
I couldn't care less what
my opponent stands for,

424
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,803
but if he happens to be a tough
guy then I'm fighting him.

425
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,005
Don't you feel the same?

426
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,541
- At this point I realized
my assessment of these two

427
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,176
had been completely wrong.

428
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,778
In fact I couldn't have
been more off the mark.

429
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,080
- Come to think,

430

I have a score to settle
with you, remember?

431
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:24,419

but your issue isn't with me,

432

but with Maya.

Huh.
