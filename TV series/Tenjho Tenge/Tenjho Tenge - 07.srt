I'll call for
someone to help you.

here in 10 minutes,

up there myself.

You are excused now.

- Will you just hurry
up and leave already?

68
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,195

until your clothes

shreds like that.

So, what do you think

You heard what he said.

79

He's arrived and that means

the smallest chance

win this fight now.

precise location.

I can eliminate
most of the pain.

with this injury.

No matter how hopeless
this situation gets,

I am the captain of that club,

Is what I did
really that amazing?

106
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,316
- Reuka Kiko Tanshinko.

107
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,285
It's a type of attack
that is executed

108
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,454
by utilizing hatke.

109

Look boy, what do you see here?

110

- I don't see nothing.

111

112
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,961
Well there's something
quite close to us

113
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,264
that can be of great
value to you and me.

114
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,132
- [Boy] Huh?

115
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,666
- [Maya] The atmosphere.

116
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,268
Atmosphere is an
essential element

117
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,670
that this world is filled with.

118
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,573
Don't think of a circle
as motion, but as power.

119
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,275
Many martial arts use circles

120
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,877
within fundamental
areas for good reason.

121
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,847
It's also used by
masters in their attacks.

122
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,582
The backhand is
basically a method

123
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,484
of conveying the impact point.

124
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,553
In other words, as long
as you have something

125
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,121
to transfer your power,

126
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,323
you can use it against anything.

127
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,225
As one's turning force builds,

128
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:37,361
it uses chi to evolve from
a slicing circular motion

129
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,197
into a lean linear motion

130
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,632
with an amazing amount
of kinetic energy.

131
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:44,169
And then that energy
begins to rush.

132
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,071
- Can I take back what I said?

133
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,440
How about I start the
attack on this one?

134
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,641
- Denied.

135
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,510
- [Maya] Building
within the atmosphere.

136
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,379
(shattering)

137
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,848
- [Sagara] Such a
devastating force.

138
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,183
Many times have I fought against

139
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,485
the most fearsome of opponents.

140
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,022
But never have I seen
an attack like this.

141
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:07,825
- Hey, what the?

142
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,328
How come my attack
didn't reach him?

143
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,762
- [Sagara Voiceover]
He missed me.

144
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:14,399
This means he hasn't
fully mastered the attack.

145
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,402
- That's not how
it's done, you idiot!

146
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,572
An attack that you just
learned earlier today, boy,

147
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,542
is not going to work
against these challengers.

148
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,477
Lose that thought now.

149
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,479
In the end, the martial
arts are nothing more

150
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,048
than a series of attacks
used to defeat people.

151
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,584
You should know how to
choose your attacks wisely.

152
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,554
If not, you'll just become a
victim of your own efforts.

153
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,557
Now tell me, what
are you made of, boy?

154
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,927
You have your own way
of fighting, don't you?

155
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,562
You didn't come
knocking on our door

156
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,665
because you wanted to be a
martial artist now, did you?

157
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,634
There is more than one
path to achieving strength.

158
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:54,972
- Man, you guys are
like a broken record.

159
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,075
I already know that I
ain't no martial artist.

160
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,644
I know damn well
who the hell I am.

161

Yes, you are incredibly strong.

But not everyone that
you associate with

And if you honestly plan

train relentlessly

this only for the safety

keep order within the school.
