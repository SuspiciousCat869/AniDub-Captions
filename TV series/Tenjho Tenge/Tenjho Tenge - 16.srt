- She's right.

161
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,865
Looks like we're gonna have
our hands full for a while.

162
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,670
- Miss Natsume, could I
please have a word with you?

163
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,039
- Good morning, nice to
see you, Master Toudou!

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,841
- What's this old dude about?

165
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,342
- He's the Master, bonehead.

166
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,711
In other words, he's the
principle of the whole academy.

167
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,580
- This matter is
quite important.

168
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,483
I'm sure you know
what it entails.

169
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,587
- Don't worry, it's no big deal.

170
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:17,655
After you, sir.

171
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,491
Oh, one last thing.

172
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,360
Don't be late, I have something
important to go over later.

173
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,663
So please be on time for
our meeting everyone.

Looks like we don't gotta
worry about any freshmen

179

wanting to go up
against us anymore!

180
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,020
They're all too scared.

181
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,323
- Could you try and play
it a little cooler, maybe?

182
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,061
Good news, looks like
there's still a few guys

183
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,764
left to this school with a
decent pair of balls on them.

184
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:01,765
- Yeah.

185
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,303
- They're already at it again.

186
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,840
Their challenger is the Master
of the Hokushin Ito style.

187
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,377
I believe that boy's name is
Kanakita, third Kendo Club,

188
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,946
and that young man is
their new rising star.

189
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,147
Almost this whole club

190
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,082
was involved in the
bowling alley incident.

191
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,317
And nearly half was sent

192
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,586
to the hospital
afterwards to recover.

193
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,355
Same thing happened to
several of the other clubs.

194
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,624
I'm afraid we're gonna
have a lot more incidents,

195
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,860
like that one there.

(signing)

197
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,498
What do you purpose
we do, Miss Natsume?

198
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,734
- It started with Ryuuzaki.

199
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,674
I handed him a rather
crushing defeat.

200
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,309
Because of the orders
he carried out,

201
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,411
on behalf of the
Executive Counsel.

202
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,746
That angered the
counsel, and as a result

203
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:52,649
it created this war, that
you see going on now.

204
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,951
All of this is
actually my fault.

205
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:55,952
- Hmm.

206
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,322
- Although not
everyone would be happy

207
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,590
if I were to receive
some form of punishment.

208
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,726
It would at least keep fights
like that one over there

209
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,394
from breaking out everyday.

210
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,395
What do you think?

211
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,066
- Well, the masters are
conferring right now

212
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,601
to make that very same
decision, Miss Natsume.

213
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,603
You may wait here
until they're done,

214
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:15,105
and in the meantime,

215
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,708
you may want to
consider preparing
yourself for the worst.

216
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,876
- Well, look at
who we have here.

217
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:22,979
I hope you two are in the mood
for a good beating, today.

218
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,948
I'm going to give you
guys a little gifts.

219
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,919
I'd hate for people to say
I had unfair advantage.

220
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,154
- Is this your
attempt at Bushido?

221
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,622
- That was really dumb.

222
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,624
I know you think you're
being all warrior-like

223
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,493
but you just lost the
only chance you had

224
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:37,828
at winning this fight.

225
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,362
- No, no, no, no, boys.

226
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,533
I'm afraid the advantage
is in my hands.

227
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,870
Because I'm fighting
with a real Katana,

228
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,039
I'll do my best
while defeating you

229
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,107
to avoid any vital parts.

have any balls at all.

231

This little freak's too scared

232
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,280

the sooner this will end.

236

Resistance will only cause pain.

237

Do something about
this crazy kappa.

- Yeah, well, why
don't you do it?

242
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:30,313
- No way, you're the one
that has some special attack

243

That Tahitian something,

244
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,851
you can pull that attack
off long range, can't ya?

245
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,486
- Oh, yeah, right!

246

But it takes takes time for me

247

to build up enough
chi to use that thing.

248
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,458
So the only way we
can use this attack,

249
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,560
is if you buy me some
time by risking your neck

thing off as an accident.

Even if your opponent

against a larger mass
and a stronger power

it will be rendered useless.

The way those two boys have
improved is impressive,

They are both so talented and
their potential is limitless.

All of this is coming to
fruition now, not because of me,

288

but because of their
recent battles.

I know this could
never really happen,

years earlier, you know,

even if they'd come to the
school just one year earlier,

Shoplift from the student
store or something?

as you are, you idiot!

something to do with this?

I've been expecting this
decision for quite some time.

302

To tell you the
truth I found it odd

303
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,369
they waited this
long to do something

304

about the run-ins we've had
with the Executive Council.

305

They were good enough
to grant me one request.

306
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:47,810
I asked for a grace period
before the expulsion begins,

307

and they agreed.

308

For now I can come to school
for the rest of the semester.

With that said, there's
barely a month left

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,600
- Is the Executive Council
going to accept that decision?

317
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,070
- Yeah.

318
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,538
- As you wish.

319
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,742
But sir, do you really feel
that she got what she deserved?

320
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,147
- Okay, so the Daijo
style is still regarded

321
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:27,049
as the oldest
hand-to-hand combat method

322
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,484
used in our country.

323
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,119
People use to refer
to it as the root

324
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,088
of many of the popular styles.

325
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,857
However, look at something
like fast-kick sumo wrestling

326
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,525
and the moves from
the Kungu type method

327
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:37,827
as shown in Kojiki,

328
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,963
and this theory doesn't
really stand up.

329
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,069
It's a nice day out
today, isn't it, boy?

330
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,538
I was surprised you finally
showed up to one of my lectures,

331
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,308
but it turns out you
only came to sun-tan.

332
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,077
Can you tell me what I was
just discussing with the class?

333
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,512
- Well, maybe if
I'd been listening,

334
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,914
I'd have a frigging clue.

335
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:00,950
- Now, look what you've done.

336
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,353
You just caused damage
to school property.

337
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,089
So tell me, are
you still thinking

338
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,658
about disrespecting me now, hmm?

339
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,926
You mouth off again

340
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,096
and the property of your
face will get destroyed.

341
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:17,900
- Dude, can get your finger
out from under my nose?

342
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:22,271
I don't mean to be rude, but
it kind of smells like jizz.

343
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:23,106
- What?

344
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,908
(classroom chuckles)

345
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,210
- You sure do have
some nerve, there kid.

346
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,880
- Just give it a
rest, Souichiro.

347
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:33,082
- I feel sorry for Natsume,

348
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,652
that girl took an exposition
to protect lowlifes like you.

349
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,255
Do you at least feel guilty?

350
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,359
You're thinking of
taking me on, huh?

351
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,294
If you think the
Masters of this Academy

352

are just ordinary teachers,

Hey, is that really true?

360
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,956
The stuff you said
about our Captain?

361
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:22,065
Do you really think she
was trying to protect us?

362

Hey look its a kite,
no wait that a crow?

Check it out, what
do you think that is?

364
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,210
- Well whatever it is, its
squawking so you figure it out.

365
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,313
You know, this whole
thing might end up

366
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:41,183
being a perfect opportunity
for me in the end.

367

Chiaki's been getting a
little freaked out lately

368

and I don't want to bail on her.

too, it's my mom.

You know, she never even thought

371
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,927
that I'd make it to high school.

372

Few hours after I got
the acceptance letter,

373
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:56,331
I caught her fighting
back the tears.

374
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:58,700
- Well, we just got
to stay on our toes.

375
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:01,370
- Yeah, well, I've been
doing that all along.

(bird squawking)

377
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,243
I don't think she has any idea

378
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,180
how much I try to
look out for her.

379
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,752
- Is something wrong?

380
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,088
- Nope, it's all good.

Hey, Bob, you know I think
that thing is a crow.

- No, shit.

384
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,373
I need to know,
are you mad at me?

385
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:40,709
If you wanted me to defeat him,

386
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,279
then I just passed up a
perfect chance to do it.

387
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:51,753
But, I couldn't
even move a muscle.

I'm sorry if I let you down.

I've tried my best in
the last two years,

but I can't avenge your death.

defeat Mitsuomi after all.
