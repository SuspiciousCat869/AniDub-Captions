[SENKU] We've cleared all
the hurdles, and finally,

6
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:26,525
our ultra-marathon science

[SENKU] We've come
so ridiculously far.

00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:20,233
Now, in the middle of this
primitive Stone World,

12
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,817
The most powerful weapon
of modern warfare

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
is one that shoots voices
over infinite distances.

[ALL cheering]

Our voices'll dance

And they'll travel far
into the distance.

19
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,733
Kinda weird to think about.

20
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,150
Sure is.

21
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,733
It's amazing that we can
send our voices out so far.

22
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:00,358
But I wonder how anyone
will be able to hear them.

23

Oh, whoopsie! Guess we're
gonna need another one.

00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,608
You kept quiet about that
on purpose, didn't you?

27
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,817
'Cause if everyone knew
we needed two of 'em,

28
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,067
they may've been less
willing to help out.

29
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,358
[SENKU]
Heh-heh.

30
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,775
We will need to make another one

31
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,275
for it to work as a
proper cell phone.

32
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,567
But if we run a long cable,

33
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,317
it should function sorta
like a landline.

34
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:50,400
So, if I just talk into this
thing, Ruri will hear me?

Ahem!

00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,442
Hey, Chrome, getting to
speak the first words

38
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,400
through the phone is
a pretty big deal.

00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,067
So, what're you gonna say?

40
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,483
[CHROME]
Hm?

00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,858
Ruri is listening

Ya know, this is

It's crazy.

That was definitely Chrome's

I don't get it at all.

How can something so
tiny talk like that?

60
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,608
It's almost like
a speaker, huh?

61
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,525
It's not almost like
a speaker, it is one.

62
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:12,442
With microphones and speakers,

63
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,650
sounds convert to
electricity and back again.

Ruri... what you
said just now...

00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,650
"Almost like a speaker"?

66
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,442
Yeah, a speaker!

67
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,983
So is this a bee or what?

68
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,400
Wow, this thing is
exactly like a bee!

69
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:31,400
Uh. How is a speaker like a bee?

70
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,733
Well, I mean,

71
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:35,858
I thought speakers were
a certain variety of bee.

72
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,650
What gave you that idea?

73
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:38,942
Uh.

74
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:41,400
The fact that it was in
the Hundred Tales?

75
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,108
You're saying it
was passed down?

76
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:48,275
Yeah. In Tale 14.
It's a wonderful little story.

77
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:53,358
It centers around an extremely
talkative bee called Speaker.

78
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,900
And when he pokes
gravestones with his needle,

79
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,942
he's able to speak in
the voices of the dead

80
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,150
and tell their stories.

81
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,067
So there's a speaker,
needle on a gravestone,

82
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,275
and dead voices?

83
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,400
That tale isn't transferring
any actual knowledge,

84
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,900
so I don't quite
understand its purpose.

85
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,525
What could it be?
It's izarre-bay.

86
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,317
The tale uses the word "speaker"
to communicate something

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
only those from our
time would understand.

88
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,400
Plus, the tale's number
is 14, or rather 1-4.

89
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:30,525
The date of... Stone Day.

I should've realized this
a whole lot earlier.

00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,192
The old man sure loved
being a pain in the ass.

102
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,858
Like these would just be
the founders' gravestones.

That's way too simple for him,

so it's obviously ten
billion percent bull.

This thing isn't a gravestone.
It's a time capsule.

That's impossible.

There's no way you

[KOHAKU] I'm so confused.
How does it work?

151

Actually, the way it works
is ridiculously simple.

Eally-ray ad-bay!

153
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,067
[SENKU] You use sound
to vibrate a needle,

154
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,567
which digs grooves
into the record.

155
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,858
If you run a needle over
those grooves, it'll vibrate,

156
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,442
and that reproduces
the original sound.

Eally-ray ad-bay!

Oh-ho! I never

Not him. He's cool,
but Byakuya didn't do it.

It had to've been the people

[SENKU] Astronauts are
some of the world's

Except for my old man,
who got in on luck.

167
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,692
Though it is possible that
he came up with the idea.

168
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,692
He would've thought of
something as goofy as this.

169
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,150
I bet if all of us put
our minds to it,

170
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,233
we could make a record
outta this thing.

Yeah, that's not a bad idea!

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,025
And glass is a whole lot
more durable than plastic.

173

If it's preserved properly,

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,192
it could last for
thousands of years.

Wow. I guess that's
why you suggested it.

Oh, I didn't know.

177
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,900
Kinda just thought it might work
for that because it's round.

Why didn't you just pretend
you already knew that, old man?

Well, this is the plan.

[SENKU]
We can make a record player.

Should be easy if we use some
of the stuff we've made so far.

We'll use the gear from

I went and grabbed it for ya.

And that right there
is how people

become cogs in society
as they get older.
