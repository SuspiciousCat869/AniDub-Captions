[SENKU chuckling]

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,483
[SENKU] It's finally starting
to look like a place

4
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,025
fit for an actual human.

5
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:31,858
Okay.

6
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:34,650
To be honest, I don't think
I can keep hitting "ignore"

7
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:37,442
on my exhaustion
for too much longer.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,400
[SENKU]
Damn.

9
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:46,608
I had no idea it was this hard
to keep just one person alive.

10
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:49,567
There's no time for
scientific progress.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,692
What I wouldn't give to have
someone with brute strength

12
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,275
and stamina to handle
the grunt work.

13
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,400
[SENKU]
I've got a hunch about this one.

14
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:03,900
It's close to where
I broke free,

15
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,817
so it's highly probable
that we drifted

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,358
from approximately
the same location.

17
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:11,525
These crazy-strong hands
are just what I need.

Although I do get a little sick

21
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,942
of looking at his stupid face,

22
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:27,900
I think 3,700 years may've
been enough of a break.

23
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:30,650
Hey, ya big oaf.

24
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:35,358
All right, time to get started
on Senku Lab's first project.

25
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:36,900
So tell me, meathead,

26
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:39,817
what'll it take to get you
to wake up like I did?

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,483
[SENKU]
Maybe the bigger question is,

28
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,650
what exactly was it that
turned all of humanity

29
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,442
to stone 3,700 years ago?

30
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,150
Hypothesis number one...

31
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,525
[ALIEN A]
Dude, earthlings are so lame.

32
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,483
Let's turn 'em into stone.

33
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,233
[ALIEN B] It did work on those
pesky swallows! Petri-ray!

34
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,733
[ALIEN A]
Ha! Get excited!

[SENKU]
Hypothesis number two...

36
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:07,608
Ha-ha! The petrification
doom-ray is finally ready!

37

[TAIJU screaming]

It got us as well!

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,608

Hypothesis number three...

40
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,692
[ALL laughing]

41
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,608
We're the petricoccus virus!

42
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:21,775
Only humans and swallows
are vulnerable to our power!

43
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,400
He-he! Get excited!

44
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,650
[TAIJU screaming]

45
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,525
[SENKU]
The only thing I'm sure of,

46
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:29,775
is whatever caused this

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:34,317
targeted humans and
swallows specifically.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,692
It seems like fantasy,
but in reality,

49
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,650
there's an underlying rule.

50
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,733
Which means I can solve it.

51
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:45,150
Discovering these hidden rules
is what science is all about.

52
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,358
[SENKU] Right now, I'm
starting down a new path.

53
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,775
An uncharted branch of science.

54
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,942
Get excited, Senku.

55
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,525
[SENKU]
What did it?

56
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,858
What caused me to break
out of my petrified state?

57
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:02,358
Was it simple deterioration?

58
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:03,900
If that were the case,

59
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,025
the outside surface
exposed to the elements

60
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:09,650
would be the first
to break down.

61
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,067
But the petrified people
are like statues,

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,692
stone all the way through.

63
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,108
For me, it was like a shell,
the outside was stone,

64
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,358
and the inside changed
back to living cells.

65
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,233
[gasps]

66
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,942
[SENKU]
It's the other way around!

67
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,400
The surface was deteriorated

68
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,483
and couldn't revert
to the living cells.

69
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,858
It became a stone husk!

70
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,025
The parts of the surface
that were less petrified

71
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,358
turned back to cells.

72
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,525
That's why that reconstructed
shell has holes in it.

73
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:41,358
[SENKU] So I wasn't revived due
to deterioration or erosion.

74
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,983
There's some outside
X factor in play.

75
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,733
The fragments ended
up in a pile,

76
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,358
with the ones closest to
my head on the bottom.

77
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:52,150
Which means the revival
started at the top.

78
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,775
[SENKU] There's gotta
be something in there.

79
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,025
[SENKU]
Smells like nitric acid.

80
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,442
That's it!

81
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,692
[SENKU] The back of my
neck is still petrified.

82
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:25,067
[SENKU]
Time for a quick experiment.

Huh?

00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,525
[grumbles]

87
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:15,400
[SENKU] Why did nitric
acid only work on me?

88
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,983
It's not making one millimeter
of progress on Taiju

89
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,358
or anyone else.

90
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,942
There's gotta be an answer.
What makes me different?

91
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,733
[SENKU]
Think.

92
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:30,108
I just need a
working hypothesis.

93
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,650
Come on, Senku, think!

94
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,775
[gasps]

95
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:37,483
[SENKU]
That's it! I was thinking!

96
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,942
For the entire 3,700
years I was petrified,

97
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,400
I remained conscious.

98
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,733
The human brain burns
through 400 calories a day.

99
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:48,608
Over 3,700 years,

100
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:51,358
that works out to two
terajoules of energy.

101
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:54,775
But where did all that
energy come from?

102
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:57,650
E equals mc squared.

103
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,567
Energy and mass have
equivalent exchange.

104
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,567
Old Man Einstein expressed
a basic scientific truth

105
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,025
with that equation.

106
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:09,233
It tells us that we can't
create energy from nothing.

107
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,192
There's something in the stone
itself that I was consuming.

108
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,567
That's how I had the
energy to use my brain.

109
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,733
Finding out what that was

110
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:19,483
is the key to undoing
the petrification.

111
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,650
I gotta try everything.

112
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,942
Every experiment I can think of.

113
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,733
I'd love to get my
hands on some kind

114
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:30,983
of industrial-strength
etching agent, like nital.

115
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:35,108
Ugh. But I need
alcohol to make that.

116
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:39,150
Gotta believe.
And try, try, try.

117
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,900
Keep trying everything
I can possibly think of.

118
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,108
And then try some more.

119
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,942
[SENKU]
Never forget.

120
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:55,150
Petrification may
seem like a fantasy...

121
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:58,525
...but the foundations
of science are rock solid.

122
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,608
[SENKU]
I need manpower!

123

and get up already!

there, aren't ya?

You've been awake for
this entire damn time!

127
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,567
You and I are no
different in that regard!

128
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,775
You don't know when
to give up either!

129
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,692
Hey, Senku!

130
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,150
Come on!

131
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,067
Taiju.

132
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,900
[BOTH] I'll wait for you
however long it takes!

133
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:38,067
Because I can't do
this without you!

134
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,317
So please come back, Taiju!

135

Please, come back!
Please, Senku!

136
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,442
The storm. It's over.

137
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,567
[SENKU]
That thunderstorm was providing

138
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,567
some serious cover for us,

139
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,942
so keep your voices
down from here on out.

140
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:37,442
Because if Tsukasa hears us,
it's game over for real.

the thing with my neck.

I barely even gave you
any real hints about it.

147
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,067
Taiju, Yuzuriha, I believe
that kind of thinking

148
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,692
should snag you
ten billion points.

149
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:45,608
Senku?

That killer tried to
painlessly sever my spine,

00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:54,817
but you'd crush my whole body?

154

Let go!

155

You know I'm not the type
of guy who does the whole

"emotional, teary-eyed
gratitude" kinda thing,

157

so don't expect that.

Yeah. Welcome back, Senku.

Does that look like
a rocket ship to you?

162
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,275
There's a buncha stars, too!

163
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,067
[SENKU]
Yeah, no. I'm not seein' it.

164
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,192
[YUZURIHA]
It's a "science flag,"

165
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:32,067
and I think it's perfect
for you, Senku!

166
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,608
It can even help your neck!

167
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,733
Great idea!

168
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,317
And now you have a splint, see?

169
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,317
Ten-billion percent sure
I don't need this.

170
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,358
I'm perfectly fine, okay?

171
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,358
Professor Senku
volunteered his body

172
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,025
and the experiment
was a great success.

173
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,275
The restorative effects
of de-petrification

174
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,400
are really incredible.

175
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,942
[laughs]

176
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,483
First we thought turning to
stone ruined everyone's lives,

177
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,317
but I guess it kinda saved
yours this time, huh?

178
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,233
It's like what you were
saying when we made soap.

179
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,900
The de-petrification,

180
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,858
it's a lifesaver in a
time without doctors.

181
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,150
It's Doctor Stone!

182
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:20,775
[SENKU] Yeah. Come to
think of it, it is pretty odd.

183
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,442
When the petrification
is undone,

184
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,400
the affected area
is rejuvenated.

185
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:30,150
It's an extremely beneficial
scientific phenomenon.

186
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,108
I've been wondering
this whole time,

187
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,567
"Who petrified humanity?

188
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,442
What force was
behind the attack?"

189
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,692
But... was it even
an attack at all?

190
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,608
Seeing as it was able
to fix Senku's neck,

191
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:53,650
maybe if we piece these
statues back together

192
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,525
and pour the revival
fluid on them,

193
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,275
they'll come back whole again.

194
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,567
[SENKU]
I tried that fairly early on.

195
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,525
They ended up turning into
dismembered corpses.

196
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,650
There has to be some reason
why it doesn't work.

197
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,900
[SENKU]
Yuzuriha.

198
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:17,275
Taiju is ten billion percent
too crude to pull it off,

199
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:20,442
but you're our super-skilled
crafts club member.

200
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:26,233
This is gonna be a grueling
mission. You up for it?

201
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,608
[inaudible]

202
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,275
Uh.

203
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:36,900
[whimpers]

204
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,233
That really, really sounds like
an extremely grueling mission,

205
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:41,483
but I'll do it!

206
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,400
[SENKU chuckles]

207
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,275
Well, that was an easy sell.

208
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,233
Crafting's about perseverance!

209
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:48,192
Hey! Are you telling secrets?

210
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:52,150
No fair! Don't keep it from me!

211
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,067
I, uh... I was saying
that maybe you and I

212
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,775
should go meet up with Tsukasa!

213
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,233
Well, there's an idea!

214
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:01,067
Go see Tsukasa, eh?

215
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,483
Say what?! Are you crazy?!

216
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,067
You mean the same homicidal
maniac that killed Senku?!

217
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,442
I mean, Senku's alive,

218
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,483
and Tsukasa used
to be a good dude!

219
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,525
But still, we all thought
he had killed Senku,

220
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:14,400
and I'm sure he
probably thinks he did!

221
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,650
And that is exactly
the advantage we gained

222
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,442
in that little fight.

223
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,025
[TAIJU]
Huh?

224
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:23,567
[SENKU] Listen, Tsukasa thinks
I'm rotting in hell right now.

225
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,733
I, on the other hand, know his
whereabouts in the real world.

226
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,650
We can have a major
advantage in this war

227
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:34,150
if the two of you can infiltrate
the "Tsukasa Empire"

228
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,025
and act as our spies.

229
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,483
[TAIJU gasps]

230
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,567
[SENKU] I gave her the
details of the mission

231
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,942
you'll be undertaking.

232
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,608
Taiju, your main objective
is to protect Yuzuriha.

233
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,483
With a blockhead like you,
the less you know, the better.

234
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:52,192
I got it, Senku.
Loud and clear.

235
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,692
[SENKU] Tsukasa's planning
on using the miracle fluid

236
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,275
to build an army of the
young and able-bodied.

237
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,942
He'll create a brutal world
ruled by the strongest,

238
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,358
with him at the top of it all.

239
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,567
In order to bring
down his empire

240
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,108
and stop the so-called
"purification,"

241
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,567
which is really
just mass murder,

242
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,358
we'll create our own rebel army,

243
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:14,025
using science as
our primary weapon.

244
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,025
But how are you gonna
pull that off, Senku?

245
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,150
You'll be alone.

246
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,067
She's right.

247
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,400
If we're both gone,

248
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,983
and Tsukasa's got control
of the miracle water,

249
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,483
you can't make gunpowder,

250
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,233
or more revival fluid
to wake up some allies.

251
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:27,983
[SENKU]
Huh?

252
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:32,150
Even for you, the answer
should be obvious.

253
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,233
I'm going to find whoever
sent up those smoke signals

254
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:39,025
and convince them
to join our side.

255
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:42,192
I just hope they don't end up
running into Tsukasa first,

256
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,733
because that could be a problem.

257
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,858
I'll have to assume they
haven't, and leave it at that.

258
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:51,650
[TAIJU] So, going forward,
the two of us will be spies

259
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,525
inside the Tsukasa Empire.

260
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:58,150
And you'll be recruiting for
the rebel science army.

261
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,817
We'll each be fighting
our own battles.

262
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,817
[SENKU]
Tch. That's the idea.

263
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,067
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

264
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,025
Better get going before
we start to cry.

265
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,900
[YUZURIHA]
You guys are pretty casual

266
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,942
about the whole thing.

267
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,358
But I guess boys tend
to be kinda stoic, huh?

268
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:21,567
It's true. And Senku is
a super logical dude.

269
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,233
We won't be seeing each
other for a little while.

270
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,942
Who knows if it'll be weeks,

271
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:29,692
or a couple of months,
or maybe even...

272
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:50,150
[TAIJU]
Senku! I promise!

273
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,858
[TAIJU] Wait, I shouldn't
be shouting like this.

274
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,650
[SENKU chuckles]

275
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,067
[SENKU] Just hang in there
until our paths cross again,

276
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,650
ya big oaf.

277
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:20,275
We already had to wait 3,700
years to see each other.

278
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:23,942
A few more months, or even
years, is no big deal.

279
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,233
Time is relative, ya know.

280
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,858
[SENKU]
But no matter how long it takes,

281
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,692
we will build our
kingdom of science.

282
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:53,358
Fifty-seven meters
behind me to the right.

283
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:54,650
Yeah.

284
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,108
I know that you've
been shadowing me

285
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,358
for the last two minutes.

286
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,567
So tell me who you are.

287
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,983
[TSUKASA]
Blue eyes. And she's young.

288
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,233
Did Taiju and Yuzuriha
revive her just now?

289
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,733
Or did she come from
somewhere else?

290
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,317
[giggles]

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,358
[yells]

292
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,025
Not too friendly, are you?

293
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,483
What's wrong with "Hello" or, I
don't know, "Nice to meet you?"

294
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,733
[GIRL]
Shut your mouth.

295
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:44,650
You can save that for
who you meet in hell.

296
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,442
[GIRL yells]

297
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:03,233
[TSUKASA] It's impossible to be
this young and this skilled.

298
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,983
If she'd been in the
martial arts community,

299
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,608
I would've heard of her.

300
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,608
Who is she?

301
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,733
I saw everything you did!

302
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,483
You took that girl hostage,

303
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,900
and when that gentleman
gave himself up to save her,

304
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:16,317
you just killed him on the spot!

305
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,275
I couldn't tell what
you were talking about,

306
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,275
but whatever your story is,
don't waste it on me!

307
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,525
Beg forgiveness from
the sorcerer gentleman

308
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,192
until your evil soul fades away!

309
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,692
[gasps]

310
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,442
What sorcerer?

311
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,858
Huh. He just covered
you with his magic,

312
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,400
and you don't remember?

313
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,692
The mysterious black powder

314
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:41,817
that summoned forth the
mighty mountain's rage!

315
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,233
[TSUKASA]
The mountain's rage?

316
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,275
Does she mean the explosion?

317
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,067
[TSUKASA]
Ah.

318
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,483
So you aren't one
of the revived.

319
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:56,150
But maybe a child of someone
who was? Is that it?

320
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,900
Or perhaps... What
generation are you?

321
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,358
[TSUKASA] I think she's
from a primitive tribe

322
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,775
with no concept of science.

323
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,858
I could easily rule over them,

324
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,400
or just kill them
if I choose to.

325
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:14,317
There's no reason to
attack at this point.

326
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,608
Huh.

327
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:19,567
So my immediate goal is
to return to that cave.

328
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,275
Taiju and Yuzuriha were taught
how to make gunpowder.

329
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:26,525
I need to claim that miracle
fluid before they do.

330
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,983
This is goodbye.

331
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,608
[gasps]

332
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:10,567
It's you. The sorcerer gentleman
who was protecting that girl.

333
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,067
You're alive!

334
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,650
[SENKU]
You need to stop talking.

335
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,525
We can introduce ourselves later
until we're blue in the face.

336
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,358
But now, it's a waste of energy!

337
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,067
Tch.

338
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,650
Do you think you can
make it until nightfall?

339
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,400
If you feel like you're dying,

340
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:29,025
we could risk blasting the tree
with the gunpowder I have left.

341
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,275
But if you hang in there,

342
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:32,858
I'm ten billion percent
sure I can save you.

343
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,983
It'll just take some time.

344
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,650
You're the only one who
can make that call,

345
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,483
so what's it gonna be?

346
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,650
You gotta tell me right now!

347
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:46,275
Yeah. My bones and
organs are fine.

348
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:47,900
I can hold on!

349
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,233
[SENKU] I'd guess the fallen
tree weighs roughly one ton.

350
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,067
To move it to the side
should take half that,

351
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,775
so 500 kilograms.

352
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,233
My weight of 60 kilograms,

353
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:10,942
multiplied by two
to the third power,

354
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,067
should get me to 500.

355
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,108
Three of these will
do the trick.

356
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,483
[SENKU]
Bamboo's barely strong enough.

357
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,858
I'll pack 'em with
dirt to fortify 'em.

358
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:27,817
[SENKU chuckles]

359
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,858
[SENKU] A little soap will
come in handy yet again.

360
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:32,233
This is an all-star team
of Professor Senku's

361
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,942
greatest inventions,
working together.

362
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,942
What in the world are you doing?

363
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,900
This is called science!

364
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,858
This particular device was
invented by Old Man Archimedes

365
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:49,150
a few hundred years B.C.

366
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,900
And it can make a skinny,
high-school nerd like me

367
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,775
as strong as Hercules!

368
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,608
The compound pulley!

369
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,775
[GIRL]
Amazing.

370
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:26,358
[SENKU]
Hm?

371
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:30,150
[GIRL] And I'm not talking about
the wisdom of Archi-whatever.

372
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,900
What I mean, is how you kept
going through every single step

373
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:36,233
until you solved the problem.

374
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,692
Your perseverance is amazing.

375
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,025
Guess it's time to
introduce myself.

376
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:45,983
My name is Kohaku.

377
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:50,233
And honestly, I believe I've
taken quite a liking to you.

378
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,567
