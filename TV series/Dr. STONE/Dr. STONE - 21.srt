Now that we have

So what is this thing?

A hydroelectric generator.

at me for this one.

You can thank Chrome

It's not done yet, though.

All of the precious electricity
this is harnessing

Um... okay. What do
you mean by that?

22
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,942
I mean, we need to build
containers for it.

23
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,067
Uh! Wait, we can store
that spinning power?

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,108
Yeah. Although they're gonna
be kind of a pain to build.

Heh. So get off your
asses, you two!

of hard-mode crafting to do

before we're able to
make our cell phones,

It's the beginning of our very

Yeah, I'm sorry. What about
this process has been simple?

[KASEKI] But, Senku,
ever since you showed up,

137
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,942
it's been a hell of a lot
harder, that's for sure.

138
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:03,983
But more importantly, it's been
a hell of a lot more fun.

Aside from a select
few of us here,

Whoa, cool.

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,317
But last time we made
a light source like this,

143
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,775
didn't it burn itself
out immediately?

up on the roof?

So what's the plan?

146
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,108
Well, when you want something
to burn, what do you do?

147
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:00,817
You feed it a ton of extra
air with a blowing machine,

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,025
like what we started doing
with the waterwheel?

00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:04,233
Then what do you
think you would do

150
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,692

the way mercury absorbs air.

Thanks to our hard work

Then do we actually

rid of all the air inside it.

Ah, poop!

316
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:48,317
[SENKU] A dead end.
After coming this far.

317
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,775
[SUIKA] I may not be a rock
doctor like Senku is,

318
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,067
but I've seen a lot of rocks

319
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,108
while playing in the
mountains and forests.

320
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,983
So maybe I can find a rare
rock that could help us out,

321
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,358
and be useful to everyone.

322
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,525
[SENKU]
If we can't make cell phones,

323
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,567
we can't make cell phones.

324
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,608
I don't have time to sulk.

325
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:36,192
Come on, just think
of something else.

326
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:40,192
Oh, Senku! Wakey-wakey!

327
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,150
It's officially the new year.

328
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,858
And everyone's planning to go
watch the sunrise together.

329
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,817
[GEN] It's important
to have a mental reset

330
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
every now and then.

331
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,942
Trust me, I would know.

332
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,692
[SENKU] Yeah, yeah, you're
a mentalist. I get it.

333
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,942
Uh. I wanna come, too.
Wait up, you guys!

334
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:03,525
[CHROME] Suika, were you going
through rocks all night?

335
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,358
[RURI] It's because you want
to be useful, too, huh?

336
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,817
[SUIKA]
That's right.

337
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,108
Already New Years. My
internal clock is messed up.

338
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,067
Must be due to
the petrification.

339
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,608
I couldn't even tell you
how old I am anymore.

340
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,275
Don't you know how many
days you've been alive?

341
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,858
[GEN]
Uh?

342
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,650
Who in their right mind could
possibly remember such a thing?

343
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,525
You don't, right, Senku?

344
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,900
Six thousand, two hundred
and sixty-eight.

345
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,067
[GEN chuckles]

346
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,733
[KOHAKU chuckles]

347
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,442
We're almost there.

348
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:47,733
The sun is just about to rise.

349
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,567
[gasps]

350
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,900
[SENKU]
A blue... gemstone?

351
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,858
[RURI]
So pretty.

352
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,442
Uh. Huh? But-- What the--?

353
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,358
Why is it glowing?

354
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:22,067
I can tell you why.
It's scheelite.

355
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,900
It glows blue when exposed
to ultraviolet light.

356
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,400
Reactions to ultraviolet
light are especially visible

357
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,233
right before the sun rises.

358
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,442
So only right now.

359
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,192
It would only glow
in this moment?

360
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,858
Quite the poetic magic rock.

361
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:42,567
I've never seen
this. Like, ever!

362
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,983
Yeah, you're not the only one.

363
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,733
That's an ultra-rare
mineral right there.

364
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:51,608
An insanely good find from the
Chrome and Suika tag team.

365
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:55,817
This is the exact stuff used
in 21st century filaments!

366
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,567
Atomic number 74: Tungsten!

367
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,192
[SENKU] The strongest
metal known to man,

368
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,650
that can't be defeated by heat!

369
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,067
This small chunk
won't be enough,

370
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,317
but it came from
upstream in the cave.

371
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,858
So there's gotta be
more farther inside.

372
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:27,525
A bona fide treasure trove of
this heat-resistant tungsten!

373
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:29,817
We only have one set
of lights left,

374
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,192
so the last member of the
exploration team'll be...

375
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,067
[KOHAKU]
It shouldn't be me.

376
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,150
I have to keep training
our fighters.

377
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,650
But who, then?

378
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,233
[KINRO]
If I'm called upon, I will go.

379
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,442
[GINRO]
Yeah, no way!

380
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:49,650
Just pick one of the others.
I'm too scared!

381
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:50,900
[SUIKA]
If they need me,

382
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:53,525
I'll make myself as useful
as I possibly can!

383
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,442
[KASEKI] I wouldn't mind, but
we're exploring caves, right?

384
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,567
My back may give out.

385
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,108
[GEN] I get the feeling
you won't be needing

386
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,608
a mentalist in the caves.

387
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:04,025
[chuckles]

388
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:05,400
[SENKU]
Magma.

389
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,942
Tungsten's tough as hell,

390
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,317
so we're going to need your
brute force to collect it.

391
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,817
[SENKU chuckles]

392
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,983
We're a trio of
spelunking buddies--

393
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,400
you ready to go cave diving?

394
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,983
To the real live
treasure dungeon!

395
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,317
[MAGMA]
Buddies?
