1
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:17,400
Let's say I did let
you live, right?

2
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:21,025
You would develop civilization
just like before.

3
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,692
Can you promise that
you won't do that?

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,942
[SENKU chuckles]

5
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,733
[SENKU]
The hell are you talking about?

6
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,400
I could promise anything
to stay alive.

7
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,400
No. You would never lie.

8
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,525
Not when it comes to science.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,567
So will you promise me, here
and now, and for all eternity,

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,900
that you'll abandon science?

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,233
Because if you can make
that pledge, you can live.

12
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,942
And then I won't be forced
into killing you.

13
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:59,650
No, I can't. I can't do that.

14
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,983
Of course not. I knew
that would be your answer.

15
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:12,317
Just kill me in one blow.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,567
Because leaving me
to suffer till I die

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,275
is both illogical
and inefficient.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Don't worry, Senku.

19
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:23,608
I'm going to sever
your cervical nerve.

20
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,817
It'll be instantaneous.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,150
You'll be knocked unconscious
and die without suffering.

22
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,525
I won't miss.

Senku, I have a feeling

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,942
that if we had met each

Please! Answer me, Senku!

Open your eyes! Wake up
and say something!

C'mon. This can't be right.
There's no way!

Don't let it end
like this, Senku.

After everything you've
done, you can't just die!

Talk to me!

00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,358
I gave him a painless
death. It's over.

50
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,233
I trust that as his friends,

51
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:44,942
you will give him
a proper burial.

[gasps]

00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,400
[TSUKASA]
Even if Taiju wasn't a pacifist,

54
00:04:56,483 --> 00:05:00,108
he'd never risk endangering
Yuzuriha by attacking me.

55
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,942
That was the power
dynamic between us.

56
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:07,983
But, Taiju, if Senku's death
sends you into a rage

57
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:12,275
and drives you to
attack me mindlessly...

58

...then I'll have
to kill you, too.

[TAIJU] It's fine,
Yuzuriha. Don't worry.

I'm still thinking clearly.

[TSUKASA]
Of course.

64
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,567
I have no choice but to fight.

Sorry, Yuzuriha.
But I can only hope--

[YUZURIHA]
No. It's okay, Taiju.

67

After all, the three of us
made each other a promise.

68
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,400
It'll all work out.
There's no doubt in my mind.

Yeah. Thanks a lot, Yuzuriha.

Overhead? Why?

73
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,775
[TSUKASA]
It must be a decoy.

74
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:39,733
Good try, but I won't
fall for it, Taiju.

75
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,525
No matter what you
do, you've lost.

76
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,983
[TAIJU] Tsukasa's worried
I'll attack him.

77
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:48,358
He won't dare take
his eyes off me!

78
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:52,358
And that... is why
she has a chance!

79
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,233
[YUZURIHA] Tsukasa thinks
I'm Taiju's weakness.

80
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,942
Someone he has to protect.

81
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:03,108
And in a primitive, stone world
like this one, it makes sense.

82
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,067
[YUZURIHA]
But it's like Senku told us...

[YUZURIHA, TAIJU] Science levels
the playing field for everyone!

[TSUKASA]
That's black powder!

85
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,608
[YUZURIHA] Senku didn't
leave us with nothing!

86
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:37,192
[TAIJU] We have science
to remember him by!

87
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:41,442
The three of us made a promise
to work together and stop you!

88
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,525
[TAIJU] Me, Yuzuriha,
and Senku as well...

00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,067
...we're fighting
this battle together!

90
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:00,025
Goodbye, Tsukasa!

91
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,442
[TSUKASA] Taiju would
never attack anyone.

92
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,317
Knowing that, I think he
must've expected me

93
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,525
to come out of this unscathed.

94
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:55,317
[TAIJU]
Goodby, Tsukasa!

95
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,192
[TSUKASA]
So that's what he meant.

96
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:08,233
It's gonna be okay, Senku.
You said it yourself, remember?

97
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:11,567
If we're gonna run for it,
then we have to do it together!

98
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,567
I don't care what anyone says--
you're not dying on me!

99
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,650
I know you're alive!

100
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,108
We've only just started
bringing back civilization,

101
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,233
and you're not the kind of guy
to leave a job half done!

102
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,483
[TSUKASA]
What's the point of fleeing?

103
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,942
[TSUKASA] I know for a fact that
I severed his cervical nerve.

104
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:45,317
[TSUKASA] There's no
coming back from that.

105
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,942
Especially not in a Stone
World that has no medicine.

106
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,983
[TAIJU] I'm trying to give
him a heart massage,

107
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,067
but I have no idea
if I'm doing it right.

108
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,275
But I can't do nothing,
and this is all I can think of.

109
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,692
[TAIJU]
Wait! What about mouth to mouth?

110

Ah! Hold on a second!

111
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,900
I think we need to
keep his neck still!

112
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,983
Because that's where
Tsukasa hit him.

113
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:12,567
I'd been caught, and Senku
gave himself up for me.

114
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,442
Wait, you're saying he
sacrificed himself?

I think I'd get stuck picking
between my friend and my lover.

...that'd let me save all of us.

129
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,358
[YUZURIHA]
Guess that's the kind of answer

130
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,983
you'd expect from the
Science Club's president.

131
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,608
[TAIJU]
That's actually an option?

132
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,442
Well, it's my choice, too, then!

133
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,442
[STUDENT A] I think the point of
the question is more to reveal

134
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,608
who's most important to you.

135
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,817
[SENKU] That's ten billion
percent obvious.

136
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,150
Your book belongs in the trash.

137
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,483
[TAIJU] Senku wouldn't
go the suicide route.

138
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,442
He wouldn't sacrifice anyone.

139
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,900
He would stake the whole game
on the chance to save us all.

140
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:19,983
We have to figure out
what he was thinking.

141
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,317
If anyone can do it,
then it should be his friends!

142
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,525
He must've left us a hint!

143
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,275
His neck.

144
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,108
Back at the hot spring,
when I was caught,

145
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,817
Senku was drawing
attention to his neck.

146
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,150
I think that's where he wanted
Tsukasa to strike him.

[TAIJU]
You're right.

148
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,442
That thing he was doing,
it's not a habit he always had.

149
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,775
Why'd he keep touching
his neck and cracking it?

150
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:52,150
Was he trying to
tell us something?

When we removed the stone
that was left on your foot,

That when we "de-petrified,"

157
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:12,567
cracks were filled in
as part of the process.

158
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,233
Here, Taiju! The revival fluid!

[TAIJU]
Right.

160
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,400
[YUZURIHA] It might work
on Senku's neck, too!

161
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,400
There's a chance.

162
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:28,150
Yeah, when he's de-petrified,
his neck might be fixed as well.

163
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,358
The petrification's gone!

[screams]

165
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:47,858
Wake up, Senku!

166
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,275
I knew you'd live!

167
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,442
I knew you weren't gonna
let yourself be killed,

168
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:54,067
not in a place like this!

Senku, you're...
the star of hope.

170
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,233
For humanity.

171
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:04,400
For all of civilization!

172
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,358
So please... come back!

173
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:11,483
You have to wake up, Senku!

[SENKU]
One, two, three, four,

five, six, seven, eight, nine.

176
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,733
Heh.

177
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:43,983
All right.

178
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,275
I can make it past
800,000 seconds

179
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,233
without all-but losing
consciousness now.

180
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,817
Guess my brain's
finally adjusting.

181
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,567
[SENKU]
I've been frozen for

182
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:01,358
117,354,889,550 seconds.

183
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,858
[SENKU] So this is the
3,718th spring since I froze.

184
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,942
Starting in spring
is an absolute must

185
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,817
if I wanna survive.

186
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:20,692
[SENKU]
Okay. No time like the present.

187
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,983
Come on, me, get up.

188
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,025
Get up.

00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:27,775
Get up, damn it!

Get up! Get up!

00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:51,983
Yeah! I'm finally free!

194
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:55,942
[SENKU] Yeah. A flashy entrance
like that would've been fun.

[chuckles]

196
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,150
[SENKU]
And I'm ten billion percent sure

197
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,442
that's how my blockhead friend
Taiju would've done it.

198
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:06,525
My first objective is to
evaluate my surroundings.

199
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,275
I'll start with my own body.

200
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:11,233
It can give me clues that're
worth its weight in gold.

201
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:17,567
[SENKU] My initial location.
The position of my body.

202
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,275
Even the order in which these
mysterious stone fragments

203
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,525
fell off me.

204
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:23,983
I'm gonna keep every last piece

205
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,567
for when I'm ready
to investigate later.

Am I the first human
they've seen?

00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:08,942
[SENKU] Doesn't look like
civilization survived.

218
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,775
This is a whole new world.

219
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,150
And from the looks of things,

220
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,733
I might be the first shiny
monkey to be born in it.

[SENKU] This is

00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,650
Huh. This is some
nasty mental math.

Especially when I factor
in the leap years.

Not to mention the
earth's rotation slows

00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:47,400
by 17 millionths of
a second every year.

Behold the power of the

My forebears had the
technology to reach space,

00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:22,150
and I'll rebuild their
civilization from scratch.

What a moron.

[SENKU] I'm neither
a meathead like Taiju,

00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:55,317
nor an ultra-dextrous craft
club kid like Yuzuriha.

244
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,733
There's no way
I can start a fire

00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,775
with nothing but a
primitive hand drill.

[SENKU]
That's right.

This shiny monkey has
neither fangs nor claws.

250
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:17,358
All I can do is improvise,
one step at a time.

251
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,983
That's how
civilization advances.

00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,983

definitely a dumb-dumb.

255
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,650
[SENKU]
There's a trick to this,

256
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:46,650
but I'll only find it
through trial and error.

257
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,400
Maybe I should bash
the edges off in mid-air.

258
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,525
[SENKU] Or I could use
a solid foundation,

259
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:56,442
and aim right at the edge,
chipping at both pieces at once.

260
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:59,358
Can't forget that different
stones have different uses.

261
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:03,150
This colorful piece of chert
is the hardest rock around.

262
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:07,108
Which makes it the perfect
material to craft into a knife.

he's twisting it now.

is just as smooth as his skin.

[SENKU]
Surprisingly enough,

269
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,817
there are quite a few
animals that use tools.

Crows, otters,
orangutans, and more.

But out of all the
creatures in this world,

272
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,275
only one can make
use of science.
