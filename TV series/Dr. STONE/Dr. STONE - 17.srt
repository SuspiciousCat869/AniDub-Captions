[SENKU] If I'm aware enough
to realize that much,

Not bad.

Now start thinking.
For instance...

13
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,233
[BYAKUYA, SENKU]
...there should be a delay

14
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:02,525
between the average time
stamps of the last posts

15

Twitter or Instagram.

[BYAKUYA] Find those and
calculate backwards,

17
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:11,442
and we can learn where the
mysterious light originated.

18
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,150
It looks like it started
in South America,

19
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:17,692
since the petrification wave
spread out radially from there.

20
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:19,275
What a way to figure it out.

21
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:20,858
I never would've
thought of that.

I'd love to brag, but I can't
take any credit for the idea.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,775
My son Senku told me about
using this method many times.

24
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:30,900
Now that we know that,
it's time to go.

Hang in there, Senku.
I'm gonna save you.

You and all seven billion
other humans down there.

Are you really going back?
We're in the dark!

28
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,858
For all we know, you might
be petrified when you land.

29
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,900
If you have to, then go
somewhere far from the source.

30
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,650
Japan's the opposite side
of Earth from South America.

31
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,692
If that light acts
like radiation,

32
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,442
you need to stay away from it.

Yeah, well, somebody

35
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:36,400
It's my idea, so I should
really go alone, but--

36
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,275
Then there wouldn't be enough
room for us all to return.

37
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,525
There's two pods,
three seats each,

38
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:44,650
which means three of us
need to take the plunge.

You'll have no ground
crew to help.

It's an unprecedented feat.

00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,692
You could even be petrified
while maneuvering.

And you've got a son,
don't you, old man?

and we aren't petrified.

The bad news is, we severely
missed our target

and landed in the
water upside-down.

We have to go down there.
We can find a boat and get them.

And where do we find the
key to start this boat?

He wouldn't let some
rocks do him in.

160
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,150
Maybe we won't live to see
it ourselves, but him?

161
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,900
He'll figure it out.

162
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:46,983
He'll save everyone. All seven
billion people on Earth.

163

[BYAKUYA]
Someday, when Senku is revived,

164
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,275
he's gonna need some
friends to help him.

165
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:01,067
So we'll pass along the baton,

166
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,983
thousands of years
into the future.

167
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,900
[SUIKA] I wish I could say
that I followed that,

168
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:28,025
but it's such a crazy story
that I'm completely lost.

169
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:28,942
Right.

170
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:31,025
So a few thousand years ago,

171
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,983
all of humanity was
turned into stone.

172
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,817
You know those stone statues
we see everywhere?

173
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,067
Those are all people.

174
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,525
But Senku's dad and
five others survived

175
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,817
because they were up in
the sky when it happened.

176
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,233
And all of us here
in Ishigami Village

177
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,858
are actually descendants
of those six people.

178
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,275
Hold on. That raises
the question:

179
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,733
Are we all related to Senku?

180

[chuckles]

Byakuya and I are legally father
and son, but not by blood.

Besides, we're hundreds
of generations apart.

after that much time.

We're still celebrating
our new village chief!

You two just want
an excuse to drink.

but I gladly accept 'em.

313
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,983
[VILLAGERS chattering]

314
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,692
Thanks for the offer, but
I'm strictly a cola man.

315
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,150
Never heard of it.

316
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,317
I wouldn't be able to talk
business if I got drunk.

317
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,692
And now that the
village is gathered,

318
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,025
I've got a message to deliver.

319
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,483
[SENKU]
Yeah?

320
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,108
Well, let's hear it then,
mentalist. What've you got?

321
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:05,608
I can take a guess.
The Tsukasa Empire?

322
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:10,192
He's coming. And he's
bringing an army.

323
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,442
[ALL gasp]

324
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,233
[SENKU chuckles]

325
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,900
[SENKU] Sounds like we'll
finally get the chance

326
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:19,817
to show them what the Kingdom
of Science is made of.

327
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,858
Are you guys ready? Get excited.
