1
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:10,900
[KOHAKU]
Amazing.

2
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,942
[SENKU]
Hm?

3
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,442
Guess it's time to
introduce myself.

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:17,400
My name is Kohaku.

5
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:21,733
And honestly, I believe I've
taken quite a liking to you.

6
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:22,983
[giggles]

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,150
[SENKU]
Ugh.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,025
I can't say that I can give
one millimeter of support

9
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,733
for what I just heard.

10
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,108
We've just met, and you're
already professing your love?

11
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,608
Not how to handle an emergency.

12
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,858
I didn't say anything
about falling in love!

13
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:38,442
I'm saying I like
you as a person

14
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,650
and I think the two of
us can work together!

15
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:44,275
[SENKU] Oh. Well, thanks.
I appreciate that.

16
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,483
'Cause nothing's as illogical
or prone to trouble

17
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,692
as a romantic entanglement.

18
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:52,983
[SENKU]
Hm?

19
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,233
What are you, a new
species of hominid

20
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,942
that sleeps with a
weapon or something?

21
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,358
Makes it obvious I don't
have love on the brain.

22
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:05,983
Look, I may be curious
about your ways,

23
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,483
but I'm not sure how
much I can trust you yet.

24
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,692
Besides, it's a force of habit,
because I watch out for myself,

25
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,483
so don't take it personally.

26
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,817
[SENKU] I'm not enough of a hero
to attack a lioness like you,

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,067
so quit wasting time
and get some rest.

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,150
[KOHAKU]
"Lioness"?

29
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,192
I am a person! With feelings!

30
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,858
You might've seemed like
a gentleman at first,

31
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,733
but you're actually kinda
rude, ya know that?

32
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,983
I'm afraid I might accidentally
end up killing you.

33
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,775
If you just go to sleep,
there won't be any accidents.

34
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:34,567
I'm not too keen on the idea
of dying twice in one day.

35
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,192
[KOHAKU]
You're fighting against

36
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,817
that long-haired
man, aren't you?

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,817
I'll help you with that.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,442
I'm not the type
to just run away

39
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,192
with my tail between my legs.

40
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,733
[SENKU]
Yeah.

41
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,025
That's why I'm setting out to
build a kingdom of science.

42
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,775
But what I need...
is manpower first.

43
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:58,067
Oh, yeah? So you're lookin'
for allies, are ya?

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,817
Well, then why don't
you come along with me?

45
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:04,900
So you've got some
more lion buddies?

46
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:06,858
There a whole pride
of you somewhere?

47
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,233
[KOHAKU]
That's right.

48
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:10,108
I'm sure they would be
great allies for the battle.

49
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,275
Especially one guy
in particular.

50
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,817
I'll lead you to 'em, Senku.

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
You just gotta follow me.

52
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,858
[SENKU]
Hot spring water?

53
00:03:55,942 --> 00:04:00,400
[KOHAKU] Yeah. I'm taking
it back home for a bath.

54
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:02,358
It's good for the
healing process.

55
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,192
Why do you need to
take a healing bath

56
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:07,108
when you're obviously, like,
ten billion percent healthy?

57
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,150
The thought of an overpowered
lion girl like you

58
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,025
running around is
kinda terrifying.

59
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,358
I am not a lion!

60
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,900
And for your information,
it's for my sister!

61
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:18,275
Honestly, carrying this big,
heavy thing of water

62
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,442
is a lot of trouble
to go through.

63
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,400
But she's been especially
sick for way too long now.

64
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:26,358
Sometimes I feel kinda guilty
for being so healthy.

65
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:29,275
If only we could switch
bodies once in a while.

66
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,483
Looks to me like that
jar probably holds

67
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,525
a bit less than 50 liters.

68
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,317
Doesn't seem like enough
to fill a bathtub.

69
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,942
I wonder how often
you have to lug

70
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,608
that heavy-ass thing
back and forth.

71
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,317
A few times a day, right?

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,150
[KOHAKU] Heh. I've made it
a part of my daily training.

73
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,650
Thanks to these trips,
I'm a lot stronger.

74
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,525
I know I was
complaining earlier,

75
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,942
but honestly, I'm
pretty grateful tha-

76
00:04:58,817 --> 00:04:59,983
[SENKU]
In case you've forgotten,

77
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,442
you had a tree fall
on you yesterday.

78
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,817
I don't want you to over-exert
yourself and die on me,

79
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,567
so hand it over.

80
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,608
Thanks, Senku.

81
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,067
[thudding]

82
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,108
I'd over-exert myself, huh?

83
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,442
[SENKU] Am I the only
one in this Stone World

84
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,692
who's not practically a gorilla?

85
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,233
I mean, Taiju,
Tsukasa, and now you?

86
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,400
[KOHAKU]
"Gorilla"?

87
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,567
Okay, I actually prefer
"lioness" to that!

88
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,525
[SENKU]
That's not... the point here.

89
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,025
Whoa! How in the
heck did you build

90
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,775
such a useful thing so quickly?

91
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,567
It wasn't really that quick.

92
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,108
I just had some materials ready

93
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,358
from making that
pulley yesterday.

94
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,317
Progress gives rise to progress,

95
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,067
and applying that to further
civilization is science.

96
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,192
[KOHAKU]
Turn right up here!

97
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,775
We missed the turn!

98
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,733
Look, Senku. Check it out!

99
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:57,692
[groaning]

100
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,858
[gasps]

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,025
We're here, so welcome
to my village.

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,942
[SENKU]
How many people live here?

103
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,692
[KOHAKU] Well, not counting
the kids and retirees,

104
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,900
there are 40 of us,
all working together.

105
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,983
More than 40 of you?

106
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,775
[SENKU] Kohaku and the others
don't appear to have

107
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:26,442
any knowledge of
modern technology.

108
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,650
So I'll bet that means
they're descendants of people

109
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,400
who revived a long time ago.

110
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:34,858
Which means there was a first
generation at some point.

111
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,233
Maybe even hundreds
of years ago.

112
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,233
I wonder if there was a
man of science, like me,

113
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,025
who was able to come up
with an earlier version

114
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,483
of the revival fluid.

115
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:46,025
But there's really
no sign of that,

116
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:48,275
or evidence of any kind
of scientific advancement

117
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,025
passed down through
the generations.

118
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,442
Where did all these
people come from?

119
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,275
[gasps]

120
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,483
There's no need for all
of that, Kinro and Ginro.

121
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,775
This man saved
my life yesterday.

122
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,150
Great news.

123
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,900
But you should know better.
Can't break the rules.

124
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,650
Under no circumstances
are we allowed

125
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,650
to let outsiders
enter the village.

126
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,900
The chief will be
angry with you.

127
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,483
There's no use in
arguing about it.

128
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,067
The rules are the rules.

129
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,983
People from outside the
village aren't welcome.

130
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,858
Because they're all criminals,
or were banished by the chief.

131
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,108
Therefore, we cannot let
him cross this bridge.

132
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:37,608
Even if he saved your life,
we can't make any exceptions.

133
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:41,192
[KOHAKU] Oh, yeah? Then you
leave us no other choice.

134
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:44,150
We'll just have to battle
it out right here and now.

135
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,858
But it's really not fair.

136
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,275
There's two of you
and one of me.

137
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,525
Should put me at a
major disadvantage.

138
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,900
[GINRO chuckles nervously]

139
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,567
[SENKU chuckles]

140
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,233
[SENKU] I really did walk
in to the lions' den.

141
00:07:57,317 --> 00:08:01,442
Heh. You're all growling
and snarling at each other.

142
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,067
Sorcery!

143
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,442
[BOTH gasp]

144
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:07,692
[gasps]

145
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,692
[GINRO]
What's happening?

146
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,233
How come there's
all these mysterious

147
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,400
floating jewels in the sky?

148
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:20,192
Wow. So that's their level, eh?

149
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,567
[chuckles]

150
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,150
Well, I guess this is gonna
be no problem at all.

151
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:27,108
I'm gonna get every last one of
them on my side with science.

152
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:30,192
Nothing like having brains
and a small army on your side.

153
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,483
It's time to get excited.

154
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,400
You sound pretty
creepy right now.

155
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,067
Maybe don't get
ahead of yourself?

156
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,192
This doesn't seem to
be helping at all!

157
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,483
When I stab 'em, they multiply!

158
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,317
Okay, then. There's
no other choice!

159
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,150
Special Technique:
"Let someone else handle it"!

160
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,317
Hey, Chrome, help! It's sorcery!

161
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,483
[CHROME] Yeah, yeah. Would ya
quit freakin' out, Ginro?

162
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,817
I'm one step ahead
of you, as usual.

163
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,442
I spotted them from the beach.

164
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,442
So of course I ran here
as fast as I could.

165
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,108
Hey! I'm the one called Chrome!
Bad and insanely smart.

166
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,108
I'm the genius sorcerer
of the village!

167
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,817
[KOHAKU] Ha. Looks like we won't
have to track him down, Senku.

168
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,025
This is the guy I
mentioned yesterday.

169
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:26,275
Ah. So he's a
"sorcerer," now is he?

170
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:30,150
My name's Senku.
And I'm a scientist.

171
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,150
I know you're scared 'cause
you're not as smart as me,

172
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,067
but don't let his cheap
trickery get to you!

173
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,567
These things are super
easy to create!

174
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,858
All you need is charcoal,
ash, and boiling water.

175
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,608
I wasn't scared of them.

176
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:45,942
But you'd be a fool not to
be cautious of the unknown.

177
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,525
I actually was pretty
scared, to be honest.

178
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,733
We don't need you here, Chrome.

179
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:51,900
I'm not dumb enough to believe

180
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:53,942
that your dubious
sorcery would help us.

181
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,608
Believe what you want.
I don't care.

182
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,358
But know this!
I'm not backing down!

183
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,692
'Cause sorcery is my specialty!

184
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:05,650
So step off and let
me handle this guy!

185
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,275
If we fight right here,

186
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,983
there's a chance some of
the villagers could get hurt.

187
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,150
Let's move it somewhere else.

188
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,983
[laughs]

189
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,358
[GINRO whimpers]

190
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,817
[GINRO] What does a sorcery
battle even look like?

191
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,317
{\an8}Ah! They aren't gonna start
shooting fireballs

192
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,233
{\an8}and burn us alive are they?

193
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,858
Please stop! At least don't
do anything dangerous!

194
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,150
I don't wanna die!

195
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,275
[laughing]

196
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,567
All right. Ready for
some badass sorcery?

197
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,192
Check out my Rainbow Bridge!

198
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:45,942
I am the master of
the flames and fire!

199
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,817
[GINRO]
Whoa! He did it!

200
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,025
He made the fire turn yellow!

201
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,067
[GINRO] It changed again.
It's greenish blue!

202
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,400
And now it's purple?

203
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,317
Wow. It's crazy!

204
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
Sorcery.

205
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,525
"Rainbow Bridge"?
What total crap.

206
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,400
They're reactions to
basic flame tests.

207
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,900
You threw salt, copper,
and some sulfur

208
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,025
into the fire, in that order.

209
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,400
So, the copper...
is it copper sulfate?

210
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,817
He wouldn't know that.

211
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,692
Did you use some blue crystals?

212
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,817
Maybe you found
them in the caves?

213
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,192
[CHROME]
Oh, shit!

214
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,150
How in the hell would a
total outsider like him

215
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,858
know about the blue crystals?

216
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,733
He must be able to read
my mind or something!

217
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,317
No way! Is that his
kind of sorcery?

218
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,358
I didn't even know
that was possible!

219
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,067
"Oh, no, I'm so scared,
I gotta run away now!"

220
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,775
That's what I thought
would happen.

221
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,067
"You've defeated me.

222
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,817
Please allow me to
be your apprentice,"

223
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,192
was another possibility.

224
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,858
I mean, one or the other,
but not like this!

225
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,942
I was actually kinda worried
what my plan would be

226
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,650
if he had asked to
become my apprentice.

227
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:54,983
Uh. Hey.

228
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,525
I'll have you know
that my sorcery

229
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,442
is definitely not just
completely made up

230
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,692
of little tricks and
cheap crap like that.

231
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,317
[KOHAKU]
I didn't say anything.

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,025
[CHROME]
Oh, you wait and see.

233
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,108
I'm gonna get one of my
instruments of sorcery

234
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,067
that will put the hurt
on you for sure!

235
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,608
It's a legit weapon!

236
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,108
Wonder what he's got in there.

237
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,942
Must be why we moved the battle.

238
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,900
To be near his
"instruments of sorcery."

239
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,525
[grunting]

240
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,192
[CHROME panting]

241
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,983
Ow! That hurts! What the
hell did you do to me?

242
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,025
[CHROME chuckles]

243
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,567
A sulfur ball.

244
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,525
You took some of the same stuff
you threw on the fire earlier

245
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,067
and put it in an urn.

246
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,108
You melted it down,
let it cool and harden,

247
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,942
and then broke the
urn around it.

248
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,233
Neat way to make one of these.

249
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,608
A sulfur ball static generator.

250
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:53,108
Originally invented back
in the 17th century.

251
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,817
I'm starting to get
pretty excited about you.

252
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,192
Heh.

253
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,150
But rubbing it with leather
instead of your hands

254
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,233
will make ten billion
times more power.

255
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:03,275
I'll use my science flag.

256
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,400
Holy crap! That's so bad!

257
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,233
The guy's hair is all spiky!

258
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,358
It was already pretty spiky.

259
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,608
[KOHAKU]
Oh, wow. How does that work?

260
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:15,692
[chuckles]

261
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:16,275
[gasps]

262
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:17,108
[GINRO]
Ohh...

263
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,525
[CHROME]
Hey, give it back!

264
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,733
Feels like I'm watchin'
"baby's first science class"

265
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,108
with this dude.

266
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,150
It's all so primitive.

267
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:36,692
[SENKU] Chrome, did you think
up all this stuff by yourself

268
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,775
in this backwards
little village?

269
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,650
All these minerals and
scientific materials,

270
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:42,942
you took it upon yourself

271
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,150
to gather and collect
them in that shed?

272
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:48,192
You bet I did!
Why do you care?

273
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:50,650
It's normal for kids to
find stuff and keep it.

274
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,567
Smash it all together,
mix it up, burn it.

275
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,358
And when something
really crazy happens,

276
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,275
that's what you call sorcery.

277
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,817
Think about it,
what else could it be?

278
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,025
[SENKU]
Tch.

279
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,608
[SENKU chuckles]

280
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,567
[SENKU]
Check it out, Tsukasa.

281
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,775
You can kill me,

282
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,775
or anyone else with
a brain for that matter.

283
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:13,650
You can try all you want
to kill science itself,

284
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,567
but there will always be some
idiot who'll try anything

285
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,733
just to see what happens.

286
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,983
Eventually the shiny
monkeys will create

287
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,400
a technological civilization.

288
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,942
Listen, the way things
are going right now,

289
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,358
I'm ten billion percent sure

290
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,025
that you're exactly
the type of person

291
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:33,608
that Tsukasa is gonna kill.

292
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,108
And the only way
for you to survive

293
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,817
is if you join our
kingdom of science.

294
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,733
[CHROME] Who's Tsukasa?
What are you talking about?

295
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,108
[SENKU cackling]

296
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,483
[SENKU] I would love if you
joined forces with us,

297
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,483
and lent your shed of
science to the cause!

298
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,900
Hey! You're not taking
my stuff, okay?!

299
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,692
[CHROME]
Damn it, I look like an idiot.

300
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:52,400
I can't back down now.

301
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:55,858
I challenge you to one last
battle! Just you and me!

302
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,692
If you lose, you'll leave the
village after you bow to me!

303
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:01,817
If you win, take everything in
the shed and I'll work for you!

304
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,150
You sure?

305
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,608
[CHROME] I'll show you
things you've never seen,

306
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,400
because I'm the
greatest of all time!

307
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:10,733
Arithmetic! Fight me in
a battle of numbers!

308
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,317
I have a strong
feeling that Senku

309
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,483
is about to wipe
the floor with you.

310
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,567
[CHROME yelps]

311
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,483
I'm super excited about this!

312
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,983
[chuckles] Oh, man.

313
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,525
How many years did it take you

314
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,025
to collect all this amazing
stuff you're keeping in here?

315
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,025
Totally awesome,
don't you think?

316
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,233
You kicked my butt--

317
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:38,608
uh, well, only because
I was off my game--

318
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,483
but my collection
could never be beat!

319
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,233
[KOHAKU] It's all just
a bunch of stupid rocks.

320
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,108
Malachite! Chalcanthite!
And corundum!

321
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,400
So bad and insanely tough!

322
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,442
I can't tell any
difference between them.

323
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,108
How can the two of
you get so excited

324
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,400
over a couple of rocks, anyway?

325
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:59,900
I can't believe you've got
galena! Lead has been acquired!

326
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,525
That one's super shiny
when you break it open!

327
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,858
Sorry, but I'll never understand

328
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:06,317
why they think these
things are so cool

329
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,150
just because they collect them.

330
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,150
I used to collect bugs
when I was a little kid.

331
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,442
But now they totally
creep me out.

332
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,608
[SENKU]
You even have cinnabar in here?!

333
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,650
I hope you have fun showing off
the most boring trophies ever.

334
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:22,567
I gotta bring this hot spring
water up to my sister.

335
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,733
[SENKU]
Cinnabar.

336
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,525
Sometimes called the
philosopher's stone,

337
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,525
and a handy item
in <i>Dragon Quest</i> .

338
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,817
If you heat it up,
you'll get mercury.

339
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,442
There they go with all
their creepy sorcery.

340
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,983
Do as you like
outside the village.

341
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,400
But take one step on this bridge
and I'll cut you down.

342
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,525
The rules are the rules.

343
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:46,192
Now, just melt some gold
dust into the mercury.

344
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,317
[grunts]

345
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:54,608
You'd better not inhale
the smoke. You'll die.

346
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,233
But this shiny golden spear
is pretty awesome, isn't it?

347
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,108
Whoa!

348
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,900
That is bad!

349
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,317
And what good will
this sorcery do me?

350
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,275
Heh. There's really no
practical advantage to it.

351
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,233
But your name does mean "gold,"

352
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:14,192
so a golden spear
is perfect for you.

353
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,025
Your bribe won't work.

354
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,025
Give me all of the shiny
objects you want,

355
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,567
but I still won't break
the rules for you.

356
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,483
Nuts.

357
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,275
Kinro's a stick in the mud.

358
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,983
Practically all the
guy ever says is

359
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,817
"The rules are the rules."

360
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,858
[KINRO] 'Cause it's true.
Rules are rules.

[KINRO]
That being said,

362
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:39,192
I think I'll just keep
it like it is now.

All he needs is one more push.

Hey, so, what about
a silver spear?

366
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:46,650
[SENKU]
You're like one of those people

367
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,942
who plays <i>Monster Hunter</i> ,

368
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,108
but only so they can
collect raw materials.

[SENKU]
You have a lot of plants, too.

371
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,483
Felwort, sweetroot, canker root.

372
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,067
All traditional medicines.

373
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,067
They're drugs, basically.

374
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,608
Yeah.

375
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:09,525
But I have no clue
if they work or not.

376
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:14,483
I try them on myself, and I keep
the ones I think are good.

377
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:18,067
I'm hoping that I'll find
something that'll heal Ruri.

378
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,817
In fact, that's why I became
a sorcerer in the first place.

379
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,108
[RURI]
I'm grateful to you

380

for bringing me the healing
water from the hot springs.

It truly helps. Thank you.

We expected you yesterday.
Did something happen?

383
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,317
Heh. I accidentally fell
asleep on the way back home.

384
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
So I just spent the
night in the forest.

[TURQUOISE]
"Accidentally?" Give me a break.

Do you mind giving us
a moment, please?

I'd like to speak
to Kohaku in private.

Please, forgive us, Ruri.

We're not allowed to leave
the priestess by herself.

But Kohaku is my own flesh

You dummy, Kohaku!

Your hair is
knotted differently.

Something must've
happened to you

that caused your hair
to come undone.

Well, that depends on
