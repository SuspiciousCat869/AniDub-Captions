1
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,733
This small chunk
won't be enough,

2
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,983
but it came from
upstream in the cave,

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:17,525
so there's gotta be
more farther inside!

4
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,233
A bona fide treasure trove of
this heat-resistant tungsten!

5
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:23,525
We only have one
set of lights left,

6
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,900
so the last member of the
exploration team'll be...

7
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:30,858
[chuckles]

8
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:32,233
[SENKU]
Magma.

9
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,817
Tungsten's tough as hell,

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,233
so we're going to need your
brute force to collect it.

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,692
[SENKU chuckles]

12
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,900
We're a trio of
spelunking buddies.

13
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:43,275
You ready to go cave diving?

14
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:45,858
To the real live
treasure dungeon!

15
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,525
[KOHAKU]
Senku, Chrome, and Magma?

16
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:52,858
[SUIKA]
I don't know about this.

17
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,858
Sounds kinda dangerous to me.

18
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:57,692
[GINRO] Yeah, I mean, are you
sure this is a good idea?

19
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,442
He could be all like,
"I'm the chief now, Senku!"

20
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,067
and attack you or something!

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,442
We need to start moving,
A.S.A.P. All three of us.

22
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,942
We're gonna go down there and
mine the magic stone we need

23
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,483
for making vacuum
tube filaments.

24
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:15,067
Scheelite, which glows blue
under ultraviolet light.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,067
And from that, we'll get
the most heat-resistant metal

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,317
in the world: Tungsten!

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,650
And this little nugget is just a
taste of what's waiting for us.

28
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,233
There's gonna be a whole
bunch more down there!

29
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,108
[SENKU] I'm counting on you
to take us to the cave

30
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:28,900
and lead the expedition, Chrome.

31
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:30,733
[CHROME]
No problem!

32
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:34,358
[MAGMA] So it'll just be me and
those two science users, huh?

33
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,233
In a place where
nobody can see us...

34
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,858
[inaudible]

35
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:53,650
[GEN chuckles]

36
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,775
[SUIKA, KASEKI]
Hm?

37
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:59,317
It appears as though we've
finally gotten rid of Senku.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,733
Gone without a clue that he's
in for the surprise of his life.

39
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:49,192
[SENKU]
The water feels lukewarm.

40
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,775
[SENKU chuckles]

41
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:54,108
There's definitely gonna be
some treasures up ahead.

42
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,483
[CHROME]
Hey, Senku.

43
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,900
You sure about this? Was it
really a good idea to bring him?

44
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,775
He's just a big ape
who only cares

45
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,483
about being king of the hill.

46
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,108
I bet he's thinking right now
about how to kill you down here

47
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,692
so he can take over the village.

48
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,150
[SENKU chuckles]

49
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,108
[SENKU] Maybe, but either
way, we're still in a bind.

50
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:26,567
We can't make our cell phone
happen without this Tungsten.

51
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,692
There's a supply waiting for us
in the depths of this cave.

52
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:33,317
But Magma is the only one strong
enough to actually dig it out.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,317
The situation's ten
billion percent simple.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,900
It's our only choice,

55
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:41,025
so there's no use in worrying
about if it's the right choice.

56
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,900
I mean, that's really
all there is to it.

57
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,567
[CHROME]
Yeah, I know, but...

58
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,692
Magma could easily
push us into a hole

59
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,483
and say we died accidently.

60
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,983
It'd be the perfect crime.

61
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,317
Plus, if he takes our heads
as proof for Tsukasa

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,150
that science is
officially extinct,

63
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,192
they won't have to
worry about the war.

64
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,692
[SENKU]
Get real.

65
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,733
There's no way the big ape's
thought that far in advance.

66
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:05,233
[snickers]

67
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,650
[gasps]

68
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,983
[SENKU]
Stay back!

69
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,608
What is it? What's wrong?

70
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,150
[SENKU]
It's mica.

71
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:22,108
A lot like baumkuchen,
which you've never heard of.

72
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,983
The point is, it's a rock
that's brittle enough

73
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,942
to break with your fingers.

74
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:31,317
[SENKU] You see?
It forms natural pit traps.

75
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,692
[CHROME] Damn, nature's got
some bad ways to get ya.

76
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:38,442
So if you accidentally fell
into one, you couldn't get out?

77
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,692
For sure.

78
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,567
Try getting back up
with a rope or ladder

79
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,817
and it'll cave in on you
and bury you alive.

80
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,650
[crack]

81
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,525
[gasps]

82
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,608
[yells]

83
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:56,025
[gasps]

84
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,983
[screams]

85
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,733
[gasps]

86
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,900
[SENKU grunting]

87
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:04,650
Just let him go, Senku!

88
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,358
Or else you're gonna fall
in there with him!

89
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,567
You realize what
happened, don't you?

90
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,233
Magma tried to shove us
down into the mica pits!

91
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,108
He tried to kill us!

92
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,567
[laughs]

93
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,233
You better believe I did!

94
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,858
The only reason I came along is
to get rid of you two for good!

95
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:28,275
You little wimps act like
you're so big and important,

96
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,067
but you're completely useless!

97
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,483
You can't even hunt!

98
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,317
The strongest deserves
to be the chief

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,608
and get all the women.

100
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:37,692
That's how the whole
village gets stronger.

101
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:41,150
That's how life works.
It's how nature works!

102
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,775
"Science"?! Ha! My ass!

103
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,067
Maybe back in your world

104
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,317
the weak controlled
the strong, Senku,

105
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,358
but not in this one!

106
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,317
'Cause this is the Stone World!

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,942
And here, you're only
getting in my way!

108
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,817
Damn you, and damn your
stupid science, Senku.

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,733
If you'd never set foot in
Ishigami Village back then,

110
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,233
I'd be the one in
power right now.

111
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:07,400
Because I'm the strongest
out of everybody!

112
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,442
[MAGMA] I should be the
one calling the shots,

113
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,442
you understand me?!

114
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:20,775
No, Senku! Magma!

115
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,567
[SENKU]
Huh...

116
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,858
Hmm?

117
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:41,233
[growls]

118
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,067
Stop pacin' around, would ya?!

119
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,942
You're wearin' down
my last nerve!

120
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,817
I'm not pacing, I'm measuring.

121
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
You said there's no way
we're gettin' out of this hole,

122
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,358
so what's the point?

123
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,525
[SENKU]
It's not like sitting around

124
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,983
and waiting to die
will do us any good.

125
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,650
And if you keep shouting
like a dumbass,

126
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,692
the whole thing could cave in,
and then it's game over.

127
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,483
Yeah, yeah, know-it-all.

128
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,692
What the hell?! Is this
some kinda joke?!

129
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:08,983
I'll kill you!

130
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,358
Did you not hear me?

131
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:13,192
Keep on shouting and
you'll kill us, too.

132
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,942
[CHROME] If I can manage
to pour in enough water

133
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,400
from that pool over there,

134
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,650
you might be able to
swim your way out.

135
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:24,608
Oh, yeah?

136
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:25,733
Then why don't you
figure out a way

137
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,442
to pour it in here faster?

138
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,858
Slow and steady always
wins the race, right?

139
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,233
Just takes some diligence.

140
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:32,733
[SENKU chuckles]

141
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,400
[SENKU]
Hang on, that's not bad.

142
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:35,692
[CHROME, MAGMA]
Hm?

143
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,858
[SENKU] But I don't mean
that "where there's a will,

144
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,275
there's a way" crap.

145
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,150
The key to making
this work is science.

146
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,025
Connecting the gas mask
tubes will give us

147
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,358
a good meter of drop height
from the surface.

148
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:50,233
The diameter's two centimeters,
so by Torricelli's Law,

149
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:54,275
the flow will be .00139
cubic meters per second.

150
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,692
If the hole measures
28 cubic meters,

151
00:08:56,775 --> 00:09:00,650
that's 20,131.68 seconds.

152
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:04,233
Five and a half hours in
lukewarm water wouldn't kill us.

153
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:10,650
Hey, Chrome, if I tell you
how to craft something,

154
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,608
could you do that for me?

155
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:16,108
Yeah, of course I can, man.

156
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,567
I'm a science user,
so don't underestimate me!

157
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,442
[yells]

158
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,692
[SENKU chuckles]

159
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,233
What did I tell ya?

160
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,858
We'd be screwed if any
one of us was missing.

161
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:34,108
Huh?

162
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:35,817
Do you actually
believe that the weak

163
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,983
controlled the strong
back in my world?

164
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,150
That's obviously not the case.

165
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,483
We just split up the work.

166
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:46,317
In a technological civilization,
there are roles for the wimps

167
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,192
and roles for the brawny
meatheads like you.

168
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:53,733
Even someone who's got no real
special skill can come in handy.

169
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,858
It doesn't matter who's calling
the shots or who's tougher.

170
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,775
The fact is, there are all kinds
of people in the world,

171
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,108
and true strength happens when
everybody works together.

172
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,650
I don't wanna listen
to this crap.

173
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,900
My point is,

174
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,150
the throne shoulda been
mine and you took it.

175
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,525
End of story.

176
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,317
Yeah. I sure did.

177
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,608
But you do get something.

178
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,108
[SENKU]
With me here,

179
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,150
you get to see all the
ridiculously awesome stuff

180
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:29,358
that humanity worked together
for two million years to build.

181
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,567
And I'll show you enough
to make your head spin.

182
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:52,442
Huh? How the heck's the water
able to travel up like that?

183
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,775
Time for a grade school
science project.

184
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,358
We're making a siphon!

185
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,900
I'll explain for those
who don't know.

186
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,650
Now, the first step is to
fill up a tube with water.

187
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,108
Then put one of
the ends at a point

188
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,025
lower than the water's surface.

189
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:08,150
The water will then flow
upward in a steady stream.

190
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,858
You can even go over
to your bathtub

191
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,900
and give it a try right now.

192
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,983
[SENKU whimpering]

193
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,817
[CHROME]
Ah. This is bad.

194
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,442
It's gonna take a while longer
for the water to fill up,

195
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:26,275
but Senku can't take
much more of the cold.

196
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,025
You should go on and get
up there, ya little wimp

197
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,608
[SENKU]
Huh?!

198
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,358
I'm the strongest
guy in a village

199
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,233
that was built on the water.

200
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll get you there.

201
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,983
Senku!

202
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,358
I don't care if you're
in charge anymore.

203
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,817
At least, not until we deal
with that Tsukasa guy.

204
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,733
But if you stop showing me
awesome stuff, I'll kill you!

205
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,733
[MAGMA yells]

206
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,733
[screams]

207
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,692
All right. Sounds
like a plan to me.

208
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:08,775
Because there's no way science
isn't gonna be totally awesome.

209
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,150
[SENKU chuckles]

210
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,233
[SENKU] Thanks to
Magma's brute strength,

211
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:24,275
we were able to avoid
the worst-case scenario.

212
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:26,150
And by that, you mean...?

213
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,067
Obviously, he means dying,

214
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,108
which woulda happened
if he'd gotten colder.

215
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:33,775
This is why you runts
need meat on your bones.

216
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,692
You're wrong!

217
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,358
The worst-case scenario
I'm talking about

218
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:42,317
is that we both got colder
and colder until...

219
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,983
...we both got so cold we
had to hold each other tight

220
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,983
to preserve our body heat.

221
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,150
I think I would've been fine
without that mental image,

222
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,775
thank you very much.

223
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,025
[SENKU cackles]

224
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,442
[SENKU]
Just as I predicted.

225
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:28,692
[MAGMA, CHROME]
Huh?

226
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,025
[SENKU]
You see?

227
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,942
That striped rock face
is what I was looking for.

228
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,817
That tells me, this dungeon
we're in right now?

229
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,400
It's a skarn deposit!

230
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,567
We can get a ridiculous amount
of amazing minerals from this.

231
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,983
We're looking at nature's
treasure chest here!

232
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,733
[CHROME]
This is so bad!

233
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,192
White, black, blue, gold.

234
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:52,692
It's all separated so clearly
into those stripes!

235
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,358
I've never seen a rock
like this before!

236
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,275
Just looks like a rock.

237
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,358
[SENKU] The hot magma
underground boils water

238
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,025
that shoots up into the
cracks in the limestone,

239
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,983
the white rock that you see
all over the place down here.

240
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,817
That water has all kinds
of stuff inside it.

241
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,692
It seeps into the rock
and transforms it

242
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,983
into other kinds of rocks.

243
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,317
And that's how you get
a skarn deposit.

244
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,067
Nature's treasure chest.

245
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh, wow.

246
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,275
That's why only the parts
around the cracks

247
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,275
transform into those stripes.

248
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,983
[SENKU]
Even scientifically speaking,

249
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,275
you could say it was
the power of magma

250
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:30,775
that made it possible for us
to acquire these rare gems.

251
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:35,733
[SENKU]
All right, this is it.

252
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:39,275
The precious stones we're
after are inside this wall.

253
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,067
The rock is hard as hell,

254
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,358
which means us
wimps are useless.

255
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:45,108
No way we could dig 'em out.

256
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:48,858
[CHROME] Sounds like a job
for the strongest guy!

257
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,442
I didn't wanna
attack you head-on

258
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:54,567
and get countered by whatever
crazy science weapons you got.

259
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,025
But now you've handed
me a pickaxe.

260
00:14:57,108 --> 00:15:00,733
You two won't so much as flinch
when I raise this thing up.

261
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,650
You wouldn't dare, Magma!

262
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,233
Oh, you bet I would!

263
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,775
And you two idiots left
yourselves wide open for me

264
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,858
to strike a death blow while
your backs are turned!

265
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,900
[MAGMA] And I was gonna
murder you, too.

266
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,442
[chuckles] Yeah, sure.

267
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,233
Probably why you couldn't stop
yourself from saving me.

268
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:24,317
You kept me from falling
into the mica pit.

269
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,233
I know that you weren't
trying to shove me in.

270
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:30,233
You were actually trying
to push me outta the way.

271
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,317
[CHROME]
Magma.

272
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,317
[MAGMA]
Hm?

273
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,067
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,775
I insulted you. I shouldn't
have run my mouth.

275
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,817
So hit me, okay?

276
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,733
[MAGMA]
Ha! I don't care about that.

277
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,275
Because the fact is,
I was gonna kill you!

278
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,233
I just had a change of plans!

279
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,025
[CHROME yells]

280
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:09,608
[CHROME] The most heat-resistant
rock in the world... is ours!

281
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:14,900
[CHROME]
Yeah.

282
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:18,608
Tungsten's an
unbelievable treasure.

283
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,733
But in this dark, gloomy
dungeon full of treasures,

284
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,608
we found something more.

285
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm talking about the
precious treasure

286
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,775
that we call "friendship."

287
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,317
You really said that.
That's so lame.

288
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,150
Yeah. Super lame.

289
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,650
[CHROME]
Ah! Shut up!

290
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,525
I regretted it the exact moment
it came out of my mouth!

291
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:39,650
And what's the deal with you two

292
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,275
getting all buddy-buddy
over it, huh?

293
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,733
[CHROME]
Ah! This is bad!

294
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,358
There's way too
much treasure here!

295
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,733
Check this out!

296
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:50,025
We can make tons of batteries
with this manganese!

297
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,275
[SENKU laughs]

298
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,067
That's copper pyrite!
And lots of sphalerite!

299
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,067
It's still just a bunch
of damn rocks!

300
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,692
Now focus and finish up!

301
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,567
The sun's gonna set!

302
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,817
Be sure to get Senku back by
nightfall three days from now.

303
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,400
And then...

304
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,192
[grunts]

305
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,858
We're leaving, now!

00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,108

enjoy our treasure, okay?

[MAGMA growls]

309
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,567
[MAGMA]
I said, we're leaving!

310
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,275
And you little wimps can't
even carry that much!

311
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,233
Hurry up!

312
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,608
Why are you in such a rush
all of a sudden, anyway?

00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,525
[SENKU]
What the hell's going on?

315
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,775
[CHROME] Whoa, where are
you taking Senku? Hey!

316
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,567
Aw, you're back, Senku.
Welcome home.

317
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,233
Huh? What is is all this?

318
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,983
Ha. Now don't waste your breath
by crying out for help.

319
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,442
Everybody's working
together with Gen.

320
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,108
[chuckles]

321
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,650
I guess you sneaky bastards

322
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,608
finally figured out
the hack, did ya?

323
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,650
All you gotta do is present
my head to Tsukasa,

324
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,942
tell him science is dead,
and the village is safe.

325
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,858
Perfectly logical.

326
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,900
[sighs]

327
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,192
I honestly don't have a clue
as to what you're talking about.

328
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:49,400
[SENKU]
You made... a telescope.

329
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:53,775
No, you made a
whole observatory.

330
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,775
I'm going to space.

331
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:17,858
[laughs]

332
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:20,150
January 4th is Stone Day!

333
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,317
Today's your birthday,
isn't it, Senku?

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,858
This is your gift.

335
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:27,400
[SUIKA] And everybody chipped
in to help make it for you!

336
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:37,983
It appears as though we've
finally gotten rid of Senku.

337
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:41,692
[GEN] Everyone! I have
an awesome idea!

338
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:45,817
But I'm gonna need your
help to make it happen!

339
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,692
[GEN] I mean, I just kinda
remembered that you

340
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,983
can put two lenses in a tube
and fashion a telescope.

341
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,650
I'll admit it's half-assed,
but whatever.

342
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,692
[RURI]
Hey!

343
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,858
I have a crew here that
would love to help out.

344
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,275
Well, I'm hoping that
ol' Senku sees all this

345
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,733
and decides to get me something

346
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:10,025
even more awesome
for my birthday.

347
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,608
We're putting in a lot of
hard and sweaty labor.

348
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,775
Yeah.

349
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,775
[GEN] The whole village
worked really hard

350
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,275
to put this together.

351
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:22,067
But I trust you can handle
all the fine tuning yourself.

352
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,483
[MANTLE]
Yeah.

353
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,483
Uh-oh! What's wrong, Senku?

354
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,858
Are you actually
moved by all of this?

355
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,858
Even you're allowed
to cry, ya know?

356
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,442
You don't have to
hold it in. So...

357
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,650
Why do you always have
to be like this, Ginro?

358
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Excellent job, everybody!
This is extremely practical!

359
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,192
We can use it on our watchtower
to keep an eye on Tsukasa.

360
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,483
Uh, yeah. That's true.

361
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,983
Good to see you can still
keep your emotions in check.

362
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,483
[chuckles]

363
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,150
[SENKU] I'm not the type
of guy that would ever

364
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,942
bring up his own birthday.

365
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,733
Not my style.

366
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,692
How did you know it was today?

367
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,483
My internal clock is messed up.

368
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,400
Must be due to
the petrification.

369
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:08,983
I couldn't even tell you
how old I am anymore.

370
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,650
Don't you know how many
days you've been alive?

371
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,442
You don't, right, Senku?

372
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:16,358
Six thousand, two hundred
and sixty-eight.

373
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,608
Ah. You baited me
with that question.

374
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,900
Still, it would be impossible
for you to figure it out

375
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,358
if you didn't know
when I revived.

376
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,317
Do you not remember?

377
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,775
You wrote down the date you
broke out of the stone.

378
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,025
[GEN] Right by the entrance
to the miracle cave.

379
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:37,817
It was probably the
first thing you did.

380
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:43,025
[GEN] So he wrote this
when he was depetrified?

381
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,525
How did he know what day it was?

382
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:49,567
No way. Was he...?
The whole time?

383
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,108
This guy is freaking azy-cray!

384
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,400
Who does that?

385
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:57,858
[GEN] Come to think of it,
ever since the beginning,

386
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,608
even before I met you...

387
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:04,442
Let me put it this way,
I was a big fan.

388
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:07,150
No matter what side we're on.

389
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:11,608
And I'm not the only one.
The whole village agrees.

390
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:14,525
You might think that's kinda
lame to say, though.

391
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:20,983
[SENKU]
Yeah. Just a little bit.

392
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,483
[GEN]
Called it.
