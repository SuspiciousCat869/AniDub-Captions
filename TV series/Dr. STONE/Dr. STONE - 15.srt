00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:13,442
I think it's best if I
leave the village for now.

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,233
I'm an outsider, and I'm
not competing, so...

00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,733
I bet our Kinro would
throw a fit if I didn't.

[GEN] I came here to have a
little chat with you, Senku,

but I'll be patient.

7
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,025
We can discuss your
end of the deal

00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,900
after you've taken
over the village.

00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,150
Sure.

Ruri--Priestess, I mean.

00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,775
You're gonna have to
marry the winner, right?

13
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:41,442
Well, don't worry.
It's down to us three.

14

And Senku and I are just
gonna throw our matches.

15
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:46,567
So Chrome's already won.

Don't act so surprised.
It's pretty obvious.

I can tell that you've
been rooting for him.

Nice job figuring
out the difference

[RURI]
No.

As the priestess, I am
but a servant of the gods.

22
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,108
I cannot favor anyone.

23

I will simply marry
whoever wins.

That's weird, I coulda
sworn you-- Whoa, hang on!

Whaddya mean?

You heard the girl!
Ruri said she'd marry anyone!

40
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,275
That means even I could
be the village chief!

My time has come!
It's the era of Ginro!

No! You've gotta be kidding me!

[VILLAGERS] We can't let him
become the village chief.

We have to take him
down as soon as possible.

supposed to do that?

Yeah.

And now we can turn this village
into a Kingdom of Science.

73
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,317
And we... can save Ruri...

74
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,483
All right, it's the last round.

75
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,275
So now all that's left for me
to do is throw the match.

76
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:51,692
Then, Chrome, you'll marry Ruri
and become the village chief.

Okay. He is completely
conked out.

Maybe the tension was
keeping him awake.

But once Ruri was safe,
it all went away.

Well, great. This just got a
hell of a lot more annoying.

94
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,317
So just to be clear,
if I were to marry Ruri,

95
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,317
then this entire village
is mine, is that right?

Hold it, Senku! Where did
you even come from, huh?

let you become our chief!

My, my. If it isn't the former
village chief himself!

To tell you the truth, I don't
have a millimeter of interest

102
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,483
in your lack of approval.

we supposed to side with?

We side with Kokuyo, obviously!

Do I really have to
spell it out for you?

But the gods are watching,

107

Ha-ha! And I nailed it

Pretty cool, huh? Are you

[SENKU]
Impressive.

Thank you. But I wasn't
trying to charm you.

00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:31,025
[GEN] So... what does
this allow us to make?

00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:34,692
Well, I know it spins,

Hey, you! Want me to

We're gonna need you on

We don't have much time left.

181
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,942
All we have to do is put
everything together

182
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,067
and we're done.

By morning tomorrow,

The cure-all sulfa drug.

00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:30,650
Tomorrow?!

00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,400
That quickly?!

[SENKU]
Fun with Making Sulfa Drugs.

188
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,025
Step one.

189
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:40,442
First, we're using a burnable
rock called coal to--

[CHROME]
Burnable rocks?

Got it. I've got plenty
of that stuff!

192
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:45,858
Uh.

00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:47,442
[wheezes]

194
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,775
Yeah, I sorta figured we
must've used it all up

195
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,983
when we made iron.

196
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,733
That's bad!

197
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,067
[SENKU chuckles]

198
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,400
Don't worry about it.

199
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,067
If we need more ordinary
coal like what you had,

200
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,900
we'll just take a quick
trip up to the mountains.

201
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,858
But for now, we don't
even need the coal itself.

202
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:07,858
We need the coal tar that's
left after it's burned.

203
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,900
Just wash it with
hydrochloric acid,

204
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,942
then throw in ethyl acetate
made from alcohol and vinegar,

205
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,608
and we've got aniline.

00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,650
Uh. Wait, wait, wait, slow down!

207
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,233
You lost me like
five sentences ago!

208
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,733
If that's all step one,
and we're done by tomorrow,

209
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,525
how many total steps are there?

210
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,775
Like three or four?

00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:28,983

Hmm... Oh, only 25, maybe?

Yeah. For sure.

Nobody else can.

228
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,608
Just what have you
gotten up to this time?

229
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,983
[chuckles]

230
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,733
Nothin' special really.
Only mixin' stuff together.

231
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,275
Poured vinegar on burned shells,

232
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,358
extracted glacial acetic
acid using sulfuric acid,

233
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,192
turned it into ketene
in an iron pipe,

234
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,192
and put it back to make
acetic anhydride.

235
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:11,108
Uh. Oh. Very interesting.

236
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:14,483
So I tried to drip that acetic
anhydride into the aniline,

237
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,608
but I poured in way too much...

238
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:17,942
...and kaboom.

239
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,275
[GEN]
I see. Hence, the wreckage.

240
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,983
Mix the chlorosulfuric acid into
the acetanilide we just made

241
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:27,525
for para-acetamido-
benzene-sulfonyl chloride.

242
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,067
And then, throw in ammonia

243
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,983
to make para-acetamido-
benzene-sulfonic acid,

244
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:35,108
cook it in hydrochrolic
acid, 'nd get that.

245
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm genuinely impressed you can
say that without stuttering.

00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,233
Good job.

247
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,275

Lastly, that carbonated water.

248
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:43,108
Oh, yes, I meant to ask.

249
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,900
I'm not expecting anything,

I have no earthly idea.

252
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,900
Mix it with sodium hydroxide
to make baking soda!

00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:58,025
Baking soda. Yes,
right. That's it.

254
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,900
That's definitely
what I was thinking.

255
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:03,525

Step 25, we wash this stuff

256

257
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,567
And then we sit back and wait.

258
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,317
This is it.

259
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,150
[CHROME] It took a long,
bad half-year.

260
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,233
It's sulfanilamide.

Or you could say...
the fruits of our labor.

00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,317
And even the rats
are catching it.

317
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,942
We gotta narrow it down more.

318
00:17:58,025 --> 00:17:59,608
[CHROME, KOHAKU]
Huh?

319
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,900
[SENKU] Even our cure-all
has its limits.

320
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:03,817
It's not ten billion
percent guaranteed

321
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,775
that it'll wipe out this
specific bacteria.

322
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,275
And in the worst case scenario,

323
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,317
if we're up against
tuberculosis,

324
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,358
then frankly, we don't
stand a chance in hell.

325
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,525
[SUIKA] Quick! You guys
gotta come with me!

326
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:24,400
It's Ruri! She's gotten worse!

327
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,900
Don't get up!

328
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:28,400
Just stay on your side like this
and try to breathe slowly.

329
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,608
It's never been this bad. Never.

330
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,483
I can't help but fear
the worst here.

331
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,817
She had that white powder,
and now this starts happening?

332
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,067
I knew not to trust them
and their sorcery medicine.

333
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,317
--[CHROME] Ruri, we're here!
--Just hang in there!

334
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,900
Uh, Senku?

335
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,900
Senku, you bastard!

336
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,567
This is all because
of that drug!

337
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,400
Father!

338
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,983
If you didn't give her that,

339
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:04,067
Ruri wouldn't have taken such
a drastic turn for the worse!

340
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,858
Yeah. You might be right.

341
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:07,900
[ALL gasp]

342
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,858
So you admit it.

343
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,692
[SENKU] The bacteria is
getting serious now.

344
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:15,275
It's making allies by
spreading its toxic genes

345
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,400
into all the harmless
bacteria around it.

346
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:24,275
It's the signature move of
the pneumococcus bacteria.

347
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:29,733
Which means that Ruri's
disease is... pneumonia.

348
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:31,858
And that's nothing to laugh at.

349
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:33,733
It's a deadly disease
with a kill count

350
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,983
in the hundreds of millions.

351
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:42,608
But... sulfa drugs absolutely
slaughter pneumococcus bacteria.

352
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:47,317
Which means that we won! With
the power of humanity's science!

353
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,025
Now that we know what it is,
we've got the upper hand.

354
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,275
All that's left is to pump her
full of more sulfa drugs.

355
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,400
Enough of your trickery!

356
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:57,608
[KOHAKU]
Father!

357
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:59,567
This is nothing like
the fraudulent sorcery

358
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,983
that you know.

359
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,858
It's science. The culmination
of human wisdom.

360
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,942
And I believe in it.

361
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,900
I trust and believe
in Senku, too.

362
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:16,025
That's right! So do I!

363
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,692
Not entirely sure why,
but I kind of do, too.

364
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,858
[SENKU chuckles]

365
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:36,150
I gotta say, it's a miracle
that Ruri managed to live to 18.

366
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,358
But if you stay clean
and keep warm,

367
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:41,483
the disease's progression
slows significantly.

368
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
[SENKU]
Turns out that hot spring water

369
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:48,525
that Kohaku hauled in every day

370
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,650
ended up helping her sister
a lot more than she knew.

371
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,692
Ruri.

372
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:09,192
Ruri!

373
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:13,233
[KOKUYO crying]

374
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,692
[inaudible]

375
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,983
I can't even remember how
many years it's been

376
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:43,400
since I've left the village
or been able to run!

377
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:44,942
[KOKUYO, TURQUOISE, JASPER gasp]

378
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,817
I know that rambunctiousness.

379
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,192
It must've actually run
in the family all along.

380
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:54,608
[KOKUYO]
Everyone!

381
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,525
As of now, this man
known as Senku

382
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,650
is pronounced the new chief
of Ishigami Village!

383
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,650
[VILLAGERS cheering]

384
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,817
[SENKU]
Ishigami Village?

385
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,817
[RURI]
That's right Senku.

386
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:13,817
I know of you. I have
for a long, long time.

387
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,983
Since I was a child.

388
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:22,150
[RURI] Your full name...
is Ishigami Senku.
