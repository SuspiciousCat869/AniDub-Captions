1
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:14,608
[SENKU] When I first became
interested in science,

2
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:17,733
I read a biography
about Thomas Edison.

3
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,150
[SENKU] What the heck is
electricity, anyway?

4
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,775
[SENKU] Wow, so there are
only four fundamental forces

5
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,192
in the universe?

6
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,317
Gravitational...

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,067
Five plus three, equals...

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,317
[SENKU] ...and then "strong
force" and "weak force."

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,692
[SENKU chuckles]

10
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,692
That sounds ridiculously weird.

11
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,358
[SENKU]
So in the entire universe,

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,900
electricity is like,
the most essential power.

13
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,358
That gets me excited!

14
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,150
[SENKU] I was reborn
into a primitive world,

15
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,900
butt naked and completely alone.

16
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:19,858
But a year and four months
into my scientific journey...

17
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:26,692
[SENKU] ...I've reached the
essential power: Electricity.

18
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:35,650
[SENKU] I gotta say,
I'm off to a damn good start.

19
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,150
[GEN] Man, electricity
in the stone age!

20
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,108
It's hard to believe.

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,608
[GEN]
Right, Tsukasa?

22
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,733
[KOHAKU]
So you see, Suika,

23
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,650
the long-haired man, Tsukasa,

24
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,775
is the one who was
behind Senku's murder.

25
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:43,900
[SENKU chuckles]

26
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,442
Even though I'm still alive.

27
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,817
That guy's seriously bad news.

28
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,025
He wanted to stop
scientific progress,

29
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:53,150
and that's why he killed
Senku without hesitation.

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,317
Even though I'm still alive.

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,358
So if this Tsukasa is some
kinda violent bad guy,

32
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,358
and Gen has been
working with him,

33
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,775
that means Gen's a bad guy, too!

34
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:07,608
But isn't Gen also the person
who saved us from Magma?

35
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:08,942
Then he's a good guy!

36
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,108
[SENKU chuckles]

37
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:12,525
He's honestly not a good
guy or a bad guy.

38
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,358
He's nothing but a rat who's
only in it for himself.

39
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,108
It actually doesn't matter
to me if he's good or bad.

40
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,525
At the end of the day,

41
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,275
we need him to be an ally
of the Kingdom of Science.

42
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:24,900
We'll have him give a
bogus report to Tsukasa,

43
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:27,608
saying "Senku is
definitely dead."

44
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,983
That's the only possible hope
we have of winning this.

45
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,233
[CHROME]
Listen up, Gen!

46
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,108
I know you saw the
electricity! The light!

47
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,733
That's what badass science
at work looks like!

48
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,858
So why care about who wins?

49
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:42,942
Why even give a crap

50
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,817
whether Senku or Tsukasa
has the edge?

51
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,358
'Cause the Kingdom of
Science is obviously

52
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,317
the side that's more fun!

53
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,567
Oh, is that so? You are
the passionate type.

54
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,525
Too bad for you, I don't
really care about that.

55
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:02,692
I'm probably the most
superficial man on Earth.

56
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:05,692
All I consider is what's
beneficial to me.

57
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,858
[GEN]
Uh. Uhh...

58
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,442
What is this, some
kind of prank?

59
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,608
I'll have to have a word
with my manager.

60
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,650
They should understand
that I'm a mentalist.

61
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,900
Doing a show where I'm
the target of a prankster

62
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,400
goes against my image.

63
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:42,483
Welcome to the year 5739 A.D.

64
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,775
Though the year has changed,
you're still only 19.

65
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,317
Say what?

66
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,733
Hold on.

67
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,567
You were on the special
about psychological magic.

68
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,692
We did that gig together.

69
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:57,983
[GEN]
I believe you were called

70
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,692
the "strongest primate
high-schooler."

71
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,817
Shishio Tsukasa!

72
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,400
I've made a choice.

73
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,358
You and all of these statues
are among the people

74
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,525
who I believe should
be revived first.

75
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,233
I've gathered all of
you into one place.

76
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:15,525
[gasps]

77
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,733
Those dusty old fossils
who used to be in power

78
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:31,650
are even less necessary in
this natural world of stone.

79
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,650
But I see a massive amount
of potential in you, Gen.

80
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,900
[TSUKASA] There's something
I need you for,

81
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,150
and your skills as a mentalist
will be invaluable.

82
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:49,567
Follow them for me, and
get inside of their minds.

83
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,442
Perhaps I'm being
overly cautious,

84
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,692
but I want you to track
down this man Senku

85
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:56,858
and tell me if he's dead
or hiding out somewhere.

86
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,483
[GEN]
Who is Senku?

87
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,150
[TSUKASA] He was the
first of us to revive.

88
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,733
He used his knowledge of science

89
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,983
to create a formula to
undo the petrification.

90
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,858
That's how he revived me.

91
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:13,567
This man--his only desire
is to revive everyone,

92
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,483
no matter who they were.

93
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,900
He'll bring back the same
people who ruined our world,

94
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:20,608
and they'll make weapons.

95
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:23,483
He was the most
intelligent man alive,

96
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,275
and that's why I
killed him myself.

97
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,692
[gasps]

98
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:53,358
Who are...?

99
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,108
[GEN]
Why?

100
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,067
[KOHAKU]
What was that noise?

101
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,150
[BOTH gasp]

102
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,108
Holy crap, what
happened here?

103
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,692
Damn it. Looks like
he died instantly.

104
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,567
This is horrible!

105
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,442
Hang on a second!

106
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,900
[SENKU] He protected himself
with fake blood bags.

107
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,150
He's got these things
all over his body!

108
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,150
This is really freakin' bad!

109
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,483
I bet he did this

110
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,900
before he even came to
the village, just in case.

111
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:35,150
Tch. That's pretty
impressive, Gen.

112
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,525
You really are a magician
to your core.

113
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,442
Not to mention a showman.

114
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,483
[KOHAKU] Those bags may have
helped block the spear,

115
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,442
but he's still really beat up.

116
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,400
Damn it. We gotta
catch whoever did this.

117
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:51,775
First, we need to find out
who'd do such an awful thing.

118
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:56,900
[SENKU]
Huh?

119
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,275
[SUIKA]
I'm gonna investigate!

120
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,775
[SUIKA] Big news, guys!
I found out something huge!

121
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,108
Excellent work,
Great Detective Suika.

122
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,817
Do you mind tellin'
us what it is?

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,358
I figured out who
attacked Gen last night!

124
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,233
I know who killed him!

125
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,108
[KOHAKU]
Uh, you know, he's not dead.

126
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:36,317
[SENKU]
Well, so who was it?

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,192
[SUIKA]
It was...!

128
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,900
[laughing]

129
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,567
Now that I've killed
that sorcerer,

130
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,358
I'm the most powerful one!

131
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,817
Everyone should fear Magma!

132
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,483
I thought he'd put up
more of a fight,

133
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,900
but that was as easy as
taking a toy from a baby!

134
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,858
Oh, yeah! I bet it
was easy for you!

135
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,525
[MAGMA] Would've been better
to go on and kill Kohaku, too.

136
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,900
But that woman never seems
to let her guard down.

137
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,567
Well, I think that she's way
too strong to be a normal woman.

138
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,900
The only explanation has to
be some kinda sorcery.

139
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,400
[MAGMA laughs]

140
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,858
[MAGMA] But now that I've gotten
rid of her powerful ally,

141
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:14,733
she's just like every
other little girl.

142
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:17,192
[chuckles]

143
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,983
Though if she begs
me to spare her,

144
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,733
I wouldn't mind letting
her join her sister,

145
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,900
and both of them
can be my women.

146
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,733
[MANTLE] I don't know
who would be luckier.

147
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:28,442
You having both sisters,
or them having the great Magma!

148
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:29,358
[MAGMA, MANTLE laughing]

149
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,525
[SUIKA]
This is really bad news!

150
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,067
[MAGMA, MANTLE laughing]

151
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,692
It was Magma? That bastard!

152
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:36,608
I see.

153
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,025
When Magma came over here,

154
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:41,025
Gen made those flowers
vanish right before his eyes.

155
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,108
I imagine from his perspective,

156
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,358
Gen has to be the mysterious
foreign sorcerer

157
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,483
that I had tried to bring
into the village.

158
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,983
So Magma tried to murder Gen

159
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,733
because he mistook
him for Senku?

160
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,983
Heh.

161
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,067
What's more offensive
is Magma has the nerve

162
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,817
to go around saying that my
strength comes from sorcery!

163
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,858
Well, I always thought
you had the strength

164
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:02,567
of a gorilla because
you were one.

165
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:05,817
[CHROME]
Sorry, ma'am.

166
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,025
Got a question for ya, Kohaku.

167
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:12,608
Why would Magma be looking
for an opportunity to kill you?

168
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:16,108
It's probably because--
no, it's definitely

169
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,858
because of the Grand Bout.

170
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:20,483
Once every generation,

171
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,817
the village holds a big
martial arts battle.

172
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,442
It's a tradition called
the Grand Bout.

173
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,608
[SENKU] So that explains
the thing on the far island

174
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,650
that looks like an arena.

175
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,983
[KOHAKU] The last one
was several months ago,

176
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,525
on the day that my sister,
the village priestess Ruri,

177
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,108
came of age.

178
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,608
[KOHAKU]
Whoever won the Grand Bout

179
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:45,108
was supposed to marry her and
become the next village chief.

180
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:48,275
That's how my father became
the current village chief.

The winner is Magma!

Moving on to the final round.

185
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,358
Damn, man. Magma's an
unstoppable force of nature!

186
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,525
Oh, yeah!

187
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,442
[RURI coughing]

188
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,775
Ruri!

189
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,192
Hey, Ruri! Are you okay?

190
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,692
[TURQUOISE]
Stop right there!

191
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,317
You know you can't just casually
walk up to the priestess!

[CHROME gasps]

193
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:22,983
Ruri? Bet she's got one
more year, at most.

194
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,775
I don't want that
kinda hassle.

195
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,275
If she just went
ahead and croaked,

196
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:29,692
I could take over as chief
without having to deal with her.

197
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,817
I could make it look
like she drowned.

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,067
Everyone would
think her sickness

199
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,775
drove her to throw
herself off a cliff.

Have mercy on me!

203
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,150
The winner of the
Grand Bout is Kohaku!

204
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,358
Magma, I cannot allow
you to marry Ruri!

205
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:52,608
A man like you doesn't even
deserve to be in her presence!

206
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:53,983
[MAGMA]
I get it now.

207
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:57,317
Kohaku joined the Grand
Bout just to get in my way!

208
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,942
Does anybody know what's
gonna happen now?

209
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,025
I mean, the rules do say
that whoever wins

210
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:03,817
is supposed to marry Ruri.

211

[GINRO gasps]

212
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,817
I guess that means
Ruri and Kohaku

213
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,108
will just have to marry
each other then!

214
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,650
That's super forbidden love!

215
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,150
[TURQUOISE]
Obviously not!

216

My word. What should we do now?

217
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,733
Who's going to marry
Priestess Ruri?

Hilarious.

I bet your old man disavowed
you after that little stunt.

221
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,025
Well, let's just say
that was the final straw

222
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,192
that broke his patience.

223
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,483
Kohaku's given the chief
a lotta headaches.

224
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,608
She's been that way
her whole life.

225
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,817
[KOHAKU]
Of course, the Grand Bout

226
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,608
ended up getting rescheduled.

227
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,275
There'll be another
one next month.

228

[CHROME] Are you saying the
real reason Magma killed Gen

229
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:42,567
is so he can win the Grand Bout?

230

[SUIKA] What?! Gen really
is dead? That's horrible!

231

[KOHAKU]
No, he's still alive.

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,233
Oh, man, it would be bad news
if Magma became the new chief.

233
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:53,400
[SENKU]
Yeah.

234
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,942
With a guy like Magma
in that position,

235
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,900
getting the medicine to
Ruri will prove to be

236
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,608
even more difficult
than it already is.

237
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:03,108
Heh. I see it as an opportunity.

238
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,483
If a man from the Kingdom of
Science were to beat Magma

239
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,692
and win the Grand Bout,

240
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,733
they'd marry Ruri and
become the chief.

241
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,775
That would fix everything.

242
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:13,233
It would mean more people
in the Kingdom of Science,

243
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,983
and make it easy to get
the medicine to Ruri.

Listen up, guys, I have an
important question for you.

What do you think about Ruri?

Do either one of you
want her to be your wife?

I mean, Ruri is super pretty.

Kinda looks like
you, but better.

252
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:42,025
First off, she's way got
way bigger, I mean--

253
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:45,150
She's just so graceful and
cute, with big, round eyes!

254
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,358
There's more to a woman
than how she looks.

255
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,858
Is her appearance really
all you care about?

256

I had no idea you were
so shallow, Ginro.

Hey, you heard me.

I said... she had a bigger
amount of grace about her.

I have a very simple answer.
Guards don't have discussions.

The rules are the rules.

But listening to one
murmur to themselves

is not against the rules.

definitely not an evil person.

she's apologizing is because

00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,150
Is he all right?
He looks way worse.

315
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,525
I think he'll be fine,

316
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,650
but his recovery's gonna
take longer than we thought.

317
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,067
And that means...

318
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,608
Yeah.

319
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:04,442
It won't be long before Tsukasa
comes around lookin' for me,

320
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,650
and then kills me for real.

321
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,983
[inaudbile]

322
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:28,650
[inaudbile]

323
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,108
[inaudbile]

324
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,525
[GINRO]
I'm still sleepy.

325
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,192
Well, it's time to wake up.

326
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,900
We agreed to do training
in the morning

327
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:49,817
until we rotate on guard duty.

328
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,733
[CHROME]
This is bad!

329
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,400
Gen's not here!
He vanished somehow!

330
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:03,608
Yeah, well. It's obvious where
he went. Back to Tsukasa.

331
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,942
But why? Why sneak
out like that?

332
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,067
I bet that rat's gonna snitch.

333
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,525
He's gonna go and tell Tsukasa
that Senku is still alive!

334
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,067
Not good, Senku. We have
to try and stop him!

335
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:34,858
[gasps]

336
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,942
Wait, Tsukasa! It's me!

337
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:43,775
[GEN] I found a village.
Full of primitives.

338
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,317
[GEN]
They attacked me,

339
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,650
and I ended up getting a little
banged up in the process.

340
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,608
But I did manage to
find out about Senku.

341
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,525
We have to catch that
bastard, right now!

342
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:01,900
[SENKU]
No, stop!

343
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,358
What are you doing, Senku?

344
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,400
If we don't catch him,
it's game over for you!

345
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:14,317
I'm just saying, I think we
can let him be for now.

346
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,900
Look at it this way.

347
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,692
If Gen really didn't
have a millimeter

348
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,358
of interest in science,

349
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,400
he never would've cooperated
in the first place.

350
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,483
He made up his mind about
what side he was on

351
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,567
the moment I made electricity.

352
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,442
That's what got him.

353
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:33,858
But he's still a completely
superficial man to his core.

354
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,733
So he ran away
to give us a show.

355
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:38,192
[groans] You men.

356
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:42,233
Such a pain in the ass.
No matter what era.

357
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,442
[GEN] Ah. This ramen is
making me wickedly thirsty.

358
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,442
A cola would be great.

359
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:55,483
[GEN] Even in this Stone World
could you make one for me?

360
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,150
Just one cola?

361
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:07,567
Yeah. For sure. Nobody else can.

362
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,817
[GEN]
Senku... was gone.

363
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,150
No trace of him anywhere.

364
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:25,233
There's no doubt.
He's definitely not alive.

365
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,858
Whoa! So Gen's gonna join
the Kingdom of Science?

366
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,442
Yeah.

367
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,525
He'll come back before too long
and act like nothin' happened.

368
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:33,650
Heh.

369
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,858
Well, I guess that
was our first battle

370
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,650
against the Tsukasa Empire.

371
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,858
In the fight over Asagiri Gen,

372
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,233
the Kingdom of Science
claims victory!

373
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,775
[SUIKA] Gen turned out to
be a good guy after all!

374
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:46,400
[CHROME]
Yeah!

375
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,983
[SENKU] It's the world's
most flimsy alliance.

376
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,775
Bound by a single
bottle of cola.

377
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:56,442
[GEN] Man, this isn't
worth all the trouble.

378
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,942
For just one bottle of cola?

379
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:04,233
I hope it's ice cold. That's
the very least he could do.

380
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:08,025
Tch. So my next step is to
use my knowledge of science

381
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:10,108
to make him an ice cold cola.

382
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:11,525
And I would love
to have it ready

383
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,817
by the time he makes it back.
