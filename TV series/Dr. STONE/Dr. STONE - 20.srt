1
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:11,942
We're gonna make
cellular phones,

2
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:15,192
with service even
in the Stone World.

3
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,817
Granted, this'll be more
like a regular phone,

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,567
not necessarily the smart kind.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,483
[laughs]

6
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,775
We can do this!

7
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,150
That sulfa drug was
a hell of a lotta work,

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,317
but we made that
happen, didn't we?

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,650
No offense, guys,

10
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,858
but I don't think you
realize what he's saying.

11
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,400
This road map's full of things
that are impossible to get.

12
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,442
[SENKU chuckles]

13
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:39,942
Nothing is impossible, Gen.

14
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,567
No matter how far off
the goal may seem,

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,233
if you follow the steps,

16
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,900
you'll get there ten billion
percent of the time.

17
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,608
That's how science works.

18
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:54,150
Now, we'll only have
a few months to finish it.

19
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,150
[KOHAKU]
Hm? Why do you say that?

20
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:59,650
Because that's when Tsukasa's
assault is gonna start.

21
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,483
That sound about
right, mentalist?

22
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:06,150
Let me think. If I put
myself in Tsukasa's brain...

23
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:14,025
We're in total control
of the revival fluid.

24
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,025
So as the time passes,
our manpower grows.

25
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,275
Yes. But our main foe is Senku.

26
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:21,983
If we give him too much time,

27
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:24,442
he'll find a way to
mass-produce gunpowder.

28
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,733
[KOHAKU, CHROME gasp]

29
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:29,442
It's like he's here.
Your imitation's dead on.

30
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,608
[TSUKASA] We'll need to
take every precaution

31
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,858
to ensure that we defeat Senku.

32
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,400
But we can't let ourselves
forget that preparing for winter

33
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:42,942
is going to take a
good deal of manpower.

34
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,817
Also, if I understand
your report correctly,

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,067
this "Kingdom of Science" is
basically a floating fortress.

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,525
[HYOGA]
That's right.

37
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:51,733
It's surrounded by a lake

38
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:54,233
that mostly freezes
over in the winter.

39
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:57,608
If they bolster their defenses,
it will be difficult to attack,

40
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:01,733
and we are ill-prepared
for a proper siege.

41
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,150
[CHROME]
I have a question.

42
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:06,150
So, like, once Tsukasa finds
out you're still alive,

43
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,400
won't Taiju and
Yuzuriha be in danger?

44
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,525
A guy like him would
kill them, right?

45
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,150
Nah. That won't be an issue.

46
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,692
They're more useful
as potential hostages.

47
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,233
So killing them
would be a waste.

48
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,025
[HYOGA] Is it safe to allow
Taiju and Yuzuriha

49
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,692
to roam around freely?

50
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,233
[TSUKASA]
They'll be monitored.

51
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,650
But let's continue
interacting with them

52
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,942
as we've been doing.

53
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,108
We can't have them
getting suspicious.

54
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:35,983
Even if those two do turn out
to be spies, in this world,

55
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,025
there's no way for them to
quickly relay information.

56
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:44,858
No, what I think is a
more pressing concern...

57
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,692
...is a pre-emptive
attack from the enemy.

58
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,233
[HYOGA] Homura is keeping
close watch on them.

59
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,025
Although we have the same
issue you just mentioned.

60
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:56,317
There is a significant delay
in getting information.

61
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,858
[HYOGA]
It's almost funny.

62
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:03,567
In this primitive battle,
with no technology to rely on,

63
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,108
communication and
information transfer speed

64
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,775
are all the more crucial.

65
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,025
[chuckles]

66
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,608
The rules of the game
are pretty simple.

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,233
And the advantage
belongs to the side

68
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,150
who can launch the first strike.

69
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:19,525
So we'll create a cell phone
to make that happen.

70
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,942
After the winter snow's melted,

71
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,983
that's when the
battle will begin.

72
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,108
We've got a hard spring
deadline. Let's go!

73
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,275
Having so many people help out
sure makes a big difference.

74
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,817
More of 'em are
willing to pitch in

75
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,067
now that Senku is
the village chief.

76
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,317
Yeah, well, we really
do need it.

77
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,358
Because making a cell
phone in the Stone World

78
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,067
is not an easy task.

79
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,608
It's our biggest project so far!

80
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,275
There's a mountain's
worth of hurdles

81
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,192
we're gonna need to clear.

82
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,567
Oh, man, I am dying to know

83
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,067
how this cell phone thing
lets you talk to someone

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,692
who's crazy far away like that!

85
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,108
You gotta tell me
how it works, Senku!

86
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,983
Come on, stop
holding out on me!

87
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,567
Tell me how the
dang thing works,

88
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,525
but don't forget to
keep it simple, boy!

89
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,567
Back up! Stop crowding me!

90
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,400
And try to calm down
a little, okay?

91
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,483
[SENKU]
Ahh...

92
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:47,775
[SENKU]
Listen, the sound of your voice

93
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,942
is really just a vibration
of air, understand?

94
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,192
Now, if you point that
air at a diaphragm,

95
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,400
it'll produce a super
tiny electrical current

96
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,358
in rhythm with the vibration.

97
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,233
That's bad!

98
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,525
That's bad!

99
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,692
That's bad! That's bad...

100
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,858
[SENKU] The current is
way too small, of course,

101
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:07,317
so you need to blow it
up and make it bigger.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,067
To do that, we'll use
a vacuum tube.

103
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,358
Then, we move that current
around and around in a circle

104
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,608
until we've made
it strong enough

105
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:17,942
to travel through
the air like a wave.

106
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:21,108
We call that a radio wave.

107
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:25,608
Now the exact opposite process
happens on the listening side.

108
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,858
[CHROME]
That's bad!

109
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,192
Okay, then.

110
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:31,275
I think I could understand
about half of that.

111
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,233
[KASEKI laughs]

112
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:33,775
Half more than me.

113
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,358
This high IQ talk seems
to cause more confusion,

114
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:37,983
so let's change it up a bit.

115
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,400
Do you have an idea of what
we should make first?

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,900
Yeah, for the first step
on our giant roadmap,

117
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,817
we're gonna need to
make something invaluable.

118
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,317
[SENKU]
A cotton candy machine.

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,108
Cot...

120
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:52,900
...ton...

121
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:53,817
...can...

122
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,192
...dy?

123
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:59,192
[GEN]
Hm. Perhaps I spoke too soon.

124
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,192
Because the IQ level
just plummeted like,

125
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,650
a hundred points.

126
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,692
Is Senku okay?

127
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,608
So what now?

128
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,817
They're working.
Making something.

129
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,358
A weapon?

130
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,650
[yells]

131
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,108
What is that?

132
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:38,692
[chuckles]

133
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:42,317
You put sugar crystals inside of
this thing and spin it around.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,650
The centrifugal force
pushes the molten sugar

135
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,400
out through the small holes,

136
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,817
which give us thin,
wispy strands.

137
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,900
And that is how you
make cotton candy.

138
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,733
Now tell me, what do
you think would happen

139
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,483
if you were to use gold
instead of sugar in there?

140
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,483
Huh? Huh? Huh?

141
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,108
Ah! We'd be making gold threads!

142
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,275
[SENKU chuckles]

143
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,275
You get ten billion
points for that one.

144
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,983
Ah. So we're making
wires for electronics.

145
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,608
The IQ was dropping,

146
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,650
but it seems that it's
finally going back up.

147
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,192
[CHROME]
All right!

148
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,858
I'll grab some
of our gold then!

149
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,692
Whoa, gold is too precious!

150
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,442
We can't mess it up.

151
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:21,483
So, cotton candy.
That's the way to go.

152
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,817
We need to test it out first.

153
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:26,358
Ooh?

154
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,817
Yeah, good point.

155
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,900
We're gonna taste--I mean, uh,
we'll definitely test it out.

156
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,608
This "Homura" person
who started the fire

157
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,650
put us in a really bad spot.

158
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,858
We lost a lot of potato
wine and mirin

159
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:46,067
that was just about ready to go.

00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,942
Kohaku's shield is super
handy for this task!

317
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,692
It's like ten billion percent
the perfect size and shape

318
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,317
for the gear we need right now!

319
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,358
[KOKUYO gasps]

320
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,567
You're really gonna
use her shield?

321
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,192
The same one that
the chief was given

322
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,733
when he won the Grand Bout?

323
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,733
The one he handed down
to his daughter?

324
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,525
The one he handed down
to his daughter?

325
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:14,775
The one he handed down
to his daughter?

326
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,983
[VILLAGER C]
Grand Bout victor: Kokuyo!

327
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,567
[KOKUYO laughs]

328
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,608
[VILLAGER D]
Congrats!

329
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,442
[VILLAGER B]
Yay!

330
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,400
Wow, it's so pretty!

331
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,983
Aww. If it makes you happy,
you can have it!

332
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,692
[giggles] Thank you
so much, Daddy!

333
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,108
Daddy! Daddy!

334
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,608
Oh, uh, I don't really mind,

335
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:37,275
but ya know... it means
so much to Kohaku.

336
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,525
It was a gift
from her daddy.

337
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,233
So she probably doesn't
wanna part with it.

338
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,233
No, it's not a big deal to me.

339
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,900
Huh?!

340
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,692
[KOHAKU]
Practicality first.

341
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,942
[CHROME]
Damn, that's savage!

342
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,942
[GINRO]
Whoa! This is amazing!

343
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,442
It's easy because I only have
to turn it in one direction,

344
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,192
and the speed doesn't
matter at all!

345
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:06,608
I feel like I could keep doing
this forever without any help.

346
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,483
[BOTH chuckle]

347
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,192
It can move slowly...

348
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:17,442
Go forever in the
same direction...

349
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:20,775
It spins and pushes...

350
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Badass! I got an idea!

351
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,275
Ah, you are gonna love it!

352
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,692
[KASEKI]
What's gotten into you?

353
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,775
[CHROME]
Just hear me out!

354
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,858
[CHROME whispering]

355
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,775
[KASEKI yells]

356
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,442
All right! Let's haul ass!

357
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:42,983
[GROUP groaning]

358
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,442
That's weird.

359
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,567
I wonder what Chrome
could be up to now.

360
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,567
He's just got some kinda
scheme he's cookin' up.

361
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,775
Let him be.

362
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,608
When a guy's getting
into mischief like that,

363
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,483
you're not really supposed
to look until he's done.

364
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,983
[chuckles]

365
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,608
We don't really have the time
to be worrying about him.

366
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:00,983
Because you're
all about to begin

367
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:04,525
some hellishly grueling
manual labor.

368
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,442
We're gonna twist these
gold threads together

369
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,150
into a super thin wire
that we'll work into a coil.

370
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,983
And how long do you think this
coil is gonna need to be?

371
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,692
Good question.

372
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,317
I'd say it's from around here...
to the top of that mountain!

373
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,733
[OTHERS scream]

374
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:23,192
Once again we're going to
need tremendous manpower.

375
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,358
But lucky for you, you're now
the village chief, huh?

376
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,608
You're calling the shots.

377
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,192
[SENKU]
Uh?

378
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:18,650
Well, it's finally
completed, Senku.

379
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:23,400
We both worked...
for three days.

380
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,483
No sleep.

381
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,858
[gasps]

382
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:33,025
Whoa. What is that?

383
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,317
[KASEKI]
Ha-ha! I know I'm awesome,

384
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,233
but this blade of science
is really something special!

385
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,983
It would've never
worked without this:

386
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,192
My super iron cutting tool.

387
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:48,608
Pretty great, eh?

388
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:52,525
So what do you think?
Isn't my new invention amazing?

389
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:56,608
This is payback for when you
got me good with that magnet!

390
00:20:56,692 --> 00:21:00,192
You realize we want you
to be more shocked.

391
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,358
A waterwheel.

392
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:04,025
Man, of course you already
know what it is!

393
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,733
Water... wheel?

394
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,358
But I had a great name
for this contraption!

395
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,983
"Forever Spinny
Cotton Candy Machine"!

396
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,192
Waterwheel is much better.

397
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:16,525
Now, don't think I'm not
shocked by it, Chrome.

398
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,442
I honestly can't believe
you built this thing

399
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,192
without even knowing what it is.

400
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,483
[BOTH]
Hm?

401
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:24,650
[BOTH chuckle]

402
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,275
[SENKU] Listen, you guys,
this is a way bigger deal

403
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,858
than an automatic
cotton candy machine.

404
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,775
There's something else that's
gonna be a whole lot easier.

405
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,608
Remember that generator
Kinro and Ginro

406
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:39,025
had to work so hard to spin?

407
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,608
Oh, yeah! Right!

408
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,192
Now that we have gears
and a waterwheel,

409
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:55,608
the age of manual labor
has officially ended.

410
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:02,067
[SENKU] With an infinite machine
that requires no fuel...

411
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,108
...we're finally
truly harnessing

412
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,025
the incredible power of nature.

413
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:13,150
[ALL gasp]

414
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,983
[SENKU] Say goodbye
to relying on manpower

415
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,650
and hello to the age of energy!
