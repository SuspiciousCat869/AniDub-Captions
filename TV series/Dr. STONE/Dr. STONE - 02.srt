1
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:10,983
[TAIJU]
Yuzuriha!

2
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,775
Sorry I'm late!

3
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:15,275
It's fine.

4
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,942
So what's going on, Taiju?
You wanted to talk to me?

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,150
[giggles]

6
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,775
[TAIJU] All this time,
I've been so scared

7
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:23,025
that if I tell her how
I really feel about her,

8
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,233
she could not want to
be my friend anymore.

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,483
[TAIJU]
It's like this, Yuzuriha.

10
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,942
[TAIJU]
All right. No turning back now!

11
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:33,150
[TAIJU] I've kept this inside
me for five years, and--

12
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,275
[gasps]

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,192
[TAIJU] Hold up,
what's that weird light?

14
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,567
[NARRATOR]
On that day,

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,608
every man, woman,
and child on Earth

16
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,108
instantly turned to stone.

17
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,108
[SENKU chuckles]

18
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,442
[SENKU]
Well, look who's finally awake.

19
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,317
Good morning, ya big oaf.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,817
[chuckles]

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,108
It's October 5th
in the year 5738.

22
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,233
It has been 3,700 years.

23
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:06,108
[gasps]

24
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,942
How do you know what day it is?

25
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,983
You got some kinda
calendar, or what?

26
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,942
Huh? I figured it
out by counting.

27
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,192
It was the logical thing to do.

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,358
It took humanity over
two million years

29
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:20,442
to crawl out of the stone
age to the modern age.

30
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:23,067
We need to do that in a sprint.

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,442
I swear, I'm going to
take back the world.

32
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,817
Through science, I'll figure
out what happened to us,

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,067
and how we broke free.

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,775
I swear on my life,
I'll save you!

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,733
[TAIJU gasps]

36
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:43,775
I'm gonna beat fantasy with
science as my only weapon.

37
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:46,900
Oh, hell yeah. Get excited.

38
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,317
What do you think, man?

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Who are we gonna
bring back first?

40
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:51,733
[SENKU]
Hmm.

41
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, we're gonna revive
everybody sooner or later,

42
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:57,067
so it doesn't matter all that
much who we start with.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,567
[SENKU chuckles]

44
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,067
[SENKU]
Although I suppose it would suck

45
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,858
if we happened to wake
up a murderer first.

46
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,192
I get ya.

47
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,108
[SENKU] I don't particularly
feel like choosing

48
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,608
who we revive first.

49
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:15,233
So, Taiju. It's all
on you, my friend.

50
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,317
[TAIJU gasps]

51
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,108
I appreciate that, pal.

52
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:23,442
I know who I'll pick.
I mean, it's obvious.

53
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,775
[TAIJU]
All right, I'm ready.

54
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,442
It's go time!

55
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:06,900
Let's pour that miracle water!

56
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,900
It's gonna turn her back
to normal again, right?

57
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,400
Yeah. I believe that it will.

58
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,942
I tried it on a piece
of broken stone

59
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,275
and it turned into
a hunk of dead flesh.

60
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,983
Try and have a little respect
for the dead, would ya?!

61
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,233
I did make the effort

62
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,692
to put them back together
first, obviously.

63
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,525
But it seems that once
someone has died,

64
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,525
reviving them is not an option.

65
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,983
I value their sacrifice.

66
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,483
Perhaps you should
pray for them.

67
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,067
[TAIJU]
Uh, right!

68
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,775
Rest in peace, rest in peace,
rest in peace, rest in peace...

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,650
[TAIJU]
I'm sorry, Yuzuriha.

70
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,108
I didn't mean to keep you
waiting for thousands of years.

71
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:44,775
But now, I'm gonna
bring you back to life.

72
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,692
Hold on, Senku! She's naked!

73
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,942
Don't look at her!

74
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,650
[TAIJU] We gotta wait!
We can't wake her up like this!

75
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,150
I know it's tough,

76
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,358
but would it kill you to try
to use some logic for once?

77
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:03,025
I think the Stone World's
kind of a special situation.

78
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,025
There's absolutely nobody
around to give a damn

79
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,358
if your butt's showing,

80
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,608
or even if your
dick's hanging out.

81
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,525
Yuzuriha does not have a dick!

82
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:13,233
You're missing the
point, you idiot!

83
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,608
We need to take her back to camp

84
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,233
and get some clothes
on her first.

85
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,983
Okay. But how heavy's
that statue, anyway?

86
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,442
You'd better not
be calling her fat!

87
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,317
Way to completely miss
the point again.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,233
What I mean, is wouldn't it
be like ten billion times

89
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,733
more efficient to
just wake her up

90
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,733
and have her walk there with us?

91
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:33,608
I can't deal with all
this illogical thinking.

92
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,108
[snarling]

93
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,108
Hey, wait, you big oaf!

94
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,275
[TAIJU]
Huh?

95
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,858
[growls]

96
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,817
Why is there a lion
walking around Japan?!

97
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,192
Why do you think?!

98
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,733
It's gotta be descended from
a zoo animal, obviously!

99
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:56,858
The door must've been open

100
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:58,983
when the zookeeper
was turned to stone.

101
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,400
And without humans
to contain them,

102
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,692
all the herbivores
were likely on the menu!

103
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,025
Plus, once they got
out into the city,

104
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm sure it was a pet buffet!

105
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:09,025
So that means, they're
literally the king of beasts!

106
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:13,067
The Stone World is brutal, and
we can't let ourselves forget:

107
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,275
Humans aren't at the top
of the food chain anymore!

108
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,108
[BOTH yell]

109
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,567
[roaring]

110
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,233
[TAIJU] Why haven't the lions
actually attacked us, yet?

111
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,567
[SENKU chuckles]

112
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,192
[SENKU] They've probably
never seen bipeds before.

113
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:42,025
I bet we look creepy as hell
to them, running on two legs.

114
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,733
[TAIJU] Yeah, we are the
only humans in the world.

115
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,525
[SENKU]
We definitely spooked 'em.

116
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,650
But they'll go in
for the kill soon.

117
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,650
Even if we get super lucky and
make it back to camp in time,

118
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,900
all we've got to fight
them with are spears.

119
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:58,442
Unfortunately, this was "game
over" from the very beginning.

120
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,608
[TAIJU yells]

121
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,650
[yelps]

122
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,358
You dying now is not
an option, Senku!

123
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:13,442
Your big, science-filled brain
is humanity's last hope!

124
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,608
Even if I gotta be lion
food, I'll save ya!

125
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,983
No way!

126
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,733
Use some logic for once, Taiju!

127
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,317
I'm the brains, and obviously
you're the brawn!

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,650
If humanity is gonna live on,
we both need to as well!

129
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,525
If we're gonna
make a run for it,

130
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,275
it's imperative
we do it together!

131
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:37,525
Yeah! I got it!

132
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:40,608
[SENKU] Besides, I know you've
never actually even hit anyone.

133
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,900
That's been true ever
since we were little.

134
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,150
[SENKU] You may be an athlete,
and strong as an ox,

135
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,358
but you're not a fighter!

136
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,192
[TAIJU]
Hey, if we can't outrun them,

137
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,400
I thought of something
we can do instead!

138
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,567
I found this guy earlier.

139
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,192
He was called "the strongest
primate high-schooler."

140
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,192
Shishio Tsukasa.

141
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,025
[TAIJU]
Sorry about this,

142
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:10,525
but right now, we need somebody
who can fight to help us.

143
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:13,025
If we can make our way
through this in one piece,

144
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,358
I promise, we'll
wake you up real--

145
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:17,150
Don't waste your breath,
let's just pour it on him.

Crap! We're surrounded!

00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,692
This is it!

[TAIJU]
Sorry!

152
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:44,775
I know this isn't what
you wanna wake up to

153
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,858
after sleeping a
few thousand years.

154
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,900
[TSUKASA]
What's the situation?

155
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,692
[SENKU] Your whole body
is covered in stone.

156
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:58,067
There're lions from your
nine o'clock to your two.

157
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,108
Yeah, okay.

158
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,067
[SENKU gasps]

159
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,608
[TSUKASA] You can fill me in
on all the details later,

160
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:42,733
but I owe you.

161
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:45,525
So I'll make you this promise.

162
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,150
As long as we're together,

163
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,275
the two of you will not
be in danger again.

164
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,067
From now on, I'll take
care of all the fighting.

165
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,608
[TAIJU]
Yeah!

166
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,400
You hear that, Senku?

167
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,650
We had brains and brawn,

168
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,775
but now we've also got
brute force on the team!

169
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,733
We're just like the
three musketeers!

170
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,400
[chuckles]

171
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,275
I suppose we are,

172
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,192
but I have a nagging
feeling that the new guy

173
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,192
may be a little bit too strong.

174
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,192
How could that be a bad thing?

175
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:17,400
Like, don't we need
that kinda help?

176
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,150
What if it turns out
that he's actually

177
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,525
some evil, homicidal,
sex-crazed, wannabe tyrant?

178
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,733
Dude's so overpowered,

179
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:26,442
he just killed a lion
with his bare hands.

180
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,358
In a world where guns
haven't been invented,

181
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:31,775
he's ten billion
percent unstoppable.

182
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:32,650
[YUZURIHA]
Wow!

183
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,275
Come to the "primate," Yuzuriha.

184
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:39,775
Oh, no way! We can't
let that happen.

185
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:41,442
[TSUKASA]
Hey, guys.

186
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,858
You have anything I could
use to butcher this with?

187
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,025
A knife, or at least
something sharp

188
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,025
if that's all we've got.

189
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,192
Are you thinking about
eating that thing?

190
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,275
That's nasty!

191
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,733
[SENKU chuckles]

192
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,733
Well, it's not poisonous,

193
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:58,025
but it's super tough
and reeks of ammonia.

194
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,567
Not to mention it tastes bad.

195
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,067
When the hell did you eat lion?!

196
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,900
When I was in Africa
doing research on Ebola.

197
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,567
What kind of high-
school kid are you?!

198
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,900
[TSUKASA]
Although it was attacking us,

199
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,608
I took this noble
creature's life.

200
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:17,025
So... I wanna give back
to the circle of life

201
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,942
by putting all of it to use.

202
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,983
I owe it that much.

203
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,275
[yells]

204
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,192
That's so cool!

205
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,733
How 'bout that, Senku?

206
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,733
We just woke up a
legendary warrior

207
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:33,108
and he's like, actually
a solid dude, too!

208
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,775
[SENKU]
I hope you're right.

209
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,275
Well, the whole
"circle of life" thing

210
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,108
doesn't move me one millimeter.

211
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,692
But I have to agree about not
wasting meat or resources.

212
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:05,483
[TSUKASA] Interesting.
The two of you built this?

213
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,733
[SENKU]
Sure did.

214
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,483
Just hang in there a
little while longer, okay?

215
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,275
But I promise, we'll
get you fixed up.

216
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,483
We just need miracle water.

217
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,650
[TSUKASA]
Huh.

218
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,608
You've got a laboratory?

219
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:28,192
[TSUKASA]
Anyway, I'm Shishio Tsukasa.

220
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,192
Just call me Tsukasa.

221
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:33,442
I suppose family names don't
really mean much in this world.

222
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:37,442
I'm Senku, the brainy one behind
our scientific advancements.

223
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,233
Taiju, the simple one,
handles all of the grunt work.

224
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,150
I'm Taiju, the simple one.

225
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:46,775
It's true. Senku does do most
of the thinking around here.

226
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:48,983
What have you been surviving on?

227
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,317
[SENKU] Mostly wild
greens and mushrooms.

228
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,983
And once in a while,
we'll bag a rabbit for meat.

229
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,817
[TAIJU] Oh, man, lately
I've been dreaming about

230
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,150
eating so much meat
my belly explodes.

231
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,317
[TAIJU laughs]

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,608
[TSUKASA] Well, you two
won't have to survive

233
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,775
on just that anymore.

234
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,483
I'm here now.

235
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,900
[TSUKASA] I'll take on all
the fighting and the hunting.

236
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:45,233
Oh, wow! This is awesome!

237
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,567
Now that you guys
have me on your side,

238
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,775
you won't have to just dream
about filling your bellies.

239
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:56,858
[TAIJU]
Ah, I get it.

240
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,692
So if we just go ahead
and cook the food,

241
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,608
we won't need a
fridge to keep it in.

242
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,775
I'm not cooking these fish.

243
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,483
I'm using the aldehydes in
the smoke to kill the microbes.

244
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,025
In words that your feeble
brain can understand,

245
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,692
I'm smoking them.

246
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,150
With me and Senku
working together,

247
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,817
we should have plenty
of preserved food.

248
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,067
We can take the first step
towards civilization now.

249
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,608
So we're still on step zero?

250
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,650
[TAIJU]
Huh?

251
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,650
Hey, Tsukasa, what's wrong?

252
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:32,525
[yelling]

253
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,942
[BOTH gasp]

254
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:43,067
[TAIJU gasps]

255
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,775
Sorry if I startled you.

256
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,817
[TSUKASA] Just noticed this
person buried under that rock.

257
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,317
I said he was a solid
dude, didn't I?

258
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,733
[chuckles]

259
00:14:56,817 --> 00:15:00,067
It's like having a superhero
on our team, huh?

260
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,275
[TAIJU groans]

261
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:08,025
My belly's so full!

262
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,692
Okay. It's time to take
a fun little pop quiz.

263
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,858
For a technological
civilization,

264
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,942
what's the most important
component to have?

265
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,858
Right answer will get
you ten billion points.

266
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:24,400
Well, it's gotta be...
something that's techy,

267
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:27,192
but what exactly?

268
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:28,358
Smartphones!

269
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,900
Oh, sure! Yeah!

270
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,275
Smartphones would be
great, wouldn't they?

271
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:35,775
We're not jumping ten billion
years into the future, dummy!

272
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,775
Maybe... iron?

273
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,525
Iron's pretty important,
but not at this stage.

274
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,942
There's something
far more crucial.

275
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,108
It's calcium carbonate.

276
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,400
[TAIJU]
Of course!

277
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,275
Once again, I have no idea
what you're saying!

278
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:50,525
[TSUKASA]
Do you mean lime?

279
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,817
[SENKU] Yep, let me
think of way to put it

280
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,317
that even someone like
Taiju could understand.

281
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,650
It's the stuff they use
to mark athletic fields.

282
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,483
Cool! So we're gonna have
to find a gym storage locker

283
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,858
and grab some whatever-
that-was carbonate?

284
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:07,025
Oh, sure! Yeah!
Let's just head to the gym!

285
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:08,983
Don't be such an idiot!

286
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,442
You think we'll find one
after 3,700 years?

287
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:17,858
[SENKU]
C'mon, Taiju, think.

288
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:19,275
You know those shells
that you've been using

289
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,650
to shave your big, oafish face?

290
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,483
If we pulverize them
into a powder,

291
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,358
we'll have plenty of calcium
carbonate in no time.

292
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,900
Yeah!

293
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:33,733
Looks like I'm needed for
some serious brawn duty!

294
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,983
[yelling]

295
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:44,692
[SENKU] Calcium carbonate
actually gets me excited.

296
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,150
Check it out!

297
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,900
There are four super useful
things you can do with it.

298
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:51,108
First is agriculture.

299
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:54,358
We can use it to blow away
the hydrogen ions in the soil,

300
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,108
and that'll be a major
upgrade for the farmland.

301
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,442
Second is construction.

302
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,692
Heat it up and mix it with
sand and you have mortar.

303
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,192
[TAIJU coughing]

304
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,650
[SENKU] Mortar's like a
less sophisticated cement.

305
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,358
We can use it to build
houses and furnaces.

306
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,567
Third is hygiene.

307
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,733
Gather calcium carbonate from
seaweed and blend it with oil

308
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,775
and the reaction makes soap.

309
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,192
[SENKU]
This world is brutal,

310
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,275
and getting sick
means game over.

311
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,942
But a little chunk that
gets rid of harmful germs

312
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,942
is a lifesaver in a
world without doctors.

313
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,400
You can call it "Doctor Stone."

314
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:33,108
[TSUKASA]
I gotta hand it to you, Senku.

315
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:34,275
You're pretty amazing.

316
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,942
[SENKU]
Hm?

317
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,942
I mean, you freed me
during a lion attack,

318
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,942
but you stayed calm
and spoke clearly.

319
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,692
I've never met anyone
like you before.

320
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:47,275
You truly have my respect.

321
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,858
For at least the last
ten billion years or so,

322
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,108
almost without exception,

323
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,983
a man who praises
another to his face

324
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,192
is either flirting or scheming.

325
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,817
[SENKU]
So what are you getting at?

326
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:09,317
It's not like that. I'm really
not doing either one of those.

327
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,525
I was just thinking,
if there's anybody

328
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:14,025
who could rebuild modern
civilization from scratch,

329
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,525
it's you.

330
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,692
Yeah. That's all I
was trying to say.

331
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,192
[TAIJU grunts]

332
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,942
So this is the kinda
stuff you gotta do

333
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:27,942
to build a civilization, huh?

334
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,525
That's right.
One step at a time.

335
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,817
The journey is a slow one,
that's for sure.

336
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,817
But we keep on getting closer.

337
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,358
Hey, so what was
that fourth thing?

338
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,817
You said there were four
uses for the seashells,

339
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,233
but you only told
us about three.

340
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,775
No, there're only three.

341
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,108
I said three earlier, didn't I?

342
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,942
[TAIJU]
Oh. Did you?

343
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,858
Man, my memory is
all screwed up.

344
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:56,400
[TAIJU laughing]

345
00:18:56,483 --> 00:19:01,442
[snoring]

346
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,192
[TAIJU coughs]

347
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,733
[TAIJU]
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!

348
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:22,025
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!
Shells! Shells! Shells!

349
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,608
[TSUKASA] We have so much
freedom in this Stone World.

350
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,608
Nobody is around to
claim that shells

351
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,692
are their personal property.

352
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:40,150
Or the ocean. Or the land.

353
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:45,983
[TSUKASA] A long time ago,
there was a poor boy

354
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,358
whose little sister was
going through surgery.

355
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:52,192
He collected seashells to
make a necklace for her

356
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,400
and help her feel better.

357
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:59,067
His sister loved
the Little Mermaid.

358
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,525
But along came an older man

359
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:04,067
who owned the fishing rights
to that part of the beach.

360
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,525
He reeked of booze.

361
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:14,817
[TSUKASA] The boy thought he was
collecting shells, but the man,

362
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,483
the man accused him
of stealing the shells,

363
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:22,525
and beat him so badly,
he was almost unrecognizable,

364
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,150
He was never able
to make his sister

365
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,275
feel like the Little Mermaid.

366
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:44,233
You do know what you
just did, don't you?

367
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,900
That may have looked
like a statue,

368
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,858
but we both know you
just killed a man.

369
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,900
[TSUKASA]
Of course I know.

370
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,067
Tell me something, Senku.

371
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,108
Are you planning to bring back

372
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,900
all the greedy,
black-hearted adults

373
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:59,358
who ruined the world
we came from?

374
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:01,983
Sure, they'll be overly
grateful to you

375
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,233
right after you help them out

376
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:06,442
but as soon as
civilization returns,

377
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:08,525
the rich and powerful
will say things like,

378
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,983
"This used to be my property,

379
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,692
so you'd better start
paying me rent."

380
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,900
Next, they'll try
to collect taxes.

381
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,025
They'll rob the
young people like us

382
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,358
of our future all over again.

383
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,858
We simply can't bring
that kind of world back.

384
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,942
We live in the Stone World now.

385
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,192
A paradise that hasn't
been ruined by greed.

386
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:35,400
I think we should only revive
the young and pure-hearted,

387
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:37,525
and make sure that we
keep this world natural

388
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,692
and not owned by anyone.

389
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:44,108
This is our chance
to purify humanity.

390
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:47,567
Don't you agree with me, Senku?

391
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:01,483
No, I don't. That speech didn't
move me one millimeter.

392
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,775
I'm the kinda guy who
absolutely loves technology.

393
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,817
I get excited by space and mechs

394
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,358
and Doraemon
and stuff like that.

395
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:13,192
I'm going use the
awesome power of science

396
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:16,025
to rescue every last person.
