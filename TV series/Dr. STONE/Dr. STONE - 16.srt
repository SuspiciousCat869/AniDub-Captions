[KOKUYO]
Everyone!

2
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:13,775
As of now, this man
known as Senku

3
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,983
is pronounced the new
chief of Ishigami Village!

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,233
[VILLAGERS cheering]

5
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:21,442
[SENKU]
Ishigami Village?

6
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:24,983
[RURI]
That's right Senku.

7
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:29,942
I know of you. I have
for a long, long time.

8
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:33,150
Since I was a child.

9
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:38,275
Your full name...
is Ishigami Senku.

10
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:43,858
[SENKU]
Thanks.

11
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:46,608
Everything is finally starting
to make sense to me.

12
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,650
If every last living
person on the planet

13
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,233
was turned into stone,

14
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,317
then who could've even founded
this village in the first place?

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,025
Also, why do you, Kohaku,

16
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:58,733
and some of the others clearly
have foreign blood in you?

17
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:01,525
Now, all thanks to you, those
mysteries have been solved.

18
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,525
[BOTH gasp]

19
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,442
Sorry, but no?

20
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,067
I don't see how any mysteries
have been solved.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,733
Yeah, and I don't get how
Senku happens to have

22
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:12,650
the same name
as the village.

23
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,275
Plus, Ruri, you somehow
knew about Senku?

24
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,025
[SENKU chuckles]

25
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:18,483
I'll bet that I probably come up

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:22,275
in your priestess
mythology, don't I?

27
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:24,150
You do.

28
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:26,067
When you say "mythology,"

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,442
do you mean like Momotaro
and the gorilla?

30
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:29,608
[SENKU]
Yeah.

31
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:31,483
No wonder you guys
know about folk tales

32
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,983
and giant animals you would
never have seen before.

33
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:37,650
Yeah. Ruri taught us
about lots of stuff.

34
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:39,358
The priestess passes
down knowledge

35
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:41,858
to the next generation
through stories

36
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,067
known as the Hundred Tales.

37
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:47,525
[RURI'S MOTHER]
Ruri.

38
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,567
This last story, the Hundredth
Tale, is very important.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,567
And this one is true.

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,567
It happened a long,
long time ago.

41
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,150
[RURI]
The story my mother told me

42
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:05,733
is one of great strength,
and an indomitable spirit.

43
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,692
The Hundredth Tale.

44
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,525
I'll tell it now.

45
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,192

Its title is...

46
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,775
[RURI]
..."Ishigami Senku."

47
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,650
Why in the heck do you keep
following me, Moon? What gives?

48
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:16,733
[SENKU whistling]

49
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,192
[SENKU]
Even if I juke it hard,

50
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,233
it follows me ten billion
percent of the time.

51
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:24,817
[SENKU growls]

52
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,650
[RURI, BYAKUYA] Ever since he
was very young, this boy, Senku,

53
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,900
was fascinated by
the world's mysteries.

54
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,400
[BYAKUYA laughs]

55
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,608
[BYAKUYA]
I know!

56
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,733
It's because it has
a crush on you, Senku.

[groans]

58

I don't need that kinda
crap right now.

59
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,858
I wanna know about all
the science behind it.

preschooler are you?

[BYAKUYA
]The real reason the Moon

62
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,192
looks like it's following you
is 'cause it's super far away.

63
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,608
And because I choked hard
on a crucial portion

64
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,692
of the astronaut
selection trials.

65
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,775
It seems even farther
away from your old man.

66
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,942
I don't need to hear about

67
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,692
your little pity party
right now either.

68
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,108
[BYAKUYA]
I got a killer leg cramp

69
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:10,608
in the middle of the
clothed swimming test.

70
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,900
I was never a good
swimmer to begin with,

71
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:15,358
but that one still stings.

72
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,358
[SENKU] Do you know when they'll
be recruiting astronauts again?

73
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,983
Not soon.

74
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,900
It's something like
once per decade.

75
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,150
[SENKU]
I'm going to space.

76
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,733
So an astronaut then?

77
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,900
That's an excellent
dream, young man.

78
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,317
Work hard, and when
you grown up, you--

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
No. I'm going there
as soon as possible.

80
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,067
[BYAKUYA] Senku loves
space as much as I do,

81
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,108
but he always
thinks for himself,

82
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,442
and builds things for himself.

83
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:47,233

hook, line, and sinker.

was your biggest

You're saying a fifth grader

00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,025
So did it prove useful to you?

00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,608
put in that much time and effort
because he wanted to help.

117
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,608
I had no choice but to swim
in it, even if it killed me.

118

And it turns out, in the end,

119
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,692
I made it through
the swimming test,

120

and consequently,
on to this interview.

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,150
Whew, I'm flying!

317
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,817
Zero gravity!

318
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,983
I'm free!

319
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,400
[BYAKUYA laughs]

320
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,775
[BYAKUYA]
Can't get away from me!

321
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:17,317
You sure are having fun, huh?

322
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
[BYAKUYA]
Yo.

323
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:23,025
Do ya wanna try
some Japanese food?

324
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,483
No, this nutrient jelly
is enough for me.

325
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,192
For every meal?

326
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,650
Ugh. Sounds boring.

327
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:34,733
Here.

328
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,525
So, are those noodles?

329
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:42,650
[BYAKUYA] Not just noodles,
it's custom-made ramen.

330
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,400
Tastes exactly like
the ramen at the place

331
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,733
my son and I go to all the time.

332
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:50,275
I have no doubt it's
very delicious, Byakuya.

333
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:51,608
but it's too much.

334
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:55,608
We've come here to work,
and our time is precious.

335
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:58,733
Sorry, fun's not crucial
to human survival.

336
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:03,483
Come on, man, just have
a taste. It'll shock ya!

337
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,483
[sighs]

338
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,067
[BYAKUYA]
Mh-hm?

339
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,608
[BYAKUYA chuckles]

340
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:17,692
[gasps]

341
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,983
[BYAKUYA]
See? It's scary good!

342
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,733
[LILLIAN]
Ooh! I wanna try some, too!

343
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,817
[SHAMIL]
No.

344
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,858
Look there. Outside the window.

345
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,650
The Earth.

346
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
[gasps]

347
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:41,775
[BYAKUYA]
Senku.

348
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,025
[gasps]

349
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,567
[inaudbile]

350
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,067
[SHAMIL]
What's happening?

351
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,608
NASA, Roscosmos--
I can't reach either one.

352
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,608
The comms out?

353
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:21,483
No, there's no one responding.

354
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,983
Um, ham radio's the same.
All lines are silent.

355
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,358
That light...

356
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,067
Something happened down there.

357
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,775
Something terrible!

358
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,775
[CONNIE]
What? Like a nuclear war?

359
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,442
You shouldn't say
such foolish things!

360
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,400
Yes! The Internet still works.

361
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:43,067
Anyone tweetin' about
what's goin' on?

362
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:52,358
Nothing. Everybody stopped
posting at the same time.

363
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:54,442
I know! Live camera feeds!

364
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,650
Huh?

365
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,025
Bingo!

366
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,525
[BYAKUYA gasps]

367
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:06,358
[BYAKUYA] What the hell?
Are those statues?

368
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,525
But how's that possible?

369
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,900
No, there's more.

370
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,442
[gasps]

371
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,233
[CONNIE]
Oh my God.

372
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,400
[YAKOV]
We can't act rashly!

373
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:30,692
Let's wait here.

374
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,483
There are seven billion
humans on the planet,

375
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,775
so let's wait for the
survivors to contact us.

376
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:37,442
They'll be able to help us!

377
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,192
So how long should we wait?

378
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,942
For a month? Maybe two?

379
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:45,733
With humanity in this state,
we have no hope for a rescue.

380
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,233
We're floating in
space, remember?

381
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:54,983
Well then, let's go back.

382
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,192
[ALL gasp]

383
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:59,192
Hold on. What are you
even talking about?

384
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:00,650
Did you hear what I said?

385
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,858
Out of all the people down
there, someone can help us!

386
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:06,525
[BYAKUYA]
You're wrong, Yakov.

387
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:08,442
There are only six.

388
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:12,275
We are the last humans left.

389
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:16,483
So we can't just sit here
and wait around for help.

390
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,358
Because now it's up to
us to help them out!

391
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:22,817
All the seven billion
people on Earth need us!
