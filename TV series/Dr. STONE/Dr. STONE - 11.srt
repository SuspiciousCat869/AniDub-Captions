Your strike's too shallow!

3
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,108
We're counting on those guys
to make Ruri's medicine,

4
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,150
but she'll never get it

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,650
unless one of us
wins the Grand Bout!

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,692
Okay, so while Gen is busy
smooth-talking ol' Tsukasa,

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,275
the science team needs to
start on our wonder drug.

8
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,567
Hell yeah! What's next
on our science journey?

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,608
Another fundamental component,

10
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:40,650
one as essential to
civilization as iron.

11
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:45,525
The first material in history
to be synthesized using science.

12
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:48,192
We call it glass.

13
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:50,858
[SUIKA]
Huh?

14
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,108
[CHROME]
What's that?

15
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,233
I mean, now that
we have electricity,

16
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,525
isn't the plan to start
making medicine?

17
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,358
[SENKU]
Yeah, it is.

18
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,900
But in order to do that,
we need glass first.

19
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:02,317
Those clay pots
aren't gonna cut it

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,942
for the kind of experiments
we'll be doing.

21
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,858
Glass can stand up to
just about any chemical.

22
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,442
In fact, we wouldn't even
have chemistry without it.

23
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,275
And it's ten billion
percent easy to process!

24
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,483
It can be fragile
or durable as hell.

25
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:17,858
You can even see through it,

26
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:20,692
which means you can observe
the reactions inside.

27
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:23,400
Seriously? That's bad!

28

[SENKU chuckles]

29
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,400
To top it off, once
glass is acquired,

30
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:30,233
we might finally get the chance
to yank off that melon,

31
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:32,733
take a look at Great
Detective Suika,

32
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:35,525
and finally see
that mysterious mug.

33
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:37,025
Yoink!

34
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:40,525
Stop, Senku! Suika doesn't
want anybody to see her face!

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,942
I don't understand why not.

36
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,275
[KOHAKU]
Ooh!

37
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:49,483
My gosh, Suika! You are just
the most adorable little thing!

38
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,150
[KOHAKU, CHROME]
What in the hell?!

39
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:30,608
[SUIKA] There's something
wrong with my eyes.

40
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,442
They've got the fuzzy sickness.

41
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,275
Everything looks fuzzy to me,

42
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:36,067
so when I try really
hard to see,

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,567
I end up looking like this,
and it's super embarrassing.

44
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,525
But when I put on
my watermelon mask,

45
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,025
it gets a little bit easier
to see for some reason!

46
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:49,608
Yeah, that's known as
the "pinhole effect."

47
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,067
If you look at an object
through a small hole,

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,525
the light passing
through it narrows

49
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,608
and brings it into focus.

50
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,442
So glass and the fuzzy sickness,
are they connected somehow?

51
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,858
Dude, they're like ten
billion percent connected!

52
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:07,900
Here's the deal, Suika.
You're nearsighted as hell.

53
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:12,983
It's not some kind of sickness.
There's nothing wrong with you.

54
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:17,400
In a technological civilization,
this isn't a big deal at all.

55
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:20,108
We have scientific eyes,
made outta glass.

56
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,525
They're called glasses,
and they help you see clearly.

57
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:29,983
[SUIKA] Science users can
actually make new eyes?

58
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,900
That's amazing.

59
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,483
It is.

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,525
[SUIKA]
If it's really possible,

61
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:41,442
I'd love to see all the
beauty in the world.

62
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,400
Even just once.

63
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:48,192
[SUIKA] I wanna see you guys
without the fuzziness.

64
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,358
I wanna see the real you.

65
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:54,942
Just one time would
be all I needed.

66
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,358
[CHROME]
All right. I'm ready to do this!

67
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,108
Let's make some of this glass!

68
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:03,358
[KOHAKU] Oh, yeah! What
materials do we need to gather?

69
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:06,608
[SENKU] Glass is mostly made
out of silica, or quartz sand.

70
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,150
Heh.

71
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,442
However, I didn't see any of
that in the Chrome Collection.

72
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,067
[CHROME] Why in the heck
would I be collecting sand?

73
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,108
Although, I did see a clue
that should lead us to some.

74
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,233
[CHROME]
This is the spot.

75
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,067
When I was a kid,
I found this cool,

76
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,858
see-through rock right here.

77
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,358
Well, that little
chunk is worth more

78
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:29,358
than you could
imagine right now.

79
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,025
That translucent rock
you've got in your hand

80
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,483
is a quartz crystal,

81
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,525
and it tends to be found in
areas of decayed granite.

82
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,317
[SENKU]
And in my hand,

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,067
I'm holding lots of the
raw material for glass:

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,983
Quartz sand.

85
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,567
[ALL gasp]

86
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,942
Whoa, bad.

87
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,233
Those tiny white grains
are falling out like crazy!

88
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,733
I didn't know this
would be so fun!

89
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,025
We're gonna get a bunch
of this stuff here!

90
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,567
Just try and gather as many of
the see-through ones as you can.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,025
[SENKU] We crush all
the quartz sand down

92
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:06,192
into even finer grains.

93
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,942
Then we mix it with a bunch
of other stuff and melt it.

94
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,483
[CHROME]
Do we need to get anything?

95
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,775
Actually, we've already gathered
everything we're gonna need.

96
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,358
Our hard work keeps paying off.

97
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:21,942
Ten percent calcium carbonate
from the sea shells,

98
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,317
then add 20% cooked seaweed.

99
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,983
[SENKU] All of the
same materials we used

100
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,817
back when we made soap.

101
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,733
Now that's done.

102
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,567
I can't believe
you've got galena!

103
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,692
Lead has been acquired!

104
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:45,067
[SENKU] We throw in a bit of
molten lead, and lo and behold,

105
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,650
we have super-transparent
crystal glass,

106
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,567
perfect for a lens.

[CHROME gasps]

108
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,442
It's all sparkly
and see-through,

109
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,025
kinda like a piece of ice!

110
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:56,692
Or some sorta gem.

[SUIKA] So what's that
weird tool thing do?

112
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,442
[SENKU]
It'll polish the glass,

[CHROME]
Ooh!

00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,317
I bet we can use that
super bad corundum stuff

I've got for polishing it up,
whaddaya think?

117
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,400
Glass has a Mohs hardness
rating of about a six.

118
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,358
Corundum's is nine,
so it's perfect!

Aw, yeah! It's gonna
work like a charm!

Kinro, you've got to

If you wanna fight with a spear,

133
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,983
you have to be able
to judge distance,

or you'll never beat Magma!

Judging distance. Right.

you obviously have
the fuzzy sickness.

It would be better if you

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,067
that means we can actually put
together a full chemistry set.

159
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,025
Calling it "labor
potential" is rude!

160
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,650
Way to ruin the moment, man!

161
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,900
[SENKU, SUIKA laugh]

162
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,150
[CHROME]
What's so funny?

163
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,817
What are you laughing about?

164
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,025
[SENKU chuckles]

165
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,692
Get excited to start our
primitive glass-making class!

166
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,483
Yeah! I'm ready to
do this, Senku!

167
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,942
We keep throwing in these
black rocks, right?

168
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:10,025
[SUIKA] I'm gonna to keep
these comin' for ya, guys!

169
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:13,442
Ah! Wow, Suika, you're like
a little speed demon.

170
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:14,983
How cool.

171
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:18,942
Now that everything's not fuzzy,
it makes things way easier.

172
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,942
Whoa, there are little white
bubbles comin' outta that stuff.

173
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,317
That's what we want.

174
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,275
When you heat obsidian like
this, it creates a foam.

175
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,567
[SENKU] Then, we'll use
that foam as insulation

176
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,400
and make a specialized
glassblowing furnace.

177
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:37,150
Next, we'll craft an iron straw,

178
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,192
use it to blow up the glass
with air, and that's it.

179
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,442
[SENKU chuckles]

180
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,067
[SENKU] Hey, that's fine.
This was our first try.

181
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,567
When I started making clay pots,

182
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,525
it took months before
they looked decent.

183
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:02,775
It's not fine!

184
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,108
We don't have months to
get it right this time!

185
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,775
Ruri's health doesn't
seem to be getting better.

186
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:09,983
I'm not some kinda
glass craftsman,

187
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,525
so I have to learn
by trial and error.

188
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,233
A craftsman?

189
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:29,608
I don't care for
this one bit, Chrome!

190
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,900
[SENKU]
Who the hell is that old fart?

191
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,150
Oh, come on, Old Man Kaseki!

192
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,400
We're in desperate need
of your crafting skills!

193
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,067
Now, is this really
how you youngins

194
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,650
ask for favors these days?

195
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,067
'Cause I'm not into this
kinky rope play stuff.

196
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,525
And I'm definitely not
interested in being a part

197
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,275
of whatever black arts
you're doing here.

198
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,983
See? And this is why I had
to do things the hard way.

199
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,483
Old Man Kaseki.

200
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,900
I forgot to bring your lacquer
back to you. I'm sorry.

201
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Ah, that had slipped my mind.

202
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,358
Tell me, were you the
one who made that?

203
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,650
Her lacquered shield is amazing.

204
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,442
And you crafted it
without iron tools

205
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,025
and hardly any dyes to speak of?

206
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,150
[KASEKI]
Yep!

207
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,442
That shield was a
prize from the year

208
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,150
that Kohaku's father, Kokuyo,

209
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,358
became the champion
of the Grand Bout.

210
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:21,567
I tell ya, I really did go all
out when I made that old beauty.

211
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,275
Gosh, that does take me back.

212
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:27,108
[KOHAKU giggling]

213
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,108
[SENKU]
The handiwork on that shield

214
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,233
is remarkable for this era.

215
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,858
So I had a feeling there must be
an expert craftsman behind it.

216
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,025
But I never expected you'd
be a dusty old fossil.

217
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:42,692
Did you make that awesome
suspension bridge, as well?

218
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,358
Yeah, I sure did.

219
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:46,733
And you had the nerve
to pull the planks out!

220
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,900
So you can count me out of
whatever bogus sorcery you--

221
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:51,400
[gasps]

222
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:54,108
Wait, what is this see-through
stonework you've got? Wow.

223
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,650
[SENKU, CHROME snickering]

224
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,358
[SENKU] We won't force you
to help if you don't want to.

225
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,900
So just sit back
and watch the show.

226
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,150
You should get a kick
outta this, Kaseki.

227
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:08,817
In fact, I bet you're gonna be
ten billion percent entertained.

228
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,525
So get ready to get excited!

229
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,108
[KASEKI]
Hmm.

230
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,233
It would seem that heat makes
the material pliable and soft.

231
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:18,025
It's like blubber.

232
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,608
[KASEKI]
The shape changes so easily!

233
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:26,733
Crap, blew it up too much again.

234
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:29,567
[KASEKI] What are you
doing you fool?! Stop!

235
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,733
[KASEKI] He's not spinning
it steadily at all.

236
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,025
At this rate, he's never going
to make a good vessel

237
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,567
or anything worth the effort.

238
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,400
Are they doing it this badly
on purpose just to piss me off?

239
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:52,483
Because that's definitely
what's happening.

240
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,692
[chuckles]

241
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,400
There's no way a guy
who spent his whole life

242
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:58,067
as a craftsman is gonna stand
there and watch a newbie

243
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,567
do something as drool-tastic
as glassblowing.

244
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,025
How much more of this can
you take, Old Man Kaseki?

245
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,400
This has gotta be getting
under your skin.

246
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,567
[growls] I can't
take it anymore!

247
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,900
[yells]

248
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:15,525
Boy! You got me
real good, damn it!

249
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,150
[BOTH]
Uh.

250
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,233
Let me take a crack at it!

251
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:20,650
[CHROME screaming]

252
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,275
He's jacked. Who'd've guessed?

253
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,692
Suika, water!

254
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,317
On it, sir!

255
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,442
Ah, man! That's nuts!

256
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:54,900
You'd never seen it before,

257
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,942
and you're like a
glass-making master!

258
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,525
[SENKU chuckles]

259
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,942
It's because he's got all those
years of crafting experience.

260
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,400
[laughs]

261
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:05,275
I've been a craftsman for
50 years, believe it or not.

262
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,400
In fact, son,
I'm kind of a big deal.

263
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:11,400
There are people like him
in every single era.

264
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,733
Dudes with true talent who've
spent their whole lives

265
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,400
with their heads down

266
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,275
and completely dedicated
to their work.

267
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,900
--Awesome!
--[SUIKA] Yay!

268
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,608
Oh, wow!

269
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,317
[CHROME] Come on, Senku, what's
the matter with you, man?

270
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,942
We finally have a killer lab!
I thought you'd get excited!

271
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,525
[SENKU]
Yeah, sure. Yippee.

272
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,817
At this point, we've reached
the dawn of chemistry.

273
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,775
Things are starting to get fancy
here in our neck of the woods.

274
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,483
Just look at all
the attractions.

275
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,150
It's gotta be ten billion times
more fun than Tsukasa Land.

276
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,900
Because the Kingdom
of Science rules!

277
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,400
Long time no see!
Mecha Senku, at your service!

278
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:32,567
Here to take you on a tour
of the Kingdom of Science!

279
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,025
This is the kingdom's home base.

280
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,692
It's a treasure
trove of minerals

281
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,608
Chrome's been collecting
since he was a kid.

282
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:43,025
Ha-ha! I've got tons
of awesome stuff!

283
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,858
[SENKU]
Our scientific gourmet dish:

284
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,817
Foxtail millet ramen!

285
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,817
Now this is somethin'
I can eat all day!

286
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,983
It's so yummy!

287
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,067
[SENKU]
We rely on strength in numbers

288
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,567
to make our iron supply!

289
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,233
Take it to 1,500 degrees!

290
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,317
This is such crazy-tough work.

291
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,692
I'll be up in a
second. Probably.

292
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,733
[SENKU] To beat Magma, we built
this hellish training arena.

293
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,067
Actually, it's just part
of the clearing.

294
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,233
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Friendship! Hard work! Victory!

295
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:28,442
You're just sleeping!

296
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,275
Get with the program!
Wake up! Let's go!

297
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,775
[KINRO, GINRO yelling]

298
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,942
[SENKU] We've got the
ultimate in green energy:

299
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,233
The elbow grease generator!

300
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:44,733
[yells]

301
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:47,983
[SENKU] Blowing glass with the
skill of an absolute master.

302
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,233
Shaping it just like clay.

303
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,108
[SENKU] The scorching
hot glass is cooled.

304
00:18:57,192 --> 00:19:00,025
Nice and slow, 'cause we
don't want it to crack.

305
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,317
[SENKU]
Our state of the art laboratory.

306
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,900
We're speeding through
the sulfa drug route

307
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:11,358
with all the bad chemicals
we can get our hands on!

308
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,317
Man, this is really
amazing, isn't it?

309
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,608
The Kingdom of Science is
starting to turn into something.

310
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,608
[SENKU chuckles]

311
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:29,650
We've only made the
bare essentials so far.

312
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,442
We wouldn't get anywhere
if we were missing

313
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,650
a single one of
these components.

314
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,650
So before the whole
world collapsed,

315
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,775
was the technology, like,
ridiculous or what?

316
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:44,150
Yeah. It took two million
years for us to get there.

317
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,483
And we're going to catch up
and run right past it.

318
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:52,233
[CHROME chuckles]

319
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,442
Our next step is
the sulfa drug.

320
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,150
We're gonna make
ourselves a cure-all.

321
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:03,900
[SUIKA]
Yay!

322
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:04,817
[KASEKI]
Yay!

323
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,983
--[SUIKA] Yay!
--[KASEKI] Yay!

324
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,525
--Yay! Yay!
--Yay! Yay!

325
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,567
Oh, man. Their team's so lucky.

326
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,358
It looks like fun.
They're playing.

327
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,192
They got shiny stuff.

328
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,192
[gasps]

329
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,983
Hey, Kinro, how's this idea?

330
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,942
What if the spear tip
was like, super shiny?

331
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,775
Don't you think that would
improve your training

332
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,525
since you could get a
better sense of distance

333
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,400
with your fuzzy vision.

334
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,983
What are you babbling about?
You're starting to annoy me.

335
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,692
Uh...

336
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,233
[laughs]

337
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,192
Oh, well, uh, if we're talkin'
'bout things that are shiny,

338
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,358
we need gold and silver spears!

339
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,442
That would be so freakin'
awesome, right?

340
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,983
I mean, strictly to use in
the Grand Bout, of course.

341
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,192
Those will definitely give us

342
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,650
just the edge we need
to win, won't they?

343
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,817
[BOTH grunt]

344
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:56,858
[SENKU]
Eh?

345
00:20:56,942 --> 00:21:00,108
[GINRO gasping]

346
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,317
I don't know anything
about fighting.

347
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,233
Is it true that a gold
and silver spear'll

348
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,650
help them beat Magma?

349
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,358
Or is that just crap?

350
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,317
Okay. I'll put it in a
way you'll understand.

351
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,192
They ten billion percent only
want gold and silver spears

352
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,067
because they think
that'll make 'em cool.

353
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,942
Oh, wow! Would you look at
all of this "glass," was it?

354
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,067
And this beautiful working area.

355
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,442
With this kinda stuff,

356
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,358
a silver spear must be
a snap to make!

357
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:28,358
And then takin' down Magma
would be easy-peasy!

358
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,650
[SENKU laughs]

359
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,483
Yeah, good point.

360
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,775
And now that we
have our glassware,

361
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:37,192
we're gonna have to suck it up
and go get the next ingredient.

362
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:41,275
Which is also the most
difficult material to obtain.

363
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:45,733
All right, let's break in
this lab with a silver spear.

364
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:46,858
But only a silver one.

365
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,483
--[KINRO grunts]
--[GINRO laughs]

366
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,150
Oh, I'm so sorry
about that, Kinro.

367
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:55,317
It's my way. I'm always
everyone's favorite.

368
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,275
[SENKU] You are in no way
my favorite, you clown.

369
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,233
This mission is quite risky.

370
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:03,150
It may well cost you
your life, Ginro.

371
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,567
Huh?

372
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,525
[SENKU] We're going to set
off on a grand adventure.

373
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:11,483
One where we'll discover
chemistry's greatest treasure.

374
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:15,442
So you'll be exploring an area
that's ridiculously dangerous.

375
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,650
Where you could literally
die in an instant.

376
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,067
Uh?
