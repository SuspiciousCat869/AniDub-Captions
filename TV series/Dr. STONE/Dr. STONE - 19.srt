00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:24,942
So what I heard is

00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,733
Tsukasa's been looking
for him the whole time.

00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:30,192
Yeah? Seriously?

00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,400
So who is this guy?

5
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,150
[TSUKASA]
Welcome, Hyoga.

6
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,317
You're now 3,700 years
into the future.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,108
In this brand new world,
your skills are needed.

8
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,275
And you will shine.

00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,692

gonna bring back

00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:01,692

12
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:05,442
but this guy looks like
a little toothpick!

00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,525
Yeah, how's this shrimpy
dude gonna help us anyway?

14
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,025
[GOONS laughing]

15
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:13,483
Fight him and you'll understand.

16
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,317
Why don't you go ahead and spar?

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,900
Ha-ha. Are you sure?
We might end up killin' him.

18
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,275
I feel kinda bad for
the wittle guy.

19
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,692
He may still be sleepy
after his long nap!

[GOONS laughing]

21
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,317
[HYOGA]
I don't mind.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Oh, yeah?

23
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,817
[HYOGA] If I'm allowed to
use my preferred weapon,

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,608
I'll gladly take on
ten men by myself.

25
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,358
Huh.

26
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:39,650

27

Well, it's too late for
you to back out now!

[GEN]
My, what impressive ills-skay.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,567
[TSUKASA]
Heh. I apologize.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,817
Seems there weren't enough men

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,358
for a proper warm-up
spar after your rest.

33
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:05,608
[HYOGA] It's not really
a matter of numbers.

34
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,650
The only proper fighter
here, by which I mean,

35
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,192
the only one I wouldn't
want to fight... is you.

36
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,858
You're the "strongest
primate high schooler,"

37
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:18,275
Shishio Tsukasa, after all.

38
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:20,067
I'm glad you've joined us.

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,900
Let me show you
around our new world.

40
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:50,150
As you see, nature's
bounty is generous.

41
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,775
We want for nothing.

42
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,317
The world was
like this for ages.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,817
Well before human civilization.

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,400
It belonged to no one.

45
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,692
[TSUKASA] However, from the
moment you and I were born,

46
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:09,400
the old world hammered
a message into our heads.

47
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,358
"This world is not yours,

48
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,900
because there's not a single
square centimeter of land on it

49
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:18,900
that isn't already the property
of some rich old fool."

50
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,150
[MINAMI]
Yeah, it's true.

51
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,608
I worked myself ragged,
day in and day out,

52
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,525
only to give up most of my
money to someone else as rent.

53
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,192
Looking back on it,
that's just slavery.

54
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:34,025
The privileged elders
were ruthlessly exploiting

55
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,567
the impoverished young.

56
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,025
The old world worked by theft
and rampant corruption.

57
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:41,733
I'm a lot happier now
in this new world.

58
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,317
[chuckles]

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,108
Although part of that
is due to I was already

60
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,858
a super fan of Mr. Strongest
Primate, Tsukasa.

Yo, we caught a big 'ol sucker!

Check it out. Whaddaya
think about this?

64
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,692
[TSUKASA]
Oh. Excellent work.

65
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,317
I'm just happy we
were finally able...

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,817
[GEN]
Well, even in the old world,

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,108
Tsukasa was an extremely
charismatic fellow.

68
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,150
[TSUKASA]
I appreciate it.

69
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,275
[GEN] Take someone strong,
handsome, and soft-spoken,

70
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:12,608
give him a half-decent argument,

71
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,983
and it'll be prove awfully
difficult to talk anyone

72
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,108
into turning their back on him.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,483
[TSUKASA] Hyoga, the way things
were 3,7000 years ago,

74
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,067
would you call that a utopia?

75
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,983
[HYOGA]
No.

76
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,733
[TSUKASA] Suppose those
in the privileged class

77
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:36,733
of the old world
were revived today.

78
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,275
And they obtained the
weapons of science

79
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,692
that make killing so easy.

80
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,692
What would happen?

81
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,900
[HYOGA] I imagine they'd
try to use those weapons

82
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,358
to recreate the pyramid
of wealth and influence

83
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,275
they once stood upon.

84
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,775
No one who has drank
of that sweet nectar

85
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,192
could be compelled
to abandon it.

86
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,900
Regardless, this world
has been reset.

87
00:04:56,983 --> 00:05:01,317
It's in no condition to
support seven billion lives.

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,358
So there must be a culling.

[GEN] The two deadliest
warriors alive today,

90

and they're in total
agreement with each other.

91
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:13,150
[TSUKASA] Then it is up to the

92
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,525
in harmony with nature.

93
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:19,067
The world of the past
must stay in the past.

94
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:27,275
There was... well, I'm hesitant
to call him a friend.

95
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:28,775
But there was a man named Senku

96
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,192
who had a superhuman
grasp of science.

97
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,817
He sought to revive
the old world.

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,983
Therefore... I had to kill
him with my own hands.

99
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,567
With no Senku, there
will be no science.

100
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,108
The corrupt human race
will be purified

into a new world.

To accomplish that goal,

00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,567
I'll stain my hands as
much as necessary.

and sentimental

161
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,150
that they wouldn't even
abandon a village guard.

162
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,192
Why the hell does that matter?

163
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,442
I know!

164
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,067
We're gonna snatch up
one of them little brats

165
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,442
that we smoked outta there
and use 'em as a hostage!

166
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,150
Yeah, that's a great idea!

167
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,733
[laughs]

168
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:23,150
There's no guarantee
they'll attack head-on.

169
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,442
Keep your eyes and ears
open for anything.

170
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,442
Uh, can we really
protect this many people?

171
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,567
Put all the children up in the
science shed! They'll be safer.

172
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,150
[GINRO]
Yeah! Right!

173
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,942
[GINRO screams]

174
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,317
[SENKU]
Grab water!

175
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,733
Come on now, hurry!

176
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,108
[SENKU] We gotta start dousing
it before it spreads!

177
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,900
It's gonna burn down!

178
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,608
Chrome spent his entire life
collecting those minerals,

179
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,192
and we spent months and months
building the lab together!

180
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,858
If we lose it,
it's all over for us.

181
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:02,108
The Kingdom of Science--
I've gotta protect it somehow!

182
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:04,608
[AKASHI]
Huh?

183
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:05,942
Look!

184
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,192
There's some dumb kid who
didn't get away in time!

185
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,067
[GOZAN] Oh, yeah! We found
ourselves a hostage, boys!

186
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:18,900
[HYOGA] She's so devoted
that she'd sacrifice herself

187
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,608
to help the others?

188
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:23,483
I certainly appreciate
her naiveté.

189
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,275
We only need one captive to win,

190
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,775
and this will be far easier
than attacking the home base

191
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:30,192
of those soldiers of science.

192
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,525
[SUIKA] Gotta run a little,
then hide a little.

193
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,692
Gotta get 'em far away from
the Kingdom of Science!

194
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,858
If I run upwind
towards the mountain,

195
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,733
they won't be able to smoke
me out with more fire!

196
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,442
[AKASHI grunts]

197
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,983
She's runnin' that
way, you guys!

198
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,775
What? Suika ran away?

199
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:52,567
I, uh, tried to stop her!

200
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,733
But she took off toward
the hot springs!

201
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,317
[KOHAKU]
Wait a sec.

202
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,108
I come here all the time to get
water from these hot springs.

203
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,400
[SENKU]
It gets dangerous up ahead.

204
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,442
The poison gases that form here,

205
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:08,942
the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur
dioxide, are heavier than air.

206
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,192
A powerful wind's blowing
in from the mountains.

207
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:16,650
[SENKU] There's something
strange about this wind.

208
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,608
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

209
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,025
[GOZAN]
Just give up already!

210
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:26,817
[MORITO] When we catch this
brat, I say we break her legs!

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,942
[gasps]

212
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,942
[giggling]

213
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,775
[HOMURA]
This wind brings death.

214
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:45,192
[screams]

215
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:48,525
Suika! Climb up that tree!

216
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,692
[SUIKA]
Ah! Wh-What just happened?

217
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:56,942
[KOHAKU]
You don't need to worry.

218
00:13:57,025 --> 00:14:00,358
The poison gas will
settle below us.

219
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,692
What? "Poison gas"? Uh.

220
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:17,900
[SENKU] Mother Nature is
neither friend nor foe.

221
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,483
Heh.

222
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,817
She's doesn't care
one way or another.

223
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Hey, ya pipsqueak!

224
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,650
You were the one who made
all this poison gas, huh?

225
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,692
[SENKU]
Huh?

226
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,692
Yeah, damn right it was me!

227
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:33,233
That was a pretty dumbass move,

228
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,817
launching an attack on
the Kingdom of Science.

229
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,192
You never had a chance
against our modern weapons.

230
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:42,400
Now then, it's time
to head back.

231
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,275
Just breathe nice and slow,
Suika, you'll be fine.

232
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,108
[SUIKA]
Right! I'll do my best!

233
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,525
[SENKU chuckles]

234
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,817
[SENKU]
You guys can go back home

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,900
and suckle on
Mama Tsukasa's teat.

236
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:55,733
Of course, you'll have to wait
about ten billion seconds

237
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:58,067
for the gas to clear outta here.

238
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,233
[GOZAN]
Ugh. He's just screwin' with us.

239
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:05,942
No way we're waitin' that long!

240
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,525
[AKASHI]
Yeah, I mean it's not like

241
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,733
he could actually make poison
gas in the Stone World, right?

242
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:14,983
[HYOGA] Good point.
Let's deal with this properly.

243
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:18,442
We'll need to make sure the gas
is gone before we move.

244
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,358
This is a great opportunity.

245
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,358
You lot can finally perform
a job as you should,

246
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,275
despite your mushy brains.

247
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,525
[GOZAN screams]

248
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,400
[screaming]

249
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,358
[HYOGA] Well, look at that.
They actually died.

250
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:49,983
So those gas masks were
real, at the very least.

251
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,817
It would appear that
Senku and his allies

252
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,025
have a variety of metals and
chemicals under their control.

253
00:15:57,108 --> 00:16:00,067
The Kingdom of Science
is quite a force.

254
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,650
We can always rebuild
our lost homes!

255
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,525
But our peoples'
lives are precious,

256
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,400
and we didn't lose a single one!

257
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,025
Which means Ishigami Village
has won this battle!

258
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,650
[VILLAGERS cheering]

259
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,358
Hey. I am so proud
of you, Suika.

260
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,775
[SUIKA giggles]

261
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:19,358
[KASEKI] But that was
pretty dang reckless.

262
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,942
[HYOGA] We'll have to crush
them with sheer numbers.

263
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,442
Tsukasa and I will lead
the charge, of course.

264
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,108
Backed up by the most
massive and powerful army

265
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,567
that our empire can muster.

266
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,400
[chuckles]

267
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,358
[VILLAGERS chattering]

268
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,567
So what's your next move?

269
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,692
You've managed to hide
for quite a while,

270
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,692
but they'll tell
Tsukasa you're alive.

271
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,025
Yeah, and I'm sure
he'll figure out

272
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,150
we can't produce the
gunpowder that quickly.

273
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,192
At least not enough to use guns.

274
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,275
Huh? What do you mean we can't?

275
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,400
Why would that be?

276
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,942
[SENKU]
It's like this.

277
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,817
The revival fluid
that Tsukasa's guys

278
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,275
have been cranking out is
actually pretty easy to make.

279
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:20,983
And yet, we still haven't
revived a single statue.

280
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,025
That's because we don't
have enough nitric acid.

281
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,525
Now we could make some
from dung or sea shells,

282
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,400
but we're short on both
time and materials.

283
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,692
Also, no nitric acid
means no gunpowder.

284
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:36,358
Tsukasa's smart enough to
figure that out on his own.

285
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,733
[chuckles]

286
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,858
We didn't have much gunpowder
saved to begin with

287
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,733
and now we're completely out.

288
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:43,150
You lost me the moment

289
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,400
you started talking about
that whatever-it-was acid.

290
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,275
Isn't there an easier way
to explain it to us?

291
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,317
[SENKU sighs]

292
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,733
Listen, even if we have guns,

293
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,900
he'll know that we
can't really use them.

294
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,525
And I'd say there's about a
ten billion percent chance

295
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,025
Tsukasa's gonna have a huge
army built up for the invasion.

296
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,442
The more time passes,

297
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:04,150
the more fighters
they have, after all.

298
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,650
Too bad we can't do
that with gunpowder.

299
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,733
[laughs]

300
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:08,858
Ah!

301
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,233
Well? So what're we gonna do?

302
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:15,025
Ah. I think it's
fairly obvious.

303
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,233
We'll just have to
attack them first.

304
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:19,983
With a ridiculously
awesome scientific toy.

305
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,733
[ALL gasp]

306
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,108
Ha! You've got the right idea!

307
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,067
Waiting puts us
at a disadvantage.

308
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,775
So our only choice
is to strike first!

309
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,233
[GINRO whimpering]

310
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,775
And to that end, we gotta start
building our new weapon.

311
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,483
Uh. So what kinda weapon
are you talking about?

312
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,442
[SENKU chuckles]

313
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,108
We've gone leaps and bounds,

314
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,650
but now it's time
for us to break out

315
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,608
the ultimate modern tech!

316
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,858
We've been recreating
scientific advancements

317
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,108
from as far back
as the stone age,

318
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:51,108
but we're finally getting
to something from my time.

319
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,733
What was truly the deciding
factor in modern conflicts.

320
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,858
The strongest weapon in two
million years of history.

321
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,358
Wait, you don't mean
nukes, do you?

322
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,108
Hell no.

323
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:05,233
There's something else that can
give one side a huge advantage.

324
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,983
I'm talking about
communications technology.

325
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,275
We're gonna make
cellular phones

326
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,817
with service even
in the Stone World.

327
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,692
[SUIKA]
Huh?

328
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:14,567
Cell...

329
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,275
...u..?

330
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,608
...lar?

331
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,900
[GEN]
Has he lost his mind?

332
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:23,900
Because he just said
something really crazy.

333
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:26,567
[MAGMA]
Huh? Cellular phones?

334
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,775
What're those? Are they fish?

335
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:31,733
[VILLAGERS chattering]

336
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,817
[VILLAGER B]
They work from a distance?

337
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,608
So you can have a
conversation with someone...

338
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,900
[SUIKA] ...even if
they're super far away?

339
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,942
Definitely sounds
like sorcery to me!

340
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,067
How could an idea that
crazy even possibly exist?

341
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,692
So bad! I've gotta
know how that works!

342
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,067
Me, too!

343
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,817
And that's gonna be our weapon?

344
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,317
Oh, you bet it will.

345
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,192
Communications can completely
turn the tide in a battle.

346
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,192
Look, suppose we
have a double agent

347
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,858
who leaks intel
to us in real time.

348
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,608
It's Gen reportin'.

349
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:05,317
Senku, the enemy is completely
wide open on the west side.

350
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,358
There's barely any guards
to speak of. Over.

351
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,150
[GEN]
It's Gen reportin'.

352
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,900
Senku, the enemy is completely
wide open on the west side.

353
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,525
There's barely any guards
to speak of. Over.

354
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,025
Now that's some excitin' intel!

355
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,858
We're gonna go nuts
on their western flank!

356
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,192
[SENKU] And if we coordinate
our efforts correctly,

357
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:28,775
we might take down the Tsukasa
Empire without bloodshed.

358
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:31,733
But who would we use
to be our double agent?

359
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,692
Ah?

360
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,775
We've already got our
mole over there.

361
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,275
[BOTH laugh]

362
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,358
[SENKU]
Two of 'em in fact.

363
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,358
Taiju and Yuzuriha.

364
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:51,275
[TAIJU]
Smartphones!

365
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:52,900
[SENKU]
Oh, sure, yeah.

366
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:55,483
Smartphones would be
great, wouldn't they?

367
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,650
[TAIJU]
Smartphones?

368
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,775
[SENKU]
You do love your smartphones.

369
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,358
[chuckles]

370
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,942
That big oaf was desperate to
get his hands on a smartphone

371
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,567
from the very beginning.

372
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,483
Now, he's finally
gonna get his wish.

373
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,858
[SENKU] Granted, this'll be
more like a regular phone,

374
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,025
not necessarily the smart kind.

375
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,025
[laughs]

376
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,775
We can do this!

377
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:25,067
That sulfa drug was a
hell of a lotta work,

378
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,692
but we made that
happen, didn't we?

379
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,025
No offense, guys,

380
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,233
but I don't think you
realize what he's saying.

381
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:34,317
This road map's full of things
that are impossible to get.

382
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,817
[SENKU chuckles]

383
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,817
Nothing is impossible, Gen.

384
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,483
No matter how far off
the goal may seem,

385
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,108
if you follow the steps,

386
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:47,900
you'll get there ten billion
percent of the time.

387
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,567
That's how science works.

388
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:04,525
[HYOGA] Every single one
of Gen's reports was a lie.

389
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:08,567
The village already has
considerable scientific power.

390
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:13,858
[HYOGA]
And what's more, Senku is alive.

391
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:15,150
[gasps]

392
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,108
[chuckles]
