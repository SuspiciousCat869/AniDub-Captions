1
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:10,608
[TAIJU]
He was called

2
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:13,233
"the strongest primate
high-schooler."

3
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,650
Shishio Tsukasa.

4
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,233
[TSUKASA]
As long as we're together,

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,525
the two of you will not
be in danger again.

6
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:24,983
From now on, I'll take
care of all the fighting.

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,983
But I have a nagging
feeling that the new guy

8
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:28,983
may be a little bit too strong.

9
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,275
[TSUKASA]
Heh.

10
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:33,525
[TSUKASA]
Tell me something, Senku.

11
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:34,567
Are you planning to bring back

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,358
all the greedy,
black-hearted adults

13
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,400
who ruined the world
we came from?

14
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,983
We live in the Stone World now.

15
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:44,275
A paradise that hasn't
been ruined by greed.

16
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:47,483
I think we should only revive
the young and pure-hearted,

17
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,608
and make sure that we
keep this world natural

18
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,692
and not owned by anyone.

19
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:56,150
This is our chance
to purify humanity.

20
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:59,525
Don't you agree with me, Senku?

21
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:07,233
[SENKU]
This guy's gonna be trouble.

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,025
But if we hadn't woken
him up right then,

23
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,525
we would've been
lion chow for sure.

24
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,233
The situation forced our hand.

25
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,775
Now he tells me he only
wants to save the young.

26
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,150
I doubt do he'll anything rash

27
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,567
until he learns how to make
his own revival potion.

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,608
So no matter what,
I have to stay tight-lipped

29
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,358
about the miracle
fluid in the cave.

30
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,108
[TAIJU]
Hey!

31
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:29,567
Awesome news, you guys!
Check this out! You see?

32
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,858
I got a whole pot full of
miracle fluid from the cave!

33
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,358
And that means we
can use this stuff

34
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,608
to finally bring back Yuzuriha!

35
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:39,525
[wheezes]

36
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,900
[TAIJU]
Huh?

37
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,317
So what's this "miracle
fluid" you're talking about?

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,525
[gasps]

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,317
[chuckles]

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,650
[SENKU] I won't waste
my breath trying

41
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,817
to explain the
science behind it.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,108
Showing you will be ten
billion times faster.

43
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:59,358
I hope you realize what
an honor this is.

44
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:03,067
You're getting to witness
humanity's revival firsthand.

45
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,817
Okay, Yuzuriha.

46
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,358
I promised we'd save you,

47
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,025
and it's happening
for real this time.

48
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,650
[SENKU]
What the hell?

49
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,733
For some reason, we don't
have enough revival fluid

50
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,983
for even one person.

51
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,442
Crap! Did I really
get it too soon?

52
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:56,775
Just grab some more.

53
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,858
We'll hang back and play
20 questions or something

54
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,192
while you're gone.

55
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,358
But do try and make it quick,
would ya, big oaf?

56
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,775
Of course! Be back
before you know it!

57
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,650
Full steam ahead!

58
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:10,858
[TAIJU yelps]

59
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,067
[TSUKASA]
I'm the fastest,

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,067
so it makes more
sense for me to go.

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,025
But I'll need to know
exactly where to find

62
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,608
this "miracle fluid."

63
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,108
[chuckles]

64
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,942
[SENKU] Yep, I knew he couldn't
resist taking the bait.

65
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:25,983
Once he finds the source
of the miracle fluid

66
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,275
and decides to keep
it for himself,

67
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,858
there's a ten billion
percent chance

68
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:32,900
he'll stop my plan of
bringing everyone back.

69
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,317
Tsukasa's gone, isn't he?

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,567
Yeah. Like a bolt of lightning.

71
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,317
Never seen a guy move so-- Uh!

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,150
[SENKU]
Let's make some revival juice!

73
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,358
We'll bring her back A.S.A.P.

74
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,733
Before he has a
chance to return.

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,817
[TSUKASA]
Bats.

76
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:05,192
[TSUKASA] Touching it
turns my finger yellow.

77
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:09,317
I see. So the miracle
fluid is just nitric acid.

78
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,400
[TAIJU]
What's going on?

79
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,900
You literally just said there
wasn't enough revival fluid!

80
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,400
Do you really believe I would
set out a collection pot

81
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:29,525
that was the wrong size?

82
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,942
No, you wouldn't!

83
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,483
Then why did you send Tsukasa
out to get some more?

84
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,942
It's a calculated risk.

85
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,317
I wanted him gone
before we revived her.

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,192
Even if it meant revealing
the location of the cave.

87
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,317
Why would you want
to get rid of Tsukasa?

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,108
He's like totally awesome!

89
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:47,275
[SENKU] That's why he's
too much to handle.

90
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,442
He wants to remake this
world into a place

91
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,483
where only the strong survive.

92
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,483
And that kind of thinking
doesn't move me one millimeter.

93
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,900
Heh.

94
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:59,817
But a civilization-building
game gets me excited.

95
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,192
Yeah, okay. No need to explain.

96
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:08,192
It's cool. I trust you to
make the right decision.

97
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,817
Something happened
while I was gone, huh?

98
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,567
You're right.

99
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,858
Shishio Tsukasa is
an awesome guy.

100
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,400
[SENKU]
Who happens to be a murderer.

101
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,400
[TAIJU] Yuzuriha. Sorry to keep
you waiting, but I'm here.

102
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,317
Just like I said.

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,192
I'll help you.

104
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:38,108
Did you forget that we're
in a hurry, ya big oaf?

105
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,108
[TAIJU yells]

106
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,442
You just dumped it?

107
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,108
We should be more
like, you know!

108
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,525
[TAIJU] Wait, why is
nothing happening?

109
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,775
Don't worry,
Yuzuriha, it's fine!

110
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,692
Is this fine, Senku?

111
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,067
Well, the reaction
isn't instantaneous.

112
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,067
The petrification is
much like cryostasis.

113
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,317
The stone shell acts
as a protective coating

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
made from trace
metals in the body.

115
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,900
An unknown process caused
them to phase shift,

116
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,025
and they took on
a petrified state.

117
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:10,108
You lost me, Senku!
It's so complicated!

118
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,150
[SENKU]
Tch. That's my theory at least.

119
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,192
Based on an entire year of
painstaking experiments.

120
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,858
Anyway, my point being.

121
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,067
If just one part is
exposed to the natal

122
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,650
and begins to break down,
it initiates a chain reaction

123
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,025
that ripples across
the organism's body.

124
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,442
And the petrification is undone.

125
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,650
[gasps]

126
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,817
[TAIJU]
It's like this, Yuzuriha.

127
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,192
I've kept this inside
me for five years.

128
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,775
I'm gonna tell Yuzuriha.

129
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,567
I'm gonna survive this,
even if it kills me!

130
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,067
I was able to stay alive
because of you.

131
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,608
Sorry. But I just
couldn't protect you.

132
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:51,983
[TAIJU]
I've loved you.

133
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:56,650
For hundreds and
thousands of years.

134
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,567
Yuzuriha! Please
open your eyes.

135
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,733
That you, Taiju?

136
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:23,650
I didn't mean to make
you wait 3,700 years.

138
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,733
Forgive me.

139
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,733
[YUZURIHA]
What's going on?

140
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,233
It's like I've been
asleep forever.

141
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:34,858
But still, I... I feel
like you saved me.

142
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,567
You did, right?

143
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,900
You saved me from something.

144
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,942
Oh, wow. Thank you.

145
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,900
[TAIJU] It wasn't me.
Senku did all the work.

146
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:53,733
He spent a whole year
working on that revival fluid.

147
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,817
[SENKU] Pardon the intrusion
on your big moment,

148
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,067
but you need to make a
decision before he gets back.

149
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,025
There're only two options,
so choose carefully.

150
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:07,233
Plan A: The two of you
run away this instant

151
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,192
and find a new place to live.

152
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,983
The farther the better.

153
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,900
Plan B: We join together

154
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,775
and fight to stop
Tsukasa's murder spree,

155
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:18,067
using the weapons
of civilization.

156
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,358
Come on, man!

157
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,733
Obviously, we'll stay
and fight by your side!

158
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,483
I mean really, what kinda
people do you think we are?

159
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,025
[YUZURIHA]
Mh-hm!

160
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,608
I have no clue what's going on,
but I'll help however I can!

161
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,192
[SENKU]
I'm not making any assumptions

162
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,650
or trying to be nice.

163
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,483
It just seems logical to give
you the chance to flee.

164
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,733
Listen, Senku!

165
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,150
If Tsukasa is killing
people, we've got no--

166
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,317
[TSUKASA]
So I'm "killing people"?

167
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Huh. I'd say that's a
matter of perspective.

168
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,067
[BOTH gasp]

169
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,067
[TSUKASA]
I call it culling them.

170
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,483
For the benefit of
the new world.

171
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,233
[chuckles]

172
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,692
[SENKU]
He's not even trying to hide

173
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,775
his murderous intentions
in front of them.

174
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,442
Which means anyone
who gets in his way...

175
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,692
[gasps]

176
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,150
[TAIJU] Senku, if things go bad,
please take care of Yuzuriha.

177
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,650
I'm gonna stop him!
Right here and now!

178
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,108
[yells]

179
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,150
[SENKU]
You pea-brained idiot!

180
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,900
This guy killed a freakin'
lion with his bare hands!

181
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,442
You're ten billion
percent screwed!

182
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,275
[grunts]

183
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:31,775
[SENKU]
Now I've got no choice

184
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:34,233
but to bust out
my secret weapon!

185
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:37,733
[TAIJU yells]

186
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,233
[SENKU]
By shooting at him now,

187
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,650
I can at least break
up their fight!

188
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,983
[gasps]

189
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,358
Nobody has ever taken one
of my kicks full force

190
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,275
and remained standing before.

191
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,983
It's true, but what's
even more interesting

192
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,025
is the feeling I get that
you actually refused

193
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,900
to attack me just now.

194
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:06,900
Why is that?

195
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,650
I don't hit anyone!

196
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,858
You can hit me or kick me or
whatever the hell you wanna do!

197
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:15,442
But I'm tellin' ya! You gotta
stop breaking those statues!

198
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:18,900
Because killing is wrong!
End of story!

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,608
Taiju, let me make sure
I understand you.

200
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,192
You'll let me pummel
you as much as I like

201
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,858
so I stop breaking
those statues.

202
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,150
That's what you're
saying, right?

203
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,733
Yeah! Exactly!

204
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,317
[sighs]

205
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,525
I don't understand.

206
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,483
You aren't making
any kind of deal.

207
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,317
[chuckles]

208
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,025
But if you insist
on getting in my way--

209
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:48,192
I don't care how many times
you wanna come at me,

210
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,150
I'm not gonna stop
trying to stop you!

211
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,483
[TSUKASA]
That girl you just revived,

212
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,692
what if I told you
I'd kill her instead?

213
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,817
[TAIJU gasps]

214
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,108
[YUZURIHA]
I get it now.

215
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,358
This is why Senku was telling
us to run away before.

216
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,608
[YUZURIHA]
Huh? No! Taiju!

217
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,817
Seems it did hurt him. He's
bleeding like a stuck pig.

218
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,608
He'll need a couple of
days to sleep it off.

219
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:20,817
Yeah. So let's not
fight each other.

220
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,192
You just protect your girlfriend

221
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,692
and quit worrying about
some random statues.

222
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,233
Meanwhile, I will do
what I need to do.

223
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,275
[TSUKASA]
Stay out of my way.

224
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,817
That arrow I shot was moving
at over 200 kilometers per hour.

225
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,817
That's crazy.
He just grabbed it.

226
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,025
[SENKU]
Nap time's over! Rise and...

227
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,275
What're you doing?

228
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,442
You said he needed to
sleep for a few days!

229
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,025
Give me a freakin' break!

230
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,275
Is this it?

231
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,942
You're just gonna lose
that easily, ya big oaf?

232
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,650
No way! Not me!

233
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,150
Oh, wow! Are you really okay?

234
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,358
I'm made of stronger
stuff than that!

235
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,650
And I'm still
crazy-full of energy!

236
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,150
Well, thank goodness.

237
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,108
[gasps] We gotta stop him!

238
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:11,525
Before he can murder
anybody else!

239
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:12,775
Wait, ya big oaf!

240
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,817
I won't give up that easy!

241
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,983
Don't you understand
what just happened?

242
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,442
He showed us we can't
stop him with brute force!

243
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,858
Still, we gotta do somethin'.

244
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,733
[SENKU]
In the Stone World,

245
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:31,483
there's only one sure-fire
path to defeating a monster.

246
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,775
Advancing civilization,
and crafting weapons of science!

247
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,900
[cracking]

248
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,525
Uh. That seems wasteful.

249
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,192
The heck are you doin', Senku?

250
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,275
Staging a scene, obviously.

251
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,567
This way it'll look like
he freaked us out so badly,

252
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,483
we just took some
food and ran off.

253
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,525
Whaddaya mean by that?
Are we really gonna give up?

254
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,317
No, but it'll look like it.

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,442
[chuckles]

256
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,025
If we can make some
weapons of science

257
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,025
before he realizes what
we're really up to,

258
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:08,692
then victory is ours.

259
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,650
But if he gets wise
to us? Game over.

260
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,858
The race is on, you guys.

261
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,608
We're gonna hunt for
materials to make weapons.

262
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,858
Starting at Hakone!

263
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:24,858
Just think of it as a big,
80-kilometer adventure!

264
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,900
[TAIJU]
That's like two full marathons.

265
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,025
We can knock it
out in five hours.

266
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,650
[SENKU] Maybe a freak
of nature like you can.

267
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,442
[YUZURIHA] The cherry blossoms
seem different somehow.

268
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,358
Because the ones we're used to,

269
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,858
called Prunus yedoensis,
aren't self-pollinating.

270
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,442
And that means?

271
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,983
[SENKU] They must've gone
extinct right off the bat.

272
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:57,317
[TAIJU gasps]

273
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,025
[SENKU groans]

274
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,983
Man, what an amazing view!

275
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,567
It's perfect.

276
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,233
Uh. What's that thing? A scope?

277
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,733
[SENKU]
A sextant.

278
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:13,858
It's been 35,970 seconds
since sunrise.

279
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,650
You just spit that number
out like it was no big deal.

280
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,233
Well, while he was a statue,

281
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,650
he counted for hundreds
of billions of seconds.

282
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,525
So he's pretty
good at it by now.

283
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,067
A sextant is supposed
to tell you

284
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,442
your exact location
based on the time.

285
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,942
Unfortunately, this one
seems to be total garbage.

286
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,567
[sighs]

287
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,150
[SENKU] But without GPS,
this is all we've got.

288
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm guessing we're
around Kamakura,

289
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,775
but I'd love to know
our true coordinates.

290
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:39,942
Huh.

291
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,192
Think there're still
any buildings

292
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,650
we can use as landmarks?

293
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,192
They've all crumbled
after this long.

294
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,858
There's nothing left.

295
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,275
Hey, is something the matter?

296
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:56,733
[YUZURIHA]
Isn't that--?

297
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,567
[YUZURIHA] It looks like
there's some kind of clearing

298
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,192
in the trees up ahead!

299
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,442
Kamakura's landmark's
still standing.

300
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,858
[laughs]

301
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,692
Our location

302
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:23,442
is 35 degrees, 19 minutes north
by 139 degrees, 32 minutes east.

303
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:37,817
Look, you see?

304
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,025
Hey! What's wrong, Yuzuriha?!

305
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:53,400
Did someone make
you cry?! Was it me?!

306
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:55,317
[YUZURIHA]
I'm not crying!

307
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I mean, I am, but it's
not that kind of crying,

308
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:02,192
'cause it's not
anybody's fault, okay?

309
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,692
It's just... this is a
lot for me to handle.

310
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,150
I haven't been up
for a full day,

311
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,650
and none of this
feels real to me yet.

312
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:13,025
But seeing the Great Buddha
of Kamakura like this

313
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,400
makes me realize that
we really are in Japan,

314
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:19,692
and thousands of years
have passed by without us.

315
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,150
I thought about my mom,
and my dad, and everyone else.

316
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,817
And I just...

317
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,692
C'mon, there's nothin'
to worry about.

318
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,900
We're gonna beat Tsukasa
before too long,

319
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:41,275
then saving humanity is
right around the corner.

320
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,608
Senku's right, ya know!

321
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,108
Thank the Great Buddha here
for showing us the way!

322
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,483
He's still standing strong
after thousands of years,

323
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,900
just like a god!

324
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,900
Hm? Or like a buddha.

325
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:57,025
Well, anyway, it's
a true inspiration!

326
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,567
[laughing]

327
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,942
Well, yeah. The statue's
made outta bronze.

328
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:05,733
The chemical compound's
resistant to corrosion.

329
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:06,858
Look, though!

330
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,483
There's no trees or
plants or anything

331
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,067
growing around the Buddha!

332
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,192
Kinda like he wanted us to find
him so he made it super easy!

333
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,858
Well, yeah. It's leaking
copper ions like crazy.

334
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:20,317
And those are toxic to
most kinds of vegetation.

335
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,358
That gives me an idea, though!

336
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:25,400
We'll use bronze
to make mirrors.

337
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,733
Time to give my crappy
sextant an upgrade!

338
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:29,525
I just need some of this, so...

339
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,733
No, stop! Ah!
That is like, so wrong!

340
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,442
Don't hurt the Great Buddha!

341
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,858
[SENKU]
You're too superstitious!

342
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,233
He'd want us to survive anyway!
I believe in science!

343
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,567
We need the resources, you
dumb ox! Don't you wanna live?

344
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,358
[SENKU]
What the hell are you doing?

345
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,192
Guarding us against predators.

346
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,942
And Tsukasa might
come after us, too.

347
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:10,150
Sorry, man, but if the lion
killer finds us, we're screwed.

348
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,483
So stressing about
him is illogical.

349
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,317
[TAIJU]
Hm?

350
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,525
Seriously?

351
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,192
Just go to sleep.

352
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:19,483
You need rest to do
your job, ya big oaf.

353
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,025
[TAIJU yelling]

354
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,025
[SENKU chuckles]

355
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,442
Looks like our big
water buffalo

356
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,275
is actually struggling
a little bit.

357
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:29,233
Don't worry about
me! I got this!

358
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:31,733
There's still plenty of
juice left in the ol' tank!

359
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,983
We'll be just fine. Uh.

360
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:37,608
Hey, Yuzuriha, your toe is
still kinda rocky-lookin'.

361
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:40,650
Yeah, I know. Not gonna
lie, it's not great.

362
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,733
But I don't want you
to worry about me.

363
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,525
But I am worried, tho--

364
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,067
[YUZURIHA]
That's cold!

365
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,733
Feels like the pain is
finally starting to go away.

366
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,275
[TAIJU]
Whoa!

367
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,817
Does the revival fluid have
some kinda healing power, too?

368
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,233
Though that would be amazing,
it's just cracks filling in.

369
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:03,358
Another part of the
de-petrification process.

370
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:07,942
I mean, we're still alive, even
with these cracks in our faces.

371
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,358
Yeah, that's true.

372
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,650
So let's keep going, shall we?

373
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,067
Soon we can soak in some
real rejuvenation fluid.

374
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,150
I just remembered something
that's in Hakone!

375
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,483
[TAIJU gasps]

376
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,025
[TSUKASA]
The room's been torn up,

377
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,817
and there's all
these footprints.

378
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,442
Seems like they
panicked and ran away.

379
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,900
Yeah. That's exactly what
they want me to believe.

380
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,733
I'm no fool.

381
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:42,608
I know Senku's not the kind
of man to turn tail and run.

382
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:45,858
[TSUKASA]
But why would he lie about Taiju

383
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:49,692
being down for the count, and
then secretly head west?

384
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,400
[TSUKASA]
It's obvious.

385
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,817
Senku's planning on using
his knowledge of science

386
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,275
to make weapons to fight me.

387
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,025
But where'd they go?

388
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,192
Ah! We made it
to the goal, guys!

389
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,192
Hot springs here we come!

390
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,733
Wow. And the view of
Mount Fuji is incredible!

391
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,317
It's great, yeah.

392
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,358
But you two better not
forget the real reason

393
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,733
that we traveled all this way.

394
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,525
So what's this
"weapon of science"?

395
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,150
[chuckles]

396
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,192
Oh, just one of the greatest
inventions in human history.

397
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,233
[TAIJU]
Smartphones?

398
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:28,108
You do love your
smartphones. Wrong.

399
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,775
The gun. We're gonna
make some gunpowder.

400
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,233
[SENKU] The stone age was
two million years ago.

401
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:39,275
Gunpowder was invented fairly
recently, in comparison.

402
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:41,025
About 700 A.D.

403
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:46,858
Basically, we're gonna warp
ahead 1,998,700 years.

404
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,733
A giant leap in civilization.

405
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,192
Time to get excited, you guys.

406
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,733
[gasps]

407
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:54,983
[TSUKASA]
Hakone.

408
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,900
If they make gunpowder,
I don't stand a chance.

409
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,858
Senku can do it.

410
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:03,108
So I have to stop him
before that happens.

411
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:07,025
[SENKU] Lucky for us,
Japan is full of volcanoes.

412
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,483
Go to any hot spring and
there's a plethora of sulfur

413
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,067
just waiting to be taken.

414
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,900
And that's the main
component of gunpowder.

415
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,608
[chuckles]

416
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,983
We're about to create our
ultimate weapon against Tsukasa.

417
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,942
Some black powder should
do the trick just fine.
