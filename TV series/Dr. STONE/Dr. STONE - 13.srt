2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,608
I'm so happy to see you!

3
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:19,900
[CHROME]
Biggest hurdle cleared!

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:21,858
Sulfuric acid acquired!

5
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:23,983
Ah. This is so amazing!

6
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,983
We can finally make the
medicine and save Ruri's life!

7
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:30,942
We're still a few steps away.
You gotta have some patience.

8
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,775
You remember that crazy
roadmap to the drug, right?

9
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:36,233
I recall it being
incredibly long.

10
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,108
Heh. No sweat. We're close.

11
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:40,442
We have just about
every component

12
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,692
that we're gonna need now.

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,317
[ALL gasp]

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,858
[SENKU] And since most of
the materials are in place,

15
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:47,983
it's just a matter of lighting
up all the dark spots

16
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,733
on the roadmap, one by one.

17
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,983
Should be pretty easy, actually.

18
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,108
So why don't we light up
all of 'em up today?

19
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:59,067
It's time for a little mad
chemical cooking class.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,442
So you'd better get excited!

21
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,275
[SENKU] First, we boil
the sulfuric acid,

22
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,983
and add a pinch of salt.

23
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,650
This glass thingy is weird.

24
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,233
It looks like there's a stick
in the middle of it.

25
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:49,025
You asked me to make this
bizarre doohickey and I did it!

26
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:50,983
I have no idea what you're
going to use it for,

27
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,067
but you went and got me excited!

28
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,608
[SENKU]
It's part of a dripping system.

29
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:58,108
[CHROME] We're catching the gas
coming out of the sulfuric acid

30
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,358
and salt mixture as it drips.

31
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,108
Hydrochloric acid acquired.

32
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:04,400
Hydrochloric?

33
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:06,733
It's a slightly
dangerous chemical.

34
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,275
Get this stuff in your eyes
and you'll go blind.

35
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:12,483
Next, we take the sinters
from the sulfuric acid spring,

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,525
which some call
"flowers of sulfur,"

37
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,692
boil 'em, throw 'em into
the hydrochloric acid

38
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,858
we just made, and...

39
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,275
Now we have chlorosulfuric acid.

40
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,025
Chlorosulfuric? Uh...

41
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,067
It's a super bad chemical.

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,025
Get this on your skin and you'll
turn into a skulking zombie.

43
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,275
[BOTH yelling]

44
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:36,483
That's good. Smells
like a swimming pool.

45
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,525
We'll separate the salt
water with electricity...

46
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,942
And we've acquired
sodium hydroxide.

47
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,608
Sodi... hydra?

48
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,733
It's an extremely bad chemical.

49
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,400
The yakuza use it to
melt enemy corpses.

50
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,108
[KOHAKU]
Oh. I get it now.

51
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,317
[SENKU]
Huh?

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,483
It makes you blind,
turns you into a zombie,

53
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,942
and melts your corpse.

54
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,900
Is that all?

55
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:01,608
Senku, you're gonna
make Ruri drink that?

56
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,150
[SENKU]
No one's drinking it!

57
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,483
We're just using it
to prepare the drug!

58
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,108
Relax, will ya? All the rest
of the chemicals are harmless.

59
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:10,650
Next up is ammonia.

60
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,733
Let's go!

61
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,150
[KOHAKU]
Where do you get that?

62

00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,525
[SENKU]
Ammonia... acquired.

65
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,108
Do you really think
I'm gonna let you

66
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,608
force my sister to drink that?

67
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,358
[SENKU]
She's not drinking it!

68
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:29,067
We just need it to
prepare the drug!

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,900
All right, we're so
close to getting there.

70
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:33,608
We're down to the
last three items:

71
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:37,400
Acetic anhydride, sodium
bicarbonate, and anilin.

72
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:40,192
[SUIKA] Sounds like you're
casting some kind of spell.

73
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,608
But we need alcohol to make
those. That's the key here.

74
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,025
So if we can get our
hands on some booze,

75
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:47,942
we'll have the
ultimate cure-all.

76
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,650
A powerful sulfa drug.

77

[ALL gasp]

78
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,400
So let's make us
some alcohol then!

79
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,233
That's gonna take a
little time and energy.

80
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,317
Some more manpower
would be great.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,733
Need booze? Funny
you mention it.

82
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,317
Because if you were
to be victorious

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
in the Grand Bout tomorrow,

84
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,525
the villagers will
give you more booze

85
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,525
than you could ever
hope to finish.

[CHROME]
Right.

91
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,567
If Kinro or Ginro wins,
we'll have alcohol,

92
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,525
and then practically
nothing can stop us

93
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,358
from making Ruri's medicine!

94
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:25,858
[SENKU]
Yeah.

95
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,567
Our team is gonna win the

[VILLAGERS chattering]

[KOKUYO]
At last, the time is upon us.

98
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:37,150
Tomorrow, your husband, the new
village chief, will be chosen.

Are you ready for that?

Yes.

[KOKUYO]

Yes.

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,567
Well, I mean... the
preparations are in order,

105
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,317
but there is one thing.

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,067
Why is Kohaku allowed to
take part in this again?

107
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,067
You need to go and
tell her that she can't!

108
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,275
Anybody over 14 and
unmarried can enter.

109
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,358
The sacred rules governing the
Grand Bout can't be changed.

110
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:04,608
When those rules were written,

111
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,983
nobody expected a hard-headed
girl to compete!

112
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,108
Ugh. But I suppose we
should just let it be.

113
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,817
After all, a man who's
unable to defeat a woman

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,983
isn't fit to be the
village chief, anyway.

one more small problem.

You're gonna participate
in the Grand Bout, too?

him up for the big battle!

and unmarried, isn't he?

That's right.

122
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,983
Plus, there's no rule that says

00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,358
you have to be a
villager to participate.

My main goal is just to
tire out our opponents.

on our side, the better!

You're really gonna
rig the Grand Bout?

00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,733
How dishonorable. Even for you.

Either way, although the goal
is worthy, rules are rules.

141

I won't throw my match.

and with honor.

Exactly! Nobody's asking
you to cheat, Kinro.

149

Once you hit us, we're just
gonna cry out "mercy"

think about this?

don't agree with them!

Eh... Honestly?

If this can help
my sister survive,

then I'm left with
no other choice.

00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:37,567
Ha. It's been close to half
a year since Senku arrived.

160
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,358
Now, finally...

161
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:46,858
This is the first time
I've set foot in the village.

162
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,858
Well, I'm here.

163
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:57,358
I take it that's the outsider?

164
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:00,150
The one foolish enough to
enter the Grand Bout?

165
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,983
Yes. His name is Senku.

166
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,358
[gasps]

167
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,733
[RURI]
It's what? Hold on.

168
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:10,233
Did I hear correctly that
this man's name is Senku?

169
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:14,317
It is. I assume you haven't
met him before. Have you?

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
[RURI] No, sir. Of course
I've never met him.

171
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:19,775
How could I have?

172
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:23,067
But yet... I do know him.

173
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,233
This Senku...
Could he be the one?

174
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,192
[BOTH gasp]

175
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,817
Wait, Ruri!

176
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,400
[RURI]
I've known him for years,

177
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,608
possibly even from long,
long ago in the past.

178
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,025
I've heard that
name all my life.

179
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,692
[RURI]
Your name is Senku, is it not?

180
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:43,942
And you're the village
priestess, Ruri. Heh.

181
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,775
So nice to finally
meet you in person.

182
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:48,233
Indeed.

183
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:51,817
I have a very important
question to ask you.

184
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,983
Tell me, please. Senku,
what is your surname?

185
00:09:58,775 --> 00:09:59,567
Say what?

186
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,358
Surname?

187
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:03,775
[RURI] I mean, your family name.
The one that's passed--

188
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:06,317
Yeah. I know what you mean.

189
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,233
[SENKU] There's no tradition of
having surnames in this village,

190
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,192
so how does she know about them?

191
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,567
[RURI] Could it be
that you're... Ishi--

192
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,775
[RURI coughing]

193
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,192
[JASPER]
Priestess Ruri!

194
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,608
Stop there! Stay away from
the priestess, outsider!

195
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:25,233
[KOKUYO] Don't make her walk!
Carry her back immediately!

196
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,483
[TURQUOISE]
Are you all right?

197
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,900
I am.

198
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:32,108
I have about ten billion
questions for her as well.

199
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,150
I think she and I should
have a nice, long chat

200
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,108
after this Grand Bout
business is over.

201
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,942
[MAGMA laughing]

202
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,275
Now we're talkin'.

203
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,525
It looks as though I might not

204
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,733
have to go through the
trouble of killing her.

205
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:46,025
At this rate, she'll probably
keel over on our wedding night.

206
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,692
No, Magma! Anybody but you!

207
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:57,733
Well, look at that.

208
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:58,858
Chrome might actually have

209
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,775
some decent fighting
skills after all.

210
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:01,817
That's true.

211
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,108
Probably because he's been busy

212
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,483
poking that target
like a mad man!

213
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,400
[CHROME] I'm practicing hittin'
Magma's weak spot.

214
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,192
[GINRO]
His weak spot? You mean...

215
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,608
That's right! His junk!

216
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,525
[SUIKA yelps]

217
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,150
It's a sound strategy.

218
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,233
If we're trying to wear him
out in the early rounds,

219
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,275
then his testicles will be
an excellent target to strike.

220
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:21,817
My, Kohaku.

221
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,442
I know you have a reputation
as being somewhat of a tomboy,

222
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,775
but this strategy goes
well beyond that.

223
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,233
Some things should be
off-limits, you know.

224
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:31,733
I realize that I have
no chance of winning,

225
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,400
but if I can land a couple
of good hits on Magma.

226
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:36,900
I can wear him down
for the next person.

227
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,442
That's the best I can
do for our team!

228
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,858
He's right.

229
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,983
That means the order of matches
is going to be crucial.

230
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,900
[GINRO]
Rig the match! Rig the match!

231
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:52,442
Give us an order
that'll let us win...!

232
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,775
Yeah. I say to hell with
trying to have a fair fight.

233
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,650
The Kingdom of Science uses our
wits and cunning as weapons.

234
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:02,442
Our strategy is to game the
Grand Bout to work in our favor.

235
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:05,150
We'll rig it so that Kinro
gets to the top unscathed,

236
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,567
and pit him against
an exhausted Magma.

237
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,900
Which means it's best for us

238
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,608
if Kinro and Magma are
in separate blocks.

239
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,650
The quickest way would be if
I beat Magma in the first match.

240
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,067
That happens, it's smooth
sailing from there.

241
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,275
That's correct.

242
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,983
If you can take him
out early like that,

243
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,483
then we're good as gold.

244
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,233
[SUIKA] Since they're drawing
straws for the order,

245
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,150
all we can do is pray for luck.

246
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,358
Kohaku and Magma
start off together.

247
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,900
Kinro and Magma never
go against each other...

248
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,858
Is that a prayer or some
kinda tongue twister?

249
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,108
[SUIKA] Kinro and Magma
never go against each other.

250
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,317
Kohaku and Magma start...

251
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,275
They're drawing up the
brackets right now.

252
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,067
[SUIKA] Kohaku and Magma
start off together.

253
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,317
Kinro and Magma never
go against each other.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,067
Kohaku and Magma
start off together!

255
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,525
Kinro and Magma never
go against each other!

256
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:51,692
The first round of the Grand
Bout will be between...

257
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,817
[JASPER]
...Kinro and Magma!

258
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,608
[GINRO]
This is bad.

259
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:09,650
This is really bad.
Seriously bad!

260
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,400
It's the exact opposite
of what I prayed for!

261
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,817
Damn it, how could we
have such rotten luck?

262
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,150
[SENKU chuckles]

263
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,650
Well, that's life.

264
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,233
[SUIKA]
Huh?

265
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:21,983
A scientist knows better than
to rely on luck or superstition.

266
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,483
Even if you're dealt
the worst hand,

267
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,442
you play every card you've got.

268
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,858
So we'll have to resort to
doping to win the Grand Bout.

269
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,983
Thus, I've developed
the Kingdom of Science's

270
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,358
special power-up drink!

271
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,775
[OTHER whimpering]

272
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,817
[KOHAKU] Great, another
suspicious chemical creation.

273
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,983
There some kinda bad
drug in that stuff?

274
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,192
[SENKU laughs]

275
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,692
Unfortunately,
it's perfectly safe.

276
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:46,275
It's a mixture made up of tea
leaves, honey, and sweet flag.

277
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,525
The caffeine speeds you up,
sweet flag keeps you cool,

278
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:52,067
and the honey jacks your
blood sugar way up.

279
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,775
It's the Stone World's
version of doping.

280
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:58,567
Did you really just
drink all of it?!

281
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,983
[GINRO] Ah! I didn't know
that was the whole supply!

282
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,442
What do you want me to do?

283
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,025
Because if you lose to Magma,

284
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,733
then that'll mean it'll be
completely up to me to beat him!

285
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,192
He even ate the raw ingredients.

286
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,525
Wow, yeah. There goes our
whole supply of sweet flag.

287
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:14,942
That's the grass, right?

288
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,150
The kind that grows
down by the river?

289
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,108
[SUIKA]
I'll go pick some more for us!

290
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,942
I may not be competing
in the Grand Bout,

291
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,817
but I can still make
myself useful!

292

[chuckles]

293

Here's the plan.

294
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,858
Everything'll be just fine

295
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,650
as long as you make it to the
final match, you got that?

296
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:45,108
[MANTLE]
No! This is horrible!

297

and fell into the river!

I'm afraid the poor
thing's gonna drown!

299
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,858
Kohaku, you're the
fastest one here,

300
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:57,483
so you need to go down and
help her before it's too late!

301
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:02,067
It's ten billion percent obvious
he's lying through his teeth.

302
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,858
Eh?

303
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:06,275
No. I'm telling you
the truth, I swear.

304
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:09,108
I just happened to be walking
by the river when I saw her,

305
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,275
and then she fell in!

306
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,858
If you just happened to see
her fall into the river,

307
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:15,025
how did you know she was there

to pick herbs in
the first place?

309
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,317
Come back in ten billion years

if you really wanna
have a battle of wits

with the Kingdom of Science,
you slimy, pea-brained idiot.

00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,275
but there's a slim
chance that he's not.

314
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:32,150
I can't risk it
and let Suika die.

315
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,650
Yeah, well.

316
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,775
You realize you're our last line
of defense against Magma,

317
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,150
so if you bail on us now...

318
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,275
Look, I'm the fastest
out of all of us,

319
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,275
so I'm the only one
who can save her.

320
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,358
I know it's a little risky,
but I have to go see for myself!

321
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,442
[chuckles]

322
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:54,900
You're disgusting, Mantle.
A despicable person.

327
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,275
[CHROME]
Hey, uh, Kohaku's not here.

328
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,858
She went to save Suika.

329
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,150
She competes in the third round.

330
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,942
If she hasn't returned by then,
she will be disqualified.

331
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:20,942
Damn it! Come on,
Kohaku. Hurry!

[MAGMA laughs]

333
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,025
Excellent work, Mantle.

334
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,817
Ah, yeah! I had to make sure
our problem was solved.

335
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,067
[MAGMA]
Now that Kohaku's gone,

336
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,858
there's no one who
can defeat me.

337
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:34,442
And I, Magma, will
get what I deserve.

338
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,400
Ruri and the entire
village will be mine.

339
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:38,775
Now, Kinro!

340
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,442
Surrender to me and I'll
make you my right-hand man.

341
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,775
I'll need a strong
fighter by my side,

342
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:46,233
as well as someone
who'll do my bidding.

343
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,025
Grovel at my feet
before the crowd.

344
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,983
Put on a show for everyone!

345
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,067
Do that, and I'll take it
as your pledge of loyalty.

346
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,067
[KINRO]
Listen, Magma.

347
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,358
Even if everything
you say is true,

348
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:04,233
I'd never kneel before you.

349
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,025
There are many schemes
in this Grand Bout,

350
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,025
but I can only fight honestly
and to the best of my abilities.

351
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:15,317
Besides, I'm not the
same man I was before.

352
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,275
[MAGMA laughs]

353
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,858
You've never once beaten me
in a match like this, Kinro,

354
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,483
so what's so different
about this time?

355
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,900
[KINRO] This time, I have
no choice but to win,

356
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:30,483
because my friends
are counting on me!

Round one: Magma versus Kinro.

358

Begin!

359
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,233
You're motivated by
a lust for power.

360
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:41,608
But I... have bigger
reasons than that!

[KINRO yelling]

362

you get so strong?

[GAN'EN] Kinro seems to be
holding his own against Magma.

365
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,233
He might actually win
this whole thing!

366
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,650
I gotta say, he's doing
ten billion times better

367
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:01,983
than I was expecting.

368
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,192
This is all thanks to the
training our battle team

had to go through.

so smug about it, Ginro?
