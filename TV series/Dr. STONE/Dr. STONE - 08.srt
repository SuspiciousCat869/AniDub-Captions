1
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,192
[KASEKI] Someone from
outside the village?

2
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,733
Hmmm.

3
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:16,317
I'm positive it's some criminal
we banished a long time ago!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,650
I would bet my next meal on it!

00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,858
[KUJAKU chuckles]

6
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:21,608
Maybe the statue people
have started moving.

7
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,108
[AZURA laughs]

8
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,692
[AZURA]
No way!

9
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,775
[KOKUYO] So somebody tried
to bring in an outsider.

10
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:31,442
Surely that wouldn't have
been Kohaku, would it?

11
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:32,775
We're not quite sure yet.

12
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,358
No, it was definitely her.
Your hunch is correct.

13
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:38,608
Now, Jasper, you heard what
Ginro told us earlier.

14
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:41,900
There's no need to lie
to save her skin.

15
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:44,317
Why must my daughter
be so foolish?

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Is she trying to
be disowned now?

17
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:50,233
She can't keep breaking
the rules! Damn it!

18
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,067
[gasps, coughs]

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,067
[KOKUYO]
Ruri!

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,942
[RURI coughing]

21
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,650
[CHROME]
All right, Senku!

22
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,858
What do we need to do
to make that medicine?!

23
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:07,275
We gotta help Ruri
kick her sickness!

24
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,400
If we can help my
sister feel better,

25
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,775
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes!

26
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,775
[MAN A]
Priestess Ruri!

27
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,692
[WOMAN A]
I'm so worried.

28
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,275
--[RURI] Yay! Yay! Yay...!
--[MAN A] Her sickness is cured!

29
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:22,650
--[RURI] Yay! Yay! Yay...!
--[WOMAN B] Science rules!

30
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,067
[MAN B] I'm gonna join
the Kingdom of Science!

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,192
Do you see that?

32
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,817
That sleazy glint
in his eye tells me

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,233
he wants to save Ruri
for his own reasons.

34
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:34,650
I still can't decide if he's
a gentleman or a slimeball.

35
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,775
But at the very least, I'm glad
that he thinks things through.

36
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,608
[SENKU] The first project
of the Kingdom of Science

37
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,650
is making an antibiotic.

38
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,942
A wonder drug that'll
kill the hostile bacteria

39
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,692
infecting our patient.

40
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,817
Since its discovery in
the early 20th century,

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,025
it's saved hundreds
of millions of lives.

42
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,567
We can't do any blood tests,

43
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,567
and we have no idea what
she's actually suffering from,

44
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,483
but I'm sure it's still
worth trying anyway.

45
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,775
Yeah! Now let's get
to work, Senku!

46
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,983
What do we need?

47
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,067
Well, we're missing
basically everything.

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,025
So pay attention, would ya?

49
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,483
There are two routes
to making antibiotics.

50
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,108
The biological route: Creating
penicillin from living things.

51
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,150
Or the stone route: Creating
"sulfa drugs" from rocks.

52
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,608
[KOHAKU]
Wait just a minute.

53
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,025
Living things? Rocks?

54
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,400
How could you cure
somebody with those?

55
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:28,858
Penicillin, which is made from
green mold, is more well known.

56
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,608
But now, in the Stone World,

57
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,067
I think that would mean
we'd have to play

58
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,608
a crazy game of chance.

59
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,442
We'd be all, like, "Woo-hoo!

60
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,983
We just happened to find this
specific crazy-strong mold

61
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:42,025
that's ten billion times more
powerful than the normal stuff!"

62
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,442
Woo-hoo!

63
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,192
[SENKU] We'll just have to
get on our knees and pray.

64
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:48,233
"Please, Lord, send down some
of that special green mold!

65
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,567
Thanks!"

66
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,025
If we take the stone route
and make sulfa drugs,

67
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:54,650
we'll need a ton of
diligence and manpower.

68
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,275
But even in this
primitive world,

69
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:57,942
I know we can make it happen.

70
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,400
Odds are ten billion to
one we'll nail the cure.

71
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:03,192
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's take the stone route!

72
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:06,150
[SENKU] You get the position
we're in, don't you?

73
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,233
None of us are gods or even
geniuses, to be honest.

74
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,400
We have to do this step by step.

75
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,858
And like they say, we've gotta
crawl before we can walk.

76
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,858
[SENKU] All right,
the stone route it is!

77
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,108
We'll get each item one by one.

78
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,525
And though it seems slow,

79
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,442
we'll be warping straight
through two million years

80
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,525
of scientific progress.

81
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,733
This is the scientific road map,

82
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,067
and if we follow it,
we'll reach our cure.

83
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,817
[KOHAKU gasping]

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,733
Whoa, man. That's bad!

85
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,233
Well, guess this
"iron" stuff is first!

86
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:24,733
I don't even know what that is!

87
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,358
There's so much for me to learn!

88
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,775
Iron's not particularly
easy to get.

89
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,192
Professor Senku's science class.

90
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,067
Or is it really sorcery?

91
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,650
Ugh, I feel like
I'm already behind.

92
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:39,608
[CHROME]
Seriously?

93
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,067
Bad!

94
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,025
You're telling me that
it's actually the planet

95
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,192
that's moving?

96
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,525
Yeah, it's not a lie.

97
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,108
[KOHAKU]
That doesn't make any sense.

98
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,525
I mean, if that's
really the case,

99
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:52,025
then why am I not
flying off this branch?

100
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,317
That's because of a little
thing that we call "gravity."

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,067
You know, I always
thought it was weird

102
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,983
how only just one star
stays in the same place.

103
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,400
That's the North Star.

104
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,483
It's ridiculously useful
for navigating

105
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,567
'cause it's ten billion
percent true north.

106
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,983
So try to remember that.

107
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,108
Oh. I didn't know.

108
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,317
If you want my opinion,

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
that looks just slightly
off from true north.

110
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,317
No. Impossible.

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,650
The margin of error is--

112
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,275
[gasps]

113
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:19,608
The Earth's axis has shifted!

114
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,817
The whole planet has been
tilting little by little

115
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,192
over the past 3,700 years.

116
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,567
And now, in the year 5379,

117
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,067
the freaking North
Star isn't north!

118
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,025
[SENKU] No wonder my
stone-age GPS didn't get us

119
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,233
all the way to Hakone.

120
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,608
[chuckles]

121
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:39,358
A more experienced scientist
would've laughed at me.

122
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,608
Kind of a major
oversight on my part.

123
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,025
You guys are more observant

124
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,442
because you don't have the
same preconceived notions.

125
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,650
Bonehead move there, Senku.

126
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:52,192
Heh. Just sounds like
a little mistake.

127
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:55,317
There's no reason to be so
hard on yourself, you know.

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm not trying to
put myself down.

129
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,275
I take pride in being rational
and able to deal with facts,

130
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:04,442
but I still get lost in the
sheer scale of everything.

131
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,150
I feel like it's
just hitting me now

132
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,442
how long 3,700 years really is.

133
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,567
Wait.

134
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,233
How did she know the
former North Star,

135
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,108
wasn't exactly north anymore?

136
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,317
Oh, no way!

137
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,067
You mean to tell me that
even the great Senku

138
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,692
doesn't know about this rock?

139
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,317
I just so happened
to find this bad boy

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
on top of that bald
mountain one day.

141
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,233
If you dangle it or
make it float in water,

142
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,525
this thing always
points true north!

143
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,317
Pretty nuts, isn't it?

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,567
[gasps]

Man! Of course you know!

[SENKU chuckles]

You've done an
excellent job, Chrome.

Check it out! Mine picked
up a buncha that stuff!

152
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,942
Look at this crazy black sand.

153
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,317
[SENKU]
Taking baby steps,

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,817
but we're on the road to
the Kingdom of Science.

155
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,358
The curtain's rising
on the iron age.

156
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,733
Now that gets me excited.

157
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,650
[SENKU] Is everyone in your
village like the lioness,

158
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,733
or is she in a

like a nimble gorilla.

Should I get someone from
the village to help out?

As far as those people

you guys are just a couple
of suspicious sorcerers.

[SENKU] Doesn't her name
mean "watermelon"?

180
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,983
[CHROME] Pretty sure
it's just a nickname.

Probably 'cause she's always
wearing that watermelon rind.

It's kinda hard to be
very useful to anyone

Too bad. I'll wear
it my whole life.

He's the first person I've met

who didn't ask me why I'm
wearing this on my head.

202
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,150
He probably just thought
I didn't want anybody

203
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,192
to see my face and was
being polite by not asking.

204
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,483
You just met him,

205
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,400
but I'm sure you'll figure
it out soon enough.

206
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:22,692
He is not polite.

207
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,567
He doesn't give a crap
what you look like,

only if you're useful.

209
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,275
It's just his way.

210
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,983
[SUIKA]
I'm gonna grab every last piece

211
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,067

Blub-blub, blub-blub!

You're not Momotaro!
Just try not to drown!

214
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,358
[SENKU] Never heard of <i>Dragon</i>
<i>Quest</i> or <i>Monster Hunter</i> ,

215
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,150
but you know <i>Momotaro</i> ?

216
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,483
Who taught you that?

217
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,567
Whoa. You know <i>Momotaro</i> ?

218
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,858
That's weird.

219
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,733
Ruri told us a whole
bunch of stories like his.

220
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,067
Come to think of it,

221
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,108
I wonder how you guys
would know about gorillas.

222
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:54,817
They're not native to Japan.

223
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,983
I've never actually
seen one in real life.

224
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,650
Yeah, but I think there's
a gorilla in <i>Momotaro</i> .

225
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,400
That right?

226
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,400
[SENKU]
No, there isn't!

227
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:05,233
He used those millet dumplings
to make new friends.

228
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,525
A bear, a lion, a gorilla,
and an alligator.

229
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,817
Momotaro isn't a
wild-ass, savage hero!

230
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,733
I wonder if that story
was just an easy way

231
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:16,817
to teach the kids about
dangerous animals.

232
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,025
My sister must've told
me hundreds of stories

233
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,942
when we were
growing up together.

234
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,442
And she loves big words.

235
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,942
I suppose that means I got all
my bigger words from Ruri.

236
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,150
[SENKU]
Is that so? The plot thickens.

237
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,400
[chuckles]

238
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,608
I gotta admit, I'm getting
low-key interested

239
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,692
in this Ruri chick.

240
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,858
And now, I'm that much
more determined

241
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:40,942
to make this medicine and cure
whatever's going on with her.

242
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,775
What the heck do
you mean by that?

243
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,275
Interested? Like, how?

244
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:45,483

He thinks no one knows,

247
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,358
but Chrome's got a
major crush on Ruri.

248
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:55,233
Ahh. So that's what
that was all about.

249

Right. Great. Cool.

250
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,817
And Chrome's totally
like a little kid

251
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,150
about the whole thing.

252
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,400
He's so oblivious it's
almost kinda cute.

253

What're you guys talking
about over there?!

254
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,733
Did you just say
I'm like a kid?!

255
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:09,400
[SUIKA] You're saying
the black sand we got

256
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:12,150
outta the river turns
into this "iron" stuff?

257
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,733
It will.

258
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,025
You mix four parts of the sand
to one part coal and bake it.

259
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,608
Got it. That sounds
pretty easy to me.

260
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:21,608
The bad news is it's way
harder than it sounds.

261
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:24,025
Nothing at all like
baking little clay pots.

262
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,108
That'll be our next
problem to solve.

263
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,858
Wood can burn up to 700 degrees

264
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,567
but iron-making requires
much higher temperatures.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,317
We're talking 1,500
degrees or more.

266
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,817
So how are we gonna
get it that hot?

267
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,942
Is it even possible?

268
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,817
We gotta blow like hell!

269
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,317
We provide it with as
much oxygen as we can,

270
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,192
so we're gonna need to send
in a crazy amount of air,

271
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,692
and hope that it increases
the fire's damage points

272
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:50,733
from 700 to 1,500.

273
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,233
This thing blows air?

274
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:53,650
With a handy little
item like this,

275
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,025
I can probably do it
all by myself.

276
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,150
Try it out and get
back to me on that.

277

We need to know what they want.

It's time for us to
plan an intel mission.

[SUIKA] I'm really good
at that kind of thing!

We're counting on you to find

[VILLAGERS chattering]

328

[CARBO] I heard Kohaku tried
to bring in an outsider.

329
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:30,817
Does anybody know if
they were able to get in,

330
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,358

that he's no threat

Yes, I agree.
Perfectly reasonable.

any monkey business...

how manly I am!

Oh, yeah!

Well, if this outsider

Yeah, see, I don't really care
if he's strong or not.

But if the guy's handsome,
then I might wanna meet him.

I don't need a man

[SUIKA] I went around
the village all day

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,317
and I found out what
most people want.

the sparkly sisters

Oh, boy, they're the most
beautiful girls in the village.

They were talking about what
they want more than anything.

I really hope that it's
something we can create

with our limited
available technology.

00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,400
They want boyfriends!

00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,317
There's no chance in hell
we're making one of those!

about what they're looking for.

Heh. You're not
bad-looking, Senku.

And you do have a certain
kinda charm about you.

But I don't think you're
the type of handsome

really talking about.

and the aftertaste
is horribly bitter.

468
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:42,233
Maybe if you think of it
as medicine, it's edible.

469
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,442
Then again, these
people probably think

470
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,275
it's the food of the gods.

471
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:47,942
And that means
it's gonna work.

472
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:51,192
Foxtail millet ramen
for the win!

473
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,275
[music playing]

474
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:55,442
Huh?

475
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,108
The hell's goin' on?

476
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:04,733
Oh, man, something
smells amazing!

477
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:08,900
[SENKU] People have waged
wars over salt and pepper.

478
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:12,150
That's how fundamental
food is to civilization.

479
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,025
With the raw power
of ramen on my side,

480
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:20,150
soon I'll have complete
control over this village!

481
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,400
You look and sound like
a bad guy right now.
