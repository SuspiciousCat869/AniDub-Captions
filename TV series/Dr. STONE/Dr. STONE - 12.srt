1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,233
So this hair-lookin' stuff's
gonna turn into silver?

2
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:13,567
That's bad.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,817
I was almost positive they
were some kinda roots.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,608
[gasps]

5
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:21,900
So cool.

6
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,317
They're gonna make my
silver spear with that, huh?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,150
Wow! Science is actually
super weird, isn't it?

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,858
Hey, that reminds me...

9
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,317
Kinro, don't you have an
awesome golden spear?

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,525
Oh, whoops.

11
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,483
I remember now.
You don't have one!

12
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,150
I kinda can't believe
we're only gonna have

13
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,650
the silver one and not the gold.

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,733
[KOHAKU] Ginro, you need to move
your arms, not your mouth!

15
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:48,442
[CHROME]
So, I meant to ask you,

16
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,608
why are we only making
a silver spear?

17
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,858
[SENKU] Easy, because it's
essential to our quest

18
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:55,150
to acquire the most
dangerous material.

19
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,525
[CHROME, SUIKA]
Huh?

20
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:58,775
[gasps]

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,983
So shiny! So awesome!

22
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,567
Thank you, Senku!
I love my silver spear!

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,567
[KINRO]
Hmph.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,775
[SENKU chuckles]

25
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,025
[SENKU] You don't have
to flap your gums

26
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,442
one millimeter to thank me.

27
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,942
The fact is, I didn't
make that for you.

28
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,358
Come on, we need to get moving.

29
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,192
Ginro, your job today is to
be the team's bodyguard.

30
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:22,150
[GINRO gasps]

31
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,067
[GINRO]
I'm Ginro the bodyguard!

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm guarding the bodies!
You're not gonna get past me!

33
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:28,275
I'm Ginro the...

34
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,858
[KOHAKU]
Wait a sec.

35
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:32,358
I come here all the time to get
water from these hot springs.

36
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,900
[CHROME]
Yeah, what's the deal?

37
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,317
I thought this was supposed to
be a mega-dangerous mission.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,733
[SENKU]
It gets dangerous up ahead.

39
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,483
Ginro, quit messing around

40
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,942
and hold your spear steady
and pointing forward!

41
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,233
This silver spear
acts as a sensor.

42
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,692
That's the whole reason I
made it in the first place.

43
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,192
Pay close attention
to the tip of it.

44
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,775
It's very important.

45
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:55,400
You'll need to notice if that
silver begins to turn black.

46
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,733
Turns black? What do you mean?

47
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:02,233
If that happens, you'll
be dead in seconds.

48
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:03,525
I'm not joking.

49
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,358
[wheezes]

50
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:08,442
That turns black, you need
to get away in .1 seconds.

51
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11,025
That's the signal for all
of us to start running.

52
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,983
The enemy you're
guarding us from

53
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,817
will kill us if we make
just one mistake.

54
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,233
It's the greatest hurdle
in making sulfa drugs.

55
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:20,400
We could die very easily.

56
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,108
It looks to me like
there isn't even

57
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:01,900
a single fish in this river.

58
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,067
[SENKU]
You're right.

59
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,650
Nothing but green
chatsubomi-goke moss.

60
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,317
This is it for sure.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,275
Our goal's just
upstream from here.

62
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,525
So it's coming up.

63
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,650
That "greatest hurdle"
you mentioned before.

64
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,192

Hey! What the hell, man?

72
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,983
You're holding the sensor, so
you need to be in front of us!

73
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,775
Well, you told me that I was
gonna die, so I'm terrified!

You wimp.

75
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,025
Then switch places with me
and hand over the silver spear.

We've finally arrived
at the source

of our most killer
component for the drug.

what it is

we're supposed to
be gathering here.

where you'd find
something important.

Is this not it, or what?

00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,483
No, this is it.
There's no doubt.

This green water is exactly
the stuff we're after.

But the geography bugs me.

The poison gases that form here,

00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,858
the hydrogen sulfide
and sulfur dioxide,

102
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,358
are heavier than air.

They settle in low
spots like this one.

I get it now!

That's what the silver spear's
supposed to warn us about!

with hydrogen sulfide.

going on with the water here?

120
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,942
[SENKU] It's got something that
was discovered by an alchemist

121
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,567
way back in the eighth century.

122
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,733
But during my time,
it served as the foundation

123
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:27,900
for a wide variety of
chemical industries.

[SENKU]
Sulfuric acid.

125
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,775
[CHROME] And we can't make
the medicine for Ruri

126
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,483
without this dangerous stuff?

127
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,817
[SENKU]
Not only that,

128
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,275
we're gonna need it for
all types of chemistry.

129
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,067
It's essential for
further advancement.

130
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,025
Well, then, we'll have to
brute force our way through

131
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,525
to gather some.

132
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,525
I'm not afraid to risk my life
if it'll save my sister's.

133
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,733
I should be fast enough to--

134
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:58,983
Here's a story from
back in my day.

135
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,942
There was a research
group that went to an area

136
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:03,650
of sulfuric acid like that one.

137
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,275
The man in front knelt
down for a moment,

138
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:08,900
probably just tying his shoes.

139
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,567
Professor? Is something
the matter?

140
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,067
The poor guy was dead.

141
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,858
He'd knelt right into
an invisible cloud

142
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,692
of hydrogen sulfide.

143
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:25,067
It sounds crazy, but it's true.

144
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,525
Humans don't stand a chance

145
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,233
when Mother Nature
wants us dead.

146
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:33,025
You can be ridiculously fast,
but it won't make a difference.

147
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,483
So what in the hell are
we supposed to do, Senku?

148
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,900
I have to save Ruri,
no matter what!

149
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,358
There's still a way
for us to do this.

150
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:45,525
I know just the thing.
We'll make gas masks.

151
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,733
The only way to fight
a chemical enemy

152
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:51,650
is by using some
chemistry of our own.

153
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,525
Heh.

154
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:56,817
Now, there's no telling how
effective this is gonna be.

155
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,983
And with this experiment,

156
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,775
we can't simply rely
on trial and error.

157
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,525
Because error equals death.

158
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,942
All right, we gotta
make my mask next.

159
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,233
You won't be needing
one of these.

[SENKU]
Sorry, Chrome,

161
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,317
but you won't be going
on this mission anymore.

162
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,608
You'll be staying here.

163
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,858
What? Where's this coming fr--?

164
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,775
Just shut up and listen to me!

165
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:25,442
There's no guarantee
these things'll work.

166
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,650
And if all our scientists
bite the big one,

167
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,192
then who's gonna be
left to save Ruri?

168

[SENKU]
Every human dies eventually,

169
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,442
but their knowledge
can go on living.

170
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:41,442
It can even be passed down
for millions of years.

171
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,650
I hope you're ready, Chrome.

172
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:47,192
Because I'm gonna pass all the
science I know down to you--

173
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,692
all two million years of it.

174
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,733
[CHROME] Whoa! Wait, wait,
wait, hang on, would ya?

175
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:58,650
It's too soon! Quit talking like
I'm replacing you or something!

176
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,233
That's just asking for trouble!

177
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:03,733
[SENKU] Heh. Well, isn't that
sweet? You really care about me.

178
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,483
What are you, my girlfriend?

179
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,067
Dying doesn't interest me one
millimeter, so calm down.

180
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,900
But if we don't
want Ruri to die,

181
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,567
we gotta go through that
cloud of poison gas

182
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,525
and get us some sulfuric acid.

183
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,733
Now, if both of us end up
kicking the bucket together,

184
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:22,692
then in a flash,
all knowledge of science

185
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,358
will disappear from
the face of the Earth.

186
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:33,525
[CHROME] So you want me to stay
behind 'cause you might die.

187
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:37,150
Yeah, but first I gotta
fill your head with science.

188
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,692
If that's the case,
I'm not gonna listen to you!

[gasps]

[SENKU]
Stop acting like a kid.

191
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,692
Don't get fussy 'cause
you gotta stay home.

192
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,400
You're missing the point!

193
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,942
I won't be helping you
with your crappy plan.

194
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:56,192
Especially not if it means
that it's just okay

195
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:58,650
for my friend to die!

196
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,650
Sorry to disappoint you, Senku,

197
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,775
but I'm not taking
your knowledge.

198
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,858
So if you happen
to croak out there,

199
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,733
it's just gonna be
game over for science!

200
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,775
You're coming back alive!

201
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:15,233
There's a ten billion percent
chance! You have to, Senku!

202
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,692
I mean, the plan doesn't
make sense anyway.

203
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,900
Why's the guy who knows
everything about science

204
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,483
the one risking his life
with that poison gas?

205
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,942
Send me or somebody else!

206
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,150
After all, I thought you
always went with

207
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,150
what's the most "logical."

208
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:32,192
Well, making me stay back
here isn't logical at all.

209
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,275
Are you just trying
to protect me?

00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,442
Like I'm your kid or something?

Don't you dare
patronize me, asshole.

I'm not patronizing
anyone, idiot.

214
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:47,275
Also, I'm being
completely logical.

215
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,858
I know everything about
how the gas mask works

216
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,067
and about the materials
we're going to get,

217
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,067
so our odds of success
are best if I handle this.

218
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,150
End of story.

219
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,275
[CHROME]
You want to increase our odds?

220
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,233
That's not how you do it!

221
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:03,525
We'll have a better chance for
success if you and I tag team.

222
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:06,192
To save each other
if we run into trouble.

[SENKU chuckles]

225
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,067
If we "run into trouble," we'll
be dead from the poison gas.

226
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,025
It'll be too late
to save each other.

227
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,567
Well, I mean something like,

228
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,900
"Shit, I'm getting a killer
leg cramp!" type situation,

229
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,525

Heh. Guess you do have a point.

231
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,650
It might be by a
microscopic percent,

232
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,400
but it would raise
my chance of survival.

00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:35,233
Taiju and Yuzuriha,
your friends...

234
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,233
They're spies in the
Tsukasa Empire, right?

235
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,650
They're putting everything
on the line, ya know?

236
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,275
Your lives are in
each other's hands.

If I'm your friend,

238
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,567
it means I'm not higher
or lower than you.

239
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,692
So I don't need you
to protect me...

...'cause I've got your back,
and you've got mine, right?

Man, this means
more work for us

make another gas mask.

Okay. I've got your
back, Chrome.

That's right. And your
life's in my hands.

248
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,400
[RURI] Kohaku, now that
Mother's no longer with us,

249
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,650
we need to have a crucial talk.

00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,025
The priestess's most
important duty.

Do you know what that is?

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,067
"The Hundred Tales."

253
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,067
The knowledge contained
within those stories

254
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,983
must be passed down from
generation to generation.

255
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:35,025
Our way of life would not
survive without them.

256
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,817
Understand, Kohaku?

257
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,483
Ruri's days on this Earth
are dwindling rapidly.

258
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:45,317
We cannot afford to let the
"Hundred Tales" be lost forever.

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,567
You're in perfect health.

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,817
When Ruri dies,
you must take her place!

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,358
[KOHAKU]
I refuse to accept that!

262

I won't be taking over anything!

00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,400
Wha--?

264
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,608
I have no intention
of being a part of this.

265
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:56,858
Not if it means that afterwards,

266
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,983
it's just okay for
my sister to die!

267
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,400
[KOKUYO]
Where are you going, Kohaku?

268
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:08,442
[KOHAKU] If I'm in a position to
take over the role of priestess,

269
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,275
Ruri will have no
reason to keep living.

270
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,733
I know what to do!

271
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,192
I'll just have to make
Father hate me.

272
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,067
I'll be the wild daughter.

273

Someone utterly unfit
to become the priestess.

274
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,025
But I won't stop carrying
this healing water,

275
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,525
even if I have to do
it thousands of times.

276
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:30,400
If that's what it's gonna take
to cure Ruri, I'll do it!

277
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:37,233
Ya know, you and I are more
alike than you'd think.

278
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:40,942
And to be honest, if my sister
were to marry a man like you,

279
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:44,525
it would make everyone in
the village really happy.

280
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,150
But unfortunately,
you weren't blessed

with the ability to fight.

I suppose the gods aren't
very considerate, huh?

283
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,067
If everything goes
according to our plan,

284
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,025
Ruri will be marrying
either Kinro or Ginro.

285
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,233
So how 'bout this?

286
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,692
She and I do look alike--

287
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,442
would you like me to be
your wife as consolation?

You're nothing like her.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

297
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,525
So don't say crazy
stuff like that.

298
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,608
[SENKU] This is a lot like when
we made Edison's light bulb.

299
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,942
First, we steam-roast
some bamboo.

300
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,900
[CHROME] Whoa. You can really
use glass to start a fire?

301
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,650
[SENKU] Add potassium carbonate,
extracted from ash.

302
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,233
We also used this
in our ramen-making.

303
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,733
[SENKU] This black powder
is activated charcoal

304
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,567
mixed with potassium carbonate.

305
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,692
It'll trap the poison
gas and neutralize it.

306
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,608
[CHROME] Now we have our
own chemical barrier

307
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,942
to keep out poison gas.

308
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,233
[CHROME]
Time for us scientists to return

309
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,275
for a tag team rematch!

310
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:03,817
[SENKU chuckles]

311
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,025
[SENKU] We're gonna get over
the greatest hurdle together.

312
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:10,567
We'll come home victorious,
carrying jars of sulfuric acid.

313
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,108
I won't go!

314
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,025
The fairy of the spring
put a curse on me!

315
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,817
My silver spear turned black!
And that bird melted!

316
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,942
So there is no way that I'm
ever going back there again!

317
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,858
Don't be a baby, Ginro.
Come on, we're going!

318
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,483
Nah. It'd be better
if he just stayed here.

319
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,525
He'd only slow us down.

320
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,650
Listen, what happened at
the spring wasn't a curse.

321
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,567
It's science.

322
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,483
Rub the black sulfuric acid
sludge with an alkaline base

323
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,358
and it'll turn silver again.

324
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,900
Even some warm
ashes'll do the trick.

325
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,817
[CHROME] Ah! The poison
gas sensor's back!

326
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,150
Now we can head back to
the sulfuric acid spring.

327
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,108
The poor guy was dead.

328
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,608
[CHROME]
Literally do or die this time.

329
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,483
[SULFUR LADY screams]

330
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,233
[CHROME] Do we really stand
a chance against this?

331
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:26,025
One breath can mean
instant death.

332
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,108
[CHROME]
Huh? The hell?

333
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,858
Senku, are you seriously
just running up to it?

334
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:33,567
[SENKU] If you stand around
huffing and puffing in fear,

335
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,233
the gas mask won't be able to
keep up with purifying the air.

336
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,483
Tch. It's a ridiculously
simple concept.

337
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,317
Freak out too much and you die.

338
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,150
Got it? Let's go.

339
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,858
[CHROME] Yeah, I understand
the reasoning, but...

340
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:51,442
Damn it. Senku, I'm just
not as ballsy as you are.

341
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,442
[KASEKI]
This is for the birds.

342
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:09,108
I could be doing so
many other things

343
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:11,567
beside sitting here
dealing with this.

344
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,358
[GINRO] Senku and Chrome
have gotta be insane.

345
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:15,567
[KASEKI]
Hm?

346
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,317
I mean, do they not
think that it's scary?

347
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,942
One wrong move and you're dead!

348
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,942
Ya know, I hate it when
people pull that stuff!

349
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,733
Trying to pretend they're brave
when they're just crazy!

350
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,025
So you'd prefer to stay
home and run your mouth

351
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,067
rather than run towards danger.

352
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,775
And I suppose you feel like
a loser compared to them

353
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,733
because you're so weak.

354
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,442
No, I don't.

355
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,358
[KASEKI]
Don't worry, Ginro.

356
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,733
You want my opinion,

357
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,567
I don't think you're
the slightest bit weak.

358
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,942
Fear is the secret
to a long life.

359
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,400
And that should be
pretty convincing,

360
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,483
coming from an old fogy like me.

361
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,108
I used to be a real wimp.

362
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,858
And I guarantee you,
those boys are scared, too.

363
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:58,608
There's not a soul out there
that's immune to fear.

364
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,900
[GINRO] Oh, yeah. I hadn't
thought about it before.

365
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:08,317
I can only imagine how
terrifying it must be for Kinro,

366
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,858
with his fuzzy eyes,
to go up against Magma.

367
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,608
[KASEKI] But for the sake of
something precious to us,

368
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:16,733
we try to overcome our fear,

369
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,275
using our brains
and a lot of heart.

370
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,858
That's what they're doing.

371
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,692
Well, at least,
that's my take on it.

372
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:31,817
The only thing I want...
is to save my sister's life.

373
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,858
Oh, dear, it would
seem that I let myself

374
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,817
get a little carried away and
made another one of these.

375
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,067
Guess I should
just leave it here.

376
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,400
Don't really have a use for it.

377
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,150
[gasps]

378
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,400
[CHROME]
Senku!

379
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:07,192
The hose on your
gas mask is melting

380
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,775
and it's about to bust open!

381
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:10,858
[SENKU chuckles]

382
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:11,983
[SENKU]
That was close.

383
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,108
Good thing we came
out here as a team.

384
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,400
[CHROME]
This is bad. Like, actually bad.

385
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,525
Senku's trying like crazy
to catch up to me.

386
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,817
Don't bother, man.
There's no chance in hell.

387
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,442
Damn it! It was
such a tiny misstep.

388
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,233
I hope they can at
least still save Ruri.

389
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,983
[GINRO yells]

390
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,733
[gasps]

391
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,275
[SENKU, CHROME]
Ginro?

392
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:52,858
[SULFUR LADY screaming]

393
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,942
[GINRO]
You're too heavy!

394
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,108
[SENKU] You gotta control
your breathing, Ginro!

395
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,233
Your gas mask can't
keep up with you!

396
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:04,692
[GINRO] It can't? Is the
poison gas going to kill me?

397
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:07,317
Am I going to die right now?

398
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,025
[SULFUR LADY snarling]

399
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:11,358
[SENKU] The activated charcoal
and potassium carbonate

400
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,067
will keep you safe, I swear!

401
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,275
But only if you
control your breath!

402
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,525
I know that you can
overcome your fear!

403
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,733
That's how you got out this far
in the first place, isn't it?

404
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:27,483
[CHROME] Yo, Ginro. Listen
to this and think with this.

405
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,900
No matter how powerful
nature may be,

406
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,567
it doesn't have a
heart to listen to

407
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,858
or a brain to reason with.

408
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,567
But humans are different.

409
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,067
That's all we've
got going for us!

410
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:42,692
[GINRO]
Right. I'm Ginro the bodyguard.

411
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,400
[SULFUR LADY screams]

412
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:48,192
[GINRO] I'll overcome my fear
with my head and my heart.

413
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:54,150
[GINRO yells]

414

[screaming]

415
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:11,400
We've got a bad tag team with
me and Senku, the scientists...

416
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:13,608
...and me, the bodyguard.

417
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,942
Together, we overcame
the greatest hurdle so far.

418
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,692
Sulfuric acid acquired!

419
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:21,567
[CHROME, GINRO]
Yeah!
