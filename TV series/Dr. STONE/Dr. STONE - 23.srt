1
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:16,775
[SUIKA] Whoa! You can
see super far away!

2
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,108
[SUIKA gasps]

3
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,400
[SUIKA] The sun's coming up
really soon, you guys!

4
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:23,650
Careful not to look at it
through the telescope.

5
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,067
If those are the
right type of stones,

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,942
they should start to glow.

7
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,692
[ALL gasp]

8
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,358
Oh, wow. It looks like
a mountain of jewels.

9
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:36,817
Yeah, of course it does.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,567
Because it is a
mountain of jewels.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,108
[SENKU chuckles]

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,275
And this treasure hoard here

13
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,692
has our ultra-rare
metal inside it!

14
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,608
Ha. Call 'em whatever you want--

15
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:49,108
they're just kinda
heavy rocks to me.

16
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:51,025
I hope they're worth the fuss.

17
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:54,358
They'll definitely be worth it
when they help us beat Tsukasa.

18
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,608
These'll help us win the battle?

19
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,358
I get it.

20
00:00:58,442 --> 00:00:59,775
They're weapons!

21
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:02,358
They've got enough weight to 'em
to really hurt somebody!

22
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,150
Sorry, Father. I don't
think that's what they--

23
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,733
Cut him some slack.

24
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,108
The older generation doesn't
understand some things.

25
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,400
[KOKUYO]
Huh?!

26
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,525
Look, we're up against
Tsukasa's army,

27
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,025
which is gonna be
crazy ong-stray.

28
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,150
But if we stick to the plan

29
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,192
and make cell phones
with these rocks,

30
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:20,400
we'll have a massive advantage
in the information war.

31
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,233
[KOHAKU] Yeah, I know,
but how much longer

32
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,525
is it going to take to
make these cell phones?

33
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,775
[GINRO] That's a good question,
'cause once spring comes,

34
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:28,733
their army's gonna
storm the village!

35
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:31,650
Ehh. We're not far
from our goal.

36
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,442
To explain things simply,

37
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,733
the vacuum tube's the heart
of the cell phone,

38
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:39,275
plastic's the skeleton, the
microphone's the vocal cord,

39
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:41,317
and the gold wire's the veins.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,150
All we gotta do is put
those four parts together

41
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,150
and we'll have ourselves
a cell phone.

42
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,775
[OTHERS gasp]

43
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,525
[SENKU] It's been a marathon
of a science project,

44
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:54,317
but we're getting close
to the finish line.

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,275
Ha! Now it's time for us to make
our final sprint to the end!

46
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,192
The first thing we gotta
do is make filaments,l

47
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:40,025
which are essential
for vacuum tubes.

48
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,525
And they'll be made
outta tungsten.

49
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,317
The most heat-resistant metal
in the known universe

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,442
waiting inside this blue light.

51
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,025
Here's another question:

52
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:51,650
How exactly are we gonna
get it out of the stone?

53
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,900
Yeah, well, that is gonna
be pretty tough to pull off.

54
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:58,275
What the hell are you
doing?! Are you crazy?!

55
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:01,067
Huh? We're gettin' the stuff
outta these rocks, man.

56
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,775
If we smash 'em up first,
it'll be easy.

57
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,483
That totally works for me.

58
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,525
We'll be turning it
into powder, anyway.

59
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,400
You guys hear that?
What'd I tell ya?

60
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,358
[GINRO]
Uh! But you didn't know that!

61
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,608
[KOHAKU]
If you were wrong,

62
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,650
you'd have to go through
all that trouble again!

63
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,817
[KOKUYO]
Well, this is strange.

64
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,483
This isn't like him at all.

65
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,442
I've never actually seen
him offer to help before.

66
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:26,025
Did something happen
down in that cave?

67
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,525
[SENKU]
With me here, you get to see

68
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:29,400
all the ridiculously
awesome stuff

69
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:33,150
that humanity worked together
for two million years to build.

70
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:37,108
And I'll show you enough
to make your head spin.

71
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,650
Senku!

72
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,983
I don't care if you're
in charge anymore.

73
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:44,983
At least, not until we deal
with that Tsukasa guy.

74
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:48,525
Huh. Wonder what it was.

75
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,317
[MAGMA]
All done! So what's next?

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,067
I'll use my chemistry skills
on this powdered rock.

77
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,400
And when I'm finished with it,

78
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,067
it should have a similar
consistency to toothpaste.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,942
Oh, right, more fun
chemistry stuff.

80
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,858
Never does me any good to
ask questions about it.

81
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,317
[SENKU] Then, we're gonna treat
the toothpaste with hydrogen

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,108
by warming it up in
a glass container

83
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,817
to get rid of any rust.

84
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,733
And we're done.

85
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,608
It has to reach a
thousand degrees,

86
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:13,817
but the hotter we make it,

87
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,067
the stronger the
tungsten'll turn out.

88
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,317
Ho-ho! We can just throw it
in our trusty furnace here!

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,817
It's nice to get an easy
step once in a while.

90
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,858
Have you two lost your minds?

91
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,608
Think what would happen
to a glass container

92
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,442
if you threw it into a
thousand-degree fire.

93
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,650
[BOTH gasp]

94
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,150
We have to make sure that
only the tungsten mixture

95
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,858
inside of the glass
container is getting hot.

96
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,900
So then we'll need to pinpoint
the heat on one spot.

97
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,150
But how exactly?

98
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,733
Let's split up the work--
time is short.

99
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,608
I can handle all of
the toothpaste-making

100
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,025
chemistry stuff.

101
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,817
Wait, then who's
gonna figure out

102
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,692
the pinpoint heating mechanism?

103
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:53,025
We don't have another scientist!

104
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,900
[gasps]

105
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,400
Come on.

106
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:03,025
You know everything you
need to make that happen.

107
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,608
You've gotta throw all
the science tricks

108
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:05,942
you've learned at it.

109
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,483
Heh.

110
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,817
Or do you need Professor Senku
to come and hold your hand?

111
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,400
Are you kidding with that?
Don't make me laugh.

112
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,192
I'm Chrome, you know!

113
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,858
And I'm smarter than hell!
I'm a scientist!

114
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,317
If you need some
help in your lab,

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,983
you'd better not come crying
about it to me, okay?

116
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,358
[SENKU] I got all the
lab stuff, no problem.

117
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:30,733
You're gonna have your hands
full leading the heating team.

118
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:36,275
You guys make me
a little jealous.

119
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,942
Since I was a boy, I've
always loved making things.

120
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:47,150
It was such a fun way
to spend my time.

121
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:51,483
I made all kinds of stuff,
like shields and bridges,

122
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,108
while other people just
stood back and stared.

123
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:55,275
Even in my old age,

124
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:59,775
I still get looked
at as a laborer.

125
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:02,567
Seeing you two working
together like this

126
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,275
has got me thinking
about how much

127
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,150
I'd like to have a crafting
buddy of my own.

128
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,733
[CHROME]
Hm?

129
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:11,650
But you're not building things
on your own anymore, are you?

130
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,233
You've got crafting buddies.

131
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:17,692
Hold on, I do? Who's that?

132
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:21,150
Us two.

133
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:26,983
Really?

134
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,358
Even though I'm almost 50
years older than you?

135
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,983
Of course. Why should age
matter at all? Who cares?

136
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,567

[SENKU, CHROME scream]

138
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,150
[SENKU]
What the hell?

139
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:09,858
I've gotta say,
he certainly is gung-ho.

140
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,650
[SENKU] All right, modern man,
you're comin' with me.

141
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,817
I'll bet you know a little more
chemistry than the villagers.

142
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,358
I'm not so sure.

143
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,358
There are a stupid
number of steps,

144
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:22,108
so this could get
pretty complicated,

145
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:24,275
but I'll try to keep it simple.

146
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,150
Cook the powder in
sodium hydroxide,

147
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,775
add seashells,
hydrochloric acid,

148
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,858
and ammonia to crystallize it,
then bake it and mix with honey.

149
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,442
[gasps]

150
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:36,567
Yeah, okay, and I am reading you
loud and clear Professor Senku!

151
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,442
I'm using honey! Bake it
and add some honey.

152
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,900
That's about the gist
of it, that right?

153
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,650
[SENKU] Chrome would
be ten billion times

154
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,108
more helpful right now.

[GEN] No, I doubt anyone
could've kept up with all that.

156
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,733
You're the only person
who understands

this kind of stuff you know.

158
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,233
Look!

159
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,025
This has gotta be the perfect
tool for precision heating!

160
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,692
Ha! Chrome is pulling out
his special move again!

161
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,233
Quit showin' off.

162
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,942
That thing brings
back bad memories.

163
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,858
I'm not exactly
sure how much heat

164
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,775
that lens is going to produce.

165
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,317
To test out the temperature,

166
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I've set up these metals
by heat resistance.

167
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,942
[SUIKA] It doesn't seem to be
doing anything to the lead,

168
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,150
and that's the
weakest one, right?

169
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,192
Maybe because it's winter.

170
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:34,233
It might work if we had
a little more sunlight.

171
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,317
You've gotta throw all
the science tricks

172
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,733
you've learned at it.

173
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,317
[gasps]

174
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,483
Our pinpoint heater needs fire.
And the cotton candy machine.

175
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,483
Let's throw that in, too!

176
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,567
Aw, man!

177
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,650
We're gonna need more
than just me and Suika.

178
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:54,150
But at least the lead's
startin' to melt down!

179
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:57,150
Awesome! There goes the
gold and silver, too!

180
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,317
Yeah! Way to go, battle team!

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,108
[MAGMA, KOHAKU yelling]

182
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,692
Iron is down!

183
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,942
Yeah! Gorilla team!

184
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,025
[KASEKI laughs]

185
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,067
We made it past a
thousand degrees!

186
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,942
It has to reach a
thousand degrees,

187
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,192
but the hotter we make it,

188
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,567
the stronger the
tungsten'll turn out.

189
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,358
We need more heat.

190
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,858
Let's throw in electricity!

191
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,942
[SENKU]
All right. It's finally done.

192
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,567
Tungsten toothpaste acquired!

193
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,900
So, heating team,
how's it goin'?

194
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:34,067
Great. We're just
about done here.

195
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,525
Huh? Not too shabby,
ya science user.

196
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:38,858
[SENKU screams]

197
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,692
What's with the jumbo
deluxe combo set?!

198
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,483
Come on, Senku. I'm doing
exactly what you told me.

199
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,983
Using every trick I've learned.

200
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,900
I didn't mean to go this far.
The thing's ugly as hell.

201
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,650
[chuckles]

202
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,817
[SENKU]
But to be honest,

203
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,067
this might actually be
the best solution.

204
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,525
So now, everybody's gonna
need to work together

205
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,692
to get this temperature
crazy high.

206
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,567
We're gonna squeeze out
a long, thin blob

207
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,233
of tungsten toothpaste.

208
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,942
Zapping water with electricity
produces hydrogen.

209
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,317
The hydrogen, with tons of heat,

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,608
will peel the rust
right off that stuff.

211
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,067
Here we go.
Few thousand degrees.

212
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,858
[ALL]
Let's heat this thing up!

213
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,483
[VILLAGERS gasping]

214
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:38,400
We've tamed the world's
most heat-resistant metal.

215
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:42,067
Which means now we have our
hands on tungsten filament!

216
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:52,400
[SENKU] With this, we have
everything that we need.

217
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:56,483
Aw, yeah! We're so close to
the finish I can taste it!

218
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,442
We might as well go in order!

219
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,483
I think we should start with
the cell phone's heart

220
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,900
and finish makin'
the darn vacuum tube.

221
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,817
But to get that part done,

222
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,233
it's gonna take some pretty
complicated glasswork.

223
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,608
I'm not entirely sure that
you're up to it, old man.

224
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,900
Oh, please.
Give me some credit.

225
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,067
I did make this ridiculously
challenging twisty doohickey

226
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,650
for ya earlier, didn't I?

227
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,692
So nothin' scares me now!

228
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,358
Well? Let me see
what you've got.

229
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,983
[yelps]

230
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,358
This device is known
as a Hickman pump.

231
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:31,233
It sucks air like you
wouldn't believe.

232
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,733
This baby is a level
ten billion vacuum!

233
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,192
You kinda sound
like you're doing

234
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,275
a vacuum cleaner commercial.

235
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,567
[SENKU]
Vacuum tubes are created

236
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,942
by removing as much air
inside as possible.

237
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,983
The pump we built before was
more like a level one prototype,

238
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,817
which worked for light bulbs.

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,317
But it won't give us enough
power for this job.

240
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,275
I don't know where to begin.
Is this even humanly possible?

241
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,067
In Senku's and my age,
people could build them,

242
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,442
but it was only the insanely
talented super craftsmen guys.

243
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,942
I know you're good, Kaseki,

244
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,525
but this is a different
era altogether,

245
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,567
so you shouldn't feel
too bad about it.

246
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,442
It'll never ork-way.

247
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:10,400
Is that true?

248
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,525
Well, yeah.

249
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,108
But why the hell
would a mentalist

250
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,692
know the first thing about it?

251
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,858
He's probably just
talking out of his ass

[KASEKI] It's fine. I don't
need you to inspire me.

It's the complicated stuff
that gets me fired up, anyway.

But in exchange... A favor.

257
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,858
That thing you did with Chrome,

258
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,567
I really want you to
do it with me, too.

259
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,858
You know. Seeing as the
two of us are buddies.

I'm sure I'm the only
one who noticed,

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,233
but even though Old Man Kaseki's
acting like a little kid

267

begging for that high five,
he's really more concerned

And we'll do it without
any help from Senku!

00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,150
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:49,025
All right. Are you ready,

281
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,608
Because it's time for us
to make some plastic.

282
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,150
Yep!

283

I have no clue what that is
exactly, but I'm ready to learn!

Honestly, this is the
step on the road map

285
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,983
I was the most worried about.

286
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,567
Is it even possible to make
plastic in the Stone World?

287
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,150
I'm just saying, isn't it
made outta petroleum? Uh.

288
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,400
[KASEKI] Get over here,
Gen. You're with me.

289
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,108
You got me so fired up earlier

to work you to death!

[SENKU]
Uhh...

00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,108
Who woulda thunk it?

The old guy's got a
soft spot for Gen.

295
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,108
For some reason.

296
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,942
[SENKU] I figured out
how to make our plastic.

297
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,733
First, we wanna simmer some wood

298
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,692
and boil the liquid
that comes out.

299
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,900
Pour that over some hot
copper, and then--

300
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,775
Hold on a second, Senku!
I'm already completely lost!

301
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,567
You heat it to extract some
liquid, heat that again,

302
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,108
and then heat that again?

303
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,983
What are we even doing?

304
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,650
We're modding the hell
out of it by adding

305
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,983
and removing crucial
ingredients.

306
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,525
Chemistry's all about
adding and subtracting.

307
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,775
And after that process,

308
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:55,192
we're left with this
stuff called formalin.

309
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,150
You can preserve
corpses with it.

310
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,525
[CHROME]
That stinks!

311
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,025

all the time?

313
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,567
Okay.

314
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,233
So now the only thing we need to
acquire is a ton of coal ash.

315
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:07,525
Because sodium hydroxide

316
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:10,067
plus formalin plus coal
ash makes bakelite,

317
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,567
which is the very first
man-made plastic.

318
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,108
It's perfect for this.

319
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,317
Oh, okay.

320
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,108
So I guess we're
gonna need to burn

321
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,483
a crazy amount of
coal, aren't we?

322
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,608
My hands are numb.

323
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,150
We're not gonna get much
work done like this.

324
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:29,067
This winter does seem like
an especially harsh one.

325
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm worried some poor soul

326
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:33,358
is going to die from
the cold this year.

327
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:37,483
We need coal?

328
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,275
[SENKU] Yeah, like a
ridiculous amount of it.

329
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,650
It seems like just
the job for you guys.

330
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,358
Hold on, Ginro.
Where you going?

331
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:48,192
Oh, you know me! Off to train.

332
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,692
And I have to guard the village,

333
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,192
so I don't really have the
time to take this on, too.

334
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,942
I'll have to pass. Shucks.

335
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,150
The rules are the rules.

336
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,483
And the village chief's
orders are absolute.

337
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:04,608
Let me go, please!
This is gonna be so hard!

338
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,983
[KINRO]
I said, "Rules are rules"!

339
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:20,858
[KIDS gasp]

340
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,733
This thing makes the house
super warm and toasty!

341
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:26,942
We should make a nice
hot meal for everybody to eat.

342
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,650
[NATORI]
Mh-hm!

343
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:32,858
We have the time, since
the work's going faster.

344
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,317
[SENKU] Now then, the only
thing that we really need

345
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
are the ashes from the coal.

346
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:40,358
But you're more than welcome
to sit by the fire.

347
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,525
I'm impressed, Senku.

348
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,733
Huh?

349
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,942
I realize that the
things you're making

350
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,442
are for a completely
separate goal,

351
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,650
but our little village
is slowly becoming

352
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,400
a much better place to live.

353
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:01,400
It's true. That's
how science works.

354
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,733
It's just as simple as that.

355
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,608
[KOKUYO]
I must say,

356
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,900
you ended up being just
the man we needed

357
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,858
to lead our village
into the future.

358
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,192
Hold on. Zinc-carbon batteries?

359
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,400
Are we gonna use batteries
to finish the vacuum tubes?

360
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:35,733
The instructions and materials
are all listed there.

361
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:37,692
We'll use the manganese
from the caves.

362
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,650
Uh...

363
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,317
So you want me to
make them, do you?

364
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,983
[sighs]

365
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,067
We'll need 800, at the least.

366
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,525
Huh?! Are you crazy?!

367
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,483
Utal-bray.

368
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,483
I can lend a hand! No problem!

369
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,733
[thud]

370
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,692
Here's the wine
that you asked for.

371
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,567
You throwin' a party, or what?

372
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,150
Nuh-uh. Makin' some microphones.
They're the vocal cord.

373
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,400
Huh? Out of wine?

374
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,817
Yeah.

375
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,733
More precisely... we'll be
using these pink crystals

376
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,067
that are stuck all
over the lid here.

377
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,150
Then we'll cook some
of this seaweed,

378
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,733
mix it into hot water, and done.

379
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,317
Huh?! Which part of this stuff

380
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,275
is the gonna be the
"microphone" thingy?

381
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,150
Dunno, and what are all those
shiny rocks in there?

382
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,358
[SENKU]
They're Rochelle salts

383
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:01,150
and they turn sound
into electricity.

384
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,483
You can tack one of these
onto something lightweight,

385
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,858
like a plastic megaphone
for example,

386
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,400
and you've got yourself
a microphone.

387
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:14,150
The plastic hurdle's cleared!

388
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,650
The wire hurdle's cleared!

389
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,400
Vacuum tube hurdle's cleared!

390
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,650
Microphone's cleared!

391
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:33,067
[SENKU] The most powerful
weapon of modern warfare

392
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,483
is one that shoots voices
over infinite distances.

393
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,900
It's the birth of
the cell phone.

394
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,942
Oh, yeah!

395
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,150
[BOTH gasp]

396
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,108
Whoa!

397
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:50,983
[KASEKI laughs]

398
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,192
Yay!

399
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:54,608
[GEN chuckles]

400
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,858
So bad!

401
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,442
[chuckles]

402
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,900
And we were able to pull this
thing off before spring came.

403
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,983
[SENKU] The final battle
is coming soon.

404
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,442
We're up against Tsukasa,

405
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,775
so get ready, everyone.

406
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:23,400
[SENKU]
And of course, get excited.
