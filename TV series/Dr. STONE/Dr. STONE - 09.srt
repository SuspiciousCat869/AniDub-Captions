[SENKU] This savory bowl

Foxtail millet ramen. Coming up!

Besides, a guard

Heh. They can have

that the more ramen they eat,

the harder I'm gonna work 'em!

But you know that, right, Senku?

[KOHAKU] He's definitely
with that long-haired man!

Should I kill him?

Wait, you fool.

Okay, Gen.

You ten billion percent knew
I was trying to make you talk,

so why'd you
suddenly let it slip

00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,525
that you're working
with Tsukasa?

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,150
Well, because once
I saw all of this,

"Tsukasa, Senku
is still alive."

One little phrase, and your
fate would be sealed.

That was my initial plan.

you doing that.

Give me a life
surrounded by hot girls

I couldn't care less if you
and that primate Tsukasa

live or die.

142

I'll be on the winning side,
no matter what I have to do.

143
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,067
What benefits me most?

144
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,608
Is it aligning with your
fledgling Kingdom of Science,

145
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,483
or perhaps Tsukasa's
Empire of Strength?

146
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,733
That is truly the
extent of my concern.

147
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,150
On one hand,

148
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,775
there's the scientific creations
and ramen and all that.

149
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:03,400
But hellish, back-breaking
work is just not my style.

150
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:06,275
On the other hand, Tsukasa's
settlement lacks science

151
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,942
and the food is rather plain.

152
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,775
But my work is easy.

153
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,442
And if I revive
a few hot celebs,

154
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,108
I could have the
harem of my dreams.

155
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:15,733
A harem? What's that?

156
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:19,317
I'm sorry. All I can say is
that it's not for children.

157
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,567
[SUIKA] Well, whatever it is,
ramen is probably way better!

158
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,317
Yeah. Ramen's nice, but
on a balmy day like this,

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,858
I think I'd rather side with
Tsukasa and what he can provide.

160
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,692
Asagiri Gen, was it?

161
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:35,358
I think the only two options for
a snake in the grass like you

162
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,567
are either locked up
or put in the ground!

163
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,775
Scary!

164
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:39,983
No.

165
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,483
If he doesn't go back
and give his report,

166
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,067
Tsukasa will come
looking for him

167
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,942
and we'll all be screwed.

168
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,192
[chuckles]

169
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:52,608
So relax, would you?
I've got a plan for this iron.

170
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,483
And once you feast your eyes on
what we're gonna make with it,

171
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,733
there's a ten billion percent
chance you'll choose

172
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,983
to join our Kingdom of Science.

173
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:04,025
Oh? What's that? Think you
can sway me with a sword?

174
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,025
How 'bout a generator?

175
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:13,233
A generator? Are you
freakin' kidding me?

176
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:15,317
No way you could pull that off!

177
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,692
[SENKU]
Nice, you have native copper.

178
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,567
[CHROME] Hey, that stuff's
way too pretty to destroy.

179
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,108
We'll melt it to make wire.

180
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,942
[CHROME] Damnit,
you're not even listening.

181
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:27,733
Now then, if only we
could get some lightning.

182
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:37,733
[JASPER] It's lightning,
the rage of the heavens!

183
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,608
[ARGO]
If it hits you, you're dead!

184
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:42,150
Make sure the women
and children are safe!

185
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,108
[JASPER]
Move! Quickly!

186
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,150
Looks like we're getting
our lightning.

187
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,400
Ha! It is the rainy
season, after all.

188
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:50,567
Ah! Can you believe
how lucky we are?

189
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,192
This isn't luck, it's
the worst-case scenario!

190
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:56,108
We are in no way prepared
to utilize this right now!

191
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,233
The generator will
run on lightning?

192
00:10:58,317 --> 00:10:59,733
That's ridiculous.

193
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,108
Yes, of course.

194
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:04,983
Magnets. I can make a
generator if I have magnets.

195
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,733
[SUIKA] But we have the ones
we used to collect the sand.

196
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,608
The natural ones are way
too weak for what we need.

197
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,733
We'll catch lightning
with an iron rod,

198
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:16,275
and make a crazy-strong magnet
using the power of science!

199
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:19,567
I was gonna put up a bunch of
rods, as many as possible,

200
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,817
but we can't pass
up this opportunity.

201
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,275
We'll just have to run
with what we've got!

202
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:30,567
Heh. Pardon the pun, but we
gotta move fast as lightning!

203
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,317
Melt the copper!

204
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,567
There's lacquer coating
Kohaku's shield;

205
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,650
we could really use
some of that!

206
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,358
[SUIKA] I got a whole
jar of it right here!

207
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,317
Lacquer is a ridiculously
effective insulator.

208
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,275
Use it to coat the iron rod.

209
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,233
I'm confused.

210
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:51,317
Uh. I don't think you
should be doing that!

211
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,733
I've carved a channel in it!

212
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,025
[SENKU] Pour the melted
copper into the channel.

213
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,942
And after it solidifies,

214
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:02,775
wrap it up real tight
around the iron bar.

215
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,233
Hey, everybody, listen up!

216
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:07,358
The foreigner and his friends

217
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,400
have started destroying
the bridge!

218
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:14,692
Heh. So he's finally showing us
his true, evil colors, huh?

219
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,525
That's probably why the
gods are so angry with us.

220
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,483
They don't like that sorcery.

221
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,025
Ah, yeah!

222
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,150
All right. Time for them to die.

223
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:27,608
[gasps]

224
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,192
[CHROME]
This is bad! It's Magma!

225
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,483
[KOHAKU] He's not the kinda
guy who talks things over.

226
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,983
We're gonna have to fight!

227
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,192
If we go to war with the village
right now, it's game over!

228
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,400
I need to think fast!

229
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,567
[sighs]

230
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,483
Now this won't do.

231
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:48,067
I simply can't let myself get
killed because of you lot.

232
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,108
Fetch me some flowers, Suika.

233
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,233
Huh?

234
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,358
Instead of war, flowers.

235
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,067
[ALL]
Hm?

236
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,942
[GEN]
Ha!

237
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,567
What in the hell is this
guy holdin' flowers for?

238
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,608
Doesn't he know we're
lookin' for a fight?

239
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:08,942
Yeah!

240
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,358
Were you the one that made
the gods so angry? Heh.

241
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:16,525
Stepping up to me like this
takes more balls than brains.

242
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:20,192
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

243
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,733
We're trying to use our sorcery

244
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,150
to stop this onslaught
of terror from above.

245
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,192
Quit talkin' outta your ass.
I don't wanna hear--

246
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,233
Allow me to show you.

247
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:30,858
[MANTLE, CARBO gasp]

248
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:34,192
They disappeared!
Did you see that?

249
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,233
[KOHAKU]
Wait a second.

250
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:37,400
So they really can't
see the flowers?

251
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,900
[SENKU] It's a trick
that I believe is called

252
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,233
the back palm.

253
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,942
Magicians do it all the
time with cards and stuff.

254
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,025
Hmph.

255
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,775
Not too shabby for
a complete fraud.

256
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,067
[MANTLE screaming]

257
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,233
Heh.

258
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,817
[GEN sighs]

259
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,150
[SENKU] It may sound nuts,
but it's doable.

260
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,692
There was a guy at NASA
called Wasilewski

261
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,900
who ran successful
experiments using lightning

262
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,108
to make powerful magnets.

263
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,483
[WASILEWSKI]
Wasilewski!

264
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,650
I just so happened to
find this bad boy

265
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:24,983
on top of that bald
mountain one day!

266
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,192
Well, Chrome,

267
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,108
I'd say that your ten
years of exploration

268
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,775
are really paying off now.

269
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,608
Oh, yeah. Pretty bad, right?

270
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:34,775
We're at the top of
the bald mountain!

271
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,108
[SENKU]
Perfect spot to catch lightning.

272
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,525
We couldn't ask for
a better place!

273
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,317
Set up the lightning
rod, quickly!

274
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,275
You see that?

275
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:54,733
I think they wanna make
a tower, should we--?

276
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:57,817
No way! You're just after a
silver spear, aren't you?

277
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,817
We came here to keep an eye
on them. Rules are rules, okay?

278
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,525
The lightning's close now.

279
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,817
Crap. There isn't enough time
to build real scaffolding.

280
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,483
Even so, we have to
get as high as we can.

281
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,817
If only there were
something long

282
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,858
that we could stick
into the ground.

283
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,275
[GINRO]
Uh?

284
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:20,692
No! Not happening!
This is my spear!

285
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,817
Guess you like it more
than you let on.

This is crazy, Senku.

00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,733
Starting with nothing
in this barren Stone World.

294
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,900
You actually pulled it off.

Get excited, people.

00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:28,817
Woohoo! We scored a
magnet for our generator!

298
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,650
Oh, no. Was your
golden spear destroyed?

I hope you can
forgive me, Kinro.

But it was kind of an emergency.

I'm sure Senku will make you
another one if you ask him.

Hey, Kinro! Where did that
special spear of yours go?

Gone forever, huh?

304
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,483
And you were so
protective of it, too.

I mean, you never even
let me borrow it once,

it's a real shame.

00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,067
[KOHAKU, CHROME gasp]

316
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,233
[SUIKA]
Wow! They're so strong!

317
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,942
We can make it now, can't we?

318
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,942
That crazy-bad thing
you call electricity?

319
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:28,858
I'm curious, Senku. Are you
creating a thermal generator?

320
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:30,650
Or a wind turbine?

321
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,233
I don't suppose you're
going nuclear yet.

322
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,692
It'll be muscle powered.

323
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,233
I should've expected as much.

324
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,108
We'll hammer the
copper to stretch it,

325
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,067
cut it into a disk,
and grind it down.

326
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:59,317
Yo! Let's try and grind this
disk down with corundum.

327
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,442
It's one of the
baddest rocks I've got!

328
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,900
The second-strongest
mineral after diamond.

329
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,567
I really admire your
collection, Chrome.

330
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,400
I'd thought we'd coat the copper
wire with phosphoric acid,

331
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,983
but this lacquer
oughtta work just fine.

332
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,900
I've been racking my brain

333
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:20,858
trying to come up with
the perfect quip,

334
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,650
but I think I should just ask.

335
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,817
[SENKU]
What?

336
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,775
Why do you look like
a human marshmallow?

337
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,733
Lacquer poisoning.

338
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,275
[banging]

339
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,442
Ah, yeah!

340
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:34,775
[SENKU chuckles]

341
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,525
The Kingdom of Science advances.

342
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,567
[SENKU] Our dual-wield
hand crank generator

343
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,275
is now complete.

344
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,983
So do we need to spin
them both in unison?

345
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,692
That seems pretty challenging.

346
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,692
Not if two of us work together!

347
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,608
If they get outta sync,
it'll break down.

348
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,317
The timing has to be perfect.

349
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,775
Ugh. This has to be done right.

350
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,025
If only we knew a pair

351
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:03,900
who were perfectly
coordinated and energetic.

352
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:05,442
[ALL gasp]

353
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,108
So you came back again.
What do you want this time?

354
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,608
C'mon!

355
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,233
I'll let you guys check out
our badass science machine!

356
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,525
[KINRO]
Not interested.

357
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,192
[CHROME whines]

358
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:17,608
You've always been a
pretty stubborn guy,

359
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,983
but now it feels like
you're holding a grudge.

360
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:20,983
[SENKU chuckles]

361
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,317
He must still be upset

362
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,317
that we ruined the golden
spear I made for him.

363
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,442
Huh?

364
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,525
What now?

365
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,983
[GEN] Wow, electricity
sure is amazing!

366
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,192
Thanks, sorcery!

367
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,775
In our technological
civilization,

368
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:38,442
electricity lets us have
all sorts of nice things!

369
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,942
With our new generator,

370
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,025
we might even be able
to create and repair

371
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:44,608
gold- and silver-tipped spears.

372
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:47,108
Isn't that right, Senku?

373
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,692
Electrocoating is
pretty damn difficult.

374
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,733
Do you actually
know how to do it?

375
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,067
I don't have the faintest idea.

376
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,608
I was right about you.

377
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:59,650
Every word out of your mouth
really is just feathery fluff.

378
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,733
[GINRO, KINRO yelling]

379
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,150
They're a great team.
Perfectly in sync.

380
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,150
[SENKU chuckles]

381
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,025
Kinro and Ginro are mine now.

382
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:15,400
The Kingdom of Science is
building up a solid workforce.

383
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,692
But are they actually
generating electricity?

384
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,317
[SENKU] It's a
steam-roasted bamboo fiber.

385
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,483
[GEN]
Uh.

386
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,817
[KOHAKU]
Does it need to be that high up?

387
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,150
[SENKU chuckles]

388
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,233
[SENKU] Not really. But I
figure we might as well.

389
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,983
[gasps]

390
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,525
[GEN]
I see now.

391
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,483
He's using that bamboo fiber
to create an Edison light bulb.

392
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,817
I've never heard of
a bulb of light.

393
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,942
Chrome, does the
night scare you?

394
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:57,900
Well, yeah, because
everything gets dark.

395
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,692
Why do you ask?

396
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:07,400
[SENKU] Back in my day,
there was no darkness.

397
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,608
With old man Edison's
incandescent light bulb,

398
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:13,233
humanity beat back the night.

399
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:17,733
Conquering all
24 hours of the day.

400
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:22,275
Through the power of science,
mankind defeated the darkness.

401
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,775
And now we're gonna do it again.

402
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:31,317
For the first time
in 3,700 years,

403
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,025
the flame of science will burn.
