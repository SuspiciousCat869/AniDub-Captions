00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:13,983
I'm so grateful for science.

3
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,483
For Suika and for Senku!

[yells]

00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:29,192
Learn this lesson, Magma.

7
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:34,317
If I'd had this gift of science
before... had this vision...

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,067
...I would've surpassed
you long ago.

00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,817
[GAN'EN]
Can you believe it?

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,942
Kinro's got Magma on the ground!

11
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,025
[MANTLE]
Get up, Magma!

12
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:49,233
That was really amazing, Kinro!

13
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,525
But when you wear my
watermelon mask like that,

14
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:52,817
you look pretty silly.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,317
[SENKU, CHROME]
Mh-hm.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,233
[GINRO]
Hooray! Magma's all worn out!

17
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,900
Kinro's definitely gonna
win this round for us!

18
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,275
Woohoo!

19
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:03,983
That means we are on our way
to the ultimate victory!

20
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,275
We're definitely gonna get
that medicine to Ruri now!

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,733
[MAGMA] I guess that watermelon
mask is your sorcery?

22
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:15,400
That's against the
rules, isn't it?

23
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:17,942
[KINRO]
Possibly.

24
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,817
Though it may be after the fact,

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,858
we'll still have to
confirm it's allowed.

26
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:25,525
I can't move anymore.
Can barely speak.

27
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:27,233
This match is over.

28
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,858
Ask ol' Jasper, the referee.

29
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,817
If he says that it's allowed,

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,150
I'll take my loss
to you like a man.

31
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,567
[chuckles]

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,983
I can't really hear what
they're saying over there,

33
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,858
but Magma looks
so kind and gentle

34
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,400
all of a sudden, doesn't he?

35
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,942
[SENKU]
Huh.

36
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,608
[KINRO] Referee, it's quite
clear that Suika threw this mask

37
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,067
into the ring in
order to help me.

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,692
I knew that, yet
I still put it on.

39
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,233
Does this nullify my victory?

40
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:55,525
The rules are the rules.

41
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,108
Come on, man.

42
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:59,525
If it's gonna cost you the win,
just keep your damn mouth shut.

43
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,900
Kinro has to follow the rules,
he just can't help it.

44
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,233
You didn't use the item as
a weapon during the match.

45
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:10,483
It's merely an
article of clothing.

46
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,442
Therefore, I see no issue-- Uh!

47
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,275

[laughs]

49
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:58,817
I knew you couldn't let it go
without asking for permission.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,733
You're too much of a rule
lover and do-gooder

51
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,150
to just take the win!

52
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,525
Right, Kinro?

53
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,192

58
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:17,192
Kinro! Talk to me!

59
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,275
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,983
It's okay! You're alive!

61
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,525
[chuckles] That's
just how it goes.

62
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,608
We're approaching
this as a team,

63
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:28,942
so as long as somebody
beats Magma, we win.

64
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,775
Kinro lost, but it
looks like he dealt

65
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,567
plenty of damage to him.

66
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,400
That's what matters most.

67
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,567
Round two. Mantle
and Chrome, come forth!

68
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,025
Oh, it's my turn?

69
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,525
[SENKU] I'm more worried about
the match after this one.

70
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,358
Yeah.

71
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,775
[SENKU] If Kohaku isn't back
by the end of your fight,

72
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:49,817
she'll be disqualified.

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,067
[CHROME]
Yeah. I know.

74
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,025
[SUIKA]
Hm? Where is Kohaku?

75
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,275
Did she run off
somewhere or something?

76
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,608
Yeah, actually, she went
down to the river earlier

77
00:04:58,692 --> 00:04:59,900
to try and save you.

78
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,817
[SUIKA]
Huh? I have to go and find her!

79
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,983
Stay right here.
You need glasses, remember?

80
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,067
[SENKU] It's too late anyway.
All we can do is wait.

81
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,275

time as I possibly can.

between Kinro and Magma...

Hang in there, you guys!

Chrome's a joke.

He's not gonna give me
any problem at all.

I'll kill him if he makes
it far enough to face me.

This is real bad.

Now it's time to begin
today's third match.

102

Due to Kohaku's absence,

You just barely missed it!

[SUIKA] I'm so sorry!
Mantle caught me and--!

Thank goodness!

[KOHAKU]
I'm so happy he was lying.

111
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,733
I was afraid that we'd
lost you forever.

But you're okay!

113
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,733
This is all my fault.

114
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,567
You lost the fight 'cause of me.

115
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,983
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for this to happen.

116
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,608
Nothing we can do about that.

117
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,983
Besides, you didn't
do anything wrong,

118
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,900
so it's not your fault.

119
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,358
[TITAN] Doesn't really seem like
we need to keep going, does it?

120
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:19,733
[CARBO]
Nope.

121

and we have a new chief.

123

[CARBO]
It's Magma!

Be happy, sweet Ruri.

125

For as of today,
you are Magma's woman.

[KOHAKU, SUIKA grunt]

127
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,942
Kohaku was our best
chance at ultimate victory,

128
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,733
but now we're left
with just one fighter

129
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,108
from the Kingdom of Science.

130
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,817
Bodyguard Ginro, you're the
only hope we've got!

131
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,775
[GINRO]
Bodyguard Ginro.

132
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,525
Do you actually think he's
got a shot against Magma?

133
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,400
To put it nicely,
it's gonna be tough.

[chuckles]

135
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,233
[GINRO] You said it
best yourself, Senku.

136
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,192
We're gonna game the hell
out of this Grand Bout

137
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,775
to work in our favor.

138
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:04,900
Which means the strongest
isn't necessarily gonna win.

139
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,692
So we gotta use
everything that we have.

140
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,692
I'm sure you noticed I've
been chewing on something,

141
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:11,692
but did anybody
wonder what it is?

142
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,233
I think I know what it is.

143
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:16,150
It's the raw ingredients
for Senku's power-up drink!

144
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:18,733
And you've really just kept that
in your cheeks like a squirrel

145
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,067
this whole time?

146
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,150
I was saving it for when
my match was gonna start.

147
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,233
[JASPER]
Ginro! Argo! Come forth!

[chuckles]

149

[GINRO] Senku is able
to do some crazy stuff

150
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,108
with his science skills.

151
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:34,733
I learned that lesson when we
went to get that dangerous acid.

152
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:38,400
He was making that special
power-up drink for us earlier.

153
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:41,317
I bet the raw stuff is
even more effective!

154

You idiot!

155
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,692
You're just going to end up
getting the runs, man!

he's better off not knowing.

it to the final match,

it's game over.

Ginro's too messed up to fight.

And it's no secret that Senku's
not any kind of warrior.

That means...

216
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,108
The only way for us to save Ruri

217
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:28,233
is for me to take down
Magma in the next match.

[JASPER]
Magma. Chrome. Come forward!

[SENKU] You realize what's
at stake here, Chrome.

If you can take down Magma,
you'll be the new village chief,

as well as Ruri's husband.

If this was a normal fight,

there's no way that he
could beat that monster.

But we're doing this as a team.

All we can do now is
hope Kinro inflicted

enough damage to him
in the earlier match.

At least, that's his intention.

The magnifying glass I used
to start a fire is convex,

crouching over Suika's mask,

he dripped water over

I don't believe it.

But using his own
sweat and tears,

00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,692
how will I get that
bottle of cola?

320
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,108
[chuckles]

321
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,358
Let me guess.

322
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,275
You've been watching the
whole time, haven't you?

323
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,108
Exactly how much time does
he need to start the fire?

324
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,733
That's the big question.

325
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:12,358
Well, you ask like that math
is simple. Turns out it isn't.

326
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,608
However, I can figure it out.

327
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:16,858
[gasps]

328
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,192
A diameter of five centimeters.

329
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:24,275
eter.
The solar constant is 1,362
watts per square

330
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,692
Damn it, calculating the
heat transfer rate

331
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,400
mentally isn't easy.

332
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:33,067
2.6821 rounded down to 2.86.

333
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,525
The radiation rate is
zero in calm winds.

334
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:38,567
Fur ignition conditions
are close to paper.

335
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,817
With a specific heat
of 1.3 kilojoules,

336
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,858
a density of 900 kilograms
per cubic meter,

337
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:47,108
and an ignition point
of 300 degrees Celsius...

338
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:53,525
Sixty seconds. Right on the dot.

339
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,650
[GEN]
Okay.

340
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:59,275
Sounds like it's time for this
mentalist to go to work.

341
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,942
[MAGMA]
Would ya hurry up already?

342
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,150
Get on with it before
I decide to kill you.

343
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,067
[GEN]
Oh, Magma!

344
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,233
[gasps]

345
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,233
I just wanted to say thank you.

346
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,608
You know, for killing
me the other day?

347
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:21,358
Uh! It's you! The
sorcerer from outside!

348
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,400
Impossible! But how
are you still alive?

349
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,567
Why, by using my
sorcery of course!

350
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,150
[laughing]

351
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:35,775
I've put a curse on you!

352
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:37,942
Your heart will explode
the moment you take

353
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:41,483
even a single step,
so tread lightly, Magma!

354
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,858
[VILLAGER C]
His heart will explode?

355
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:44,108
[VILLAGER A]
He'll die in seconds?

356
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,317
This obviously counts as
outside interference!

357
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,525
And that's cheating!

358
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,858
[SENKU] Only if your
heart actually explodes.

359
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,942
But if he's only bluffing,
then it's just a taunt, right?

360
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,608
Which isn't against the rules.

361
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:57,400
You could always move around
and test out the theory.

362
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:00,108
Will your heart really
explode? Who knows?

363
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:00,983
[KINRO]
That's dirty.

364
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,608
[KOHAKU]
So dirty.

365
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,442
Hurry up, Chrome!

366
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,983
This is your chance to win while
I have him incapacitated!

367
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,775
Oh. But I'm so terrified.

368
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:24,983
I seem to be frozen.
Just paralyzed by fear.

369
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,650
Come on, that has to be the
worst acting I have ever seen!

370
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,733
[SENKU chuckles]

371
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,275
It's still good enough.

372
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,983
Plus, Gen made it convincing.

373
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,900
Get him! Please! I beg you!

374
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,442
Casting this spell is using the
last of my magic reserves!

375
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,567
I can only hold it
one minute. Ick-quay!

376
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,608
[MAGMA laughs]

377
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,858
[MAGMA] Good thing
you're a pathetic wimp.

378
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,650
All I have to do is
wait long enough

379
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,358
for the sorcerer's
magic to run out,

380
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,275
and then I'm gonna pummel you!

381
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,150
[SENKU]
Not bad, mentalist.

382
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:59,025
[GEN] Our dear Kinro has done
quite a bit of damage to Magma.

383
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:02,775
Then Magma started in on Chrome
with hardly any strength left.

384
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,067
I understand. He just
wants a little break.

385
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,942
And now I've gifted him
the perfect excuse.

386
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:12,400
He can rest while he waits
for the sorcery to wear off.

387
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,900
The fact is, people
will buy any cheap lie

388
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,567
if it'll justify their
unending laziness.

389
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,525
Which is why you were so
quick to fall for my sorcery.

390
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,567
Silly, Magma.

391
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,650
[VILLAGER D]
What's the matter?

392
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,900
[VILLAGER E]
Would you go already?

393
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:27,275
--[VILLAGER B] Hurry up!
--[VILLAGER F] Get him!

394
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,483
[SENKU]
Gen bought us 60 seconds.

395
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,150
Now, Chrome,
the rest is up to you.

396
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,442
That's enough time
under ideal conditions.

397
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,192
But even the rippling of
the water on the lens

398
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,150
can throw that off.

399
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,733
[CHROME]
Crap.

400
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:44,233
It's impossible to keep the tip
of this spear completely still!

401
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:47,650
You can do this. Calm your mind.

402
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,858
Wow, Chrome. Thank you!

403
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,608
[CHROME]
I'm going to save Ruri.

404
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:10,942
[CHROME] Senku's science,
Gen's magic, and my tenacity.

405
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:14,567
With our strengths combined,
we will succeed!

406
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,192
The light will start a fire!

407
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:20,858
[MAGMA]
Huh?

408
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:22,358
Now slap it.

409
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:24,317
What the--? What is this?

410
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,942
[screams]

411
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,317
It's a surface flash phenomenon.

412
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,483
The tiny fuzz all over his
clothing spreads fire instantly.

413
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,067
[MANTLE stammering]

414
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,817
[CHROME]
Hey, Magma, try and relax.

415
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,692
I have no intention of
becoming a murderer,

416
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:42,108
so just this once,
I'll help you out.

417
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,608
[CHROME yells]

418
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,942
[screaming]

419
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,692
[JASPER]
Winner: Chrome!

420
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,983
Yeah! Take that, Magma!

421
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,067
Woohoo!

422
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,442
Now there's only three
contestants left!

423
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:09,983
Senku, plus Chrome,
and our dear little Ginro.

424
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,233
Chrome won!

425
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:15,733
[SUIKA]
Everyone left is on our side!

426
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,317
That's right!

427
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,358
No matter what,
it's total victory

428
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,442
for the Kingdom of Science!
