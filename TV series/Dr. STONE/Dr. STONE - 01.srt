00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,317
[NARRATOR]
On that day,

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,942
every man, woman,
and child on Earth

3
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,567
instantly turned to stone.

4
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,775
This is it, Senku.

5
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:20,150
My mind's made up!

6
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,983
I'm finally gonna do it!

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,733
After five long years,
I'm tellin' her how I feel!

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,150
[SENKU]
Wow. Fascinating.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,150
I can't leave the lab right now,

10
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:33,192
but I promise to cheer
you on so vociferously,

11
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:35,108
my vocal cords'll snap.

12
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,733
Awesome! You mean it?

13
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,067
You rock, Senku!

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,650
No, you big oaf.

15
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,317
I won't project my voice even
one millimeter for your cause.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,108
What? Come on, man!

17
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,400
Look, you've felt this
way for five years,

18
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,692
but never said anything?

19
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:49,692
I can't praise such
illogical behavior,

20
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,608
but I can give you
something logical as hell.

21
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,525
I've developed this drug
as a kind of "love potion."

22
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,733
It maxes out your
pheromone levels,

23
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,775
granting you a ten
billion percent chance

24
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,608
of winning her heart.

25
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,483
[gasps]

26
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,233
[TAIJU]
Thanks, but no thanks, Senku.

27
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,567
I gotta do this my way.

28
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,358
[door slams]

29
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,108
[STUDENT C]
Whoa, are you serious?

30
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,317
You made a love potion?

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,525
[SENKU]
Come on, use your brain.

32
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,983
It's gasoline.

33
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:26,108
I simply refined it from
plastic bottle caps.

34
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:29,233
Consider the molecular
structure of polyethylene.

35
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:31,192
It's just like a long
gasoline molecule

36
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,067
minus a few hydrocarbons.

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,733
You can tell by just looking.

38
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:35,733
[STUDENT E]
Well, I can't.

39
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,275
[STUDENT D]
Me, neither.

40
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,858
Yeah, but... If Taiju drank it,
wouldn't that've killed him?

41
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:42,400
[chuckles]

42
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:45,775
No, the odds of him drinking
that were ten billion to one.

43
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:48,150
He's dumb, but too strait-laced.

44
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,817
[TAIJU]
Yuzuriha!

45
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,567
Sorry I'm late!

46
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:58,483
It's fine.

47
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,233
So what's going on, Taiju?

48
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:01,733
You wanted to talk to me?

[giggles]

50
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:05,858
A hundred yen on heartbreak.

51
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,692
Three hundred on her
making him cry.

52
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,692
Five hundred on her
calling him a creep.

53
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:13,483
[SENKU] I bet ten thousand
that she's into him, too.

[GUYS]
Seriously?

55
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,775
[TAIJU] All this time,
I've been so scared

56
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:20,150
that if I tell her how
I really feel about her,

57
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,983
she could not want to
be my friend anymore.

58
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,317
But I can't keep it
a secret forever.

It's like this, Yuzuriha.

All right. No turning back now!

But I can't die a coward!

What happened?

Is it like some kinda disease
that made your skin harden up?

121
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,567
[YUZURIHA] Well, of course
the vet's office

122
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,608

before school hours.

obviously a statue or something

126
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:15,608
and not a real bird, but you
still brought it to the vet.

You're so silly.
It's embarrassing.

I'm a big ol' dummy, too.

Now we're both gonna
be late for school!

Yeah, whoops!

Not even after
thousands of years.

I never lost hope.

And now...

148
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm really proud of you!

And you're incredible,
too, tree!

You kept her safe
for this entire time!

Like you held onto
her. Thank you!

00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,608
Sorry, but I just
couldn't protect you.

153
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,067
In fact, when you
really think about it,

154
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,067
you were actually the
one protecting me.

155
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,400
I was able to stay alive
because of you.

156
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,108
It's the truth.

157
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,900
You were my light
shining in the darkness

158
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,233
for hundreds, even
thousands of years.

159
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,483
And now, I can finally say it.

160
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:05,567
I started back then,
but I never got to finish.

161
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,650
So what I was gonna tell
you that day... is that...

162
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,150
...that I...

163
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,567
[TAIJU]
I've loved you...

164
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,317
...for hundreds and
thousands of years.

165
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,983
I swear on my life,
I'll save you!

166
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,608
Don't know how,
but I'll find a way.

167
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:02,817
Okay? So just wait--

168
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,275
Huh?

169
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:10,192
[TAIJU] "Follow the river
downstream, big oaf"?

170
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,192
[SENKU chuckles]

171
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,400
[SENKU]
Well, look who's finally awake.

172
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,733
Good morning, ya big oaf.

173
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,900
[TAIJU screams]

174
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,025
Oh, Senku! You're alive, too?!

175
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,150
Don't you dare hug me
while you're buck naked!

176
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,358
Hands off! I'm not joking!

177
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,608
[sighs]

178
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:38,733
It's October fifth,
in the year 5738.

179
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,900
You really slept in for
a hell of a long time.

180
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,192
I've been up and diligently
working my tail off

181
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,942
for the last six months.

182
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,442
Hold on. So it's been, like...

183
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,817
[SENKU]
It has been 3,700 years.

184
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,733
[gasps]

185
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,567
How do you know what day it is?

186
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,525
You got some kinda
calendar, or what?

187
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,358
Huh? I figured it
out by counting.

188
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,733
It was the logical thing to do.

189
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:09,817
[SENKU]
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

190
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,442
Damn, almost lost
consciousness again.

191
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:17,400
Seems to happen about every
800 thousand seconds.

192
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,900
Heh.

193
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:22,150
It's about as regular as my
bowel movements used to be.

194
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,650
I'll need to think and
count at the same time.

195
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,525
Run parallel processes.

196
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:27,858
One hundred-sixteen billion,

197
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,400
four hundred
twenty-seven million,

198
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:32,442
sixty-five thousand,
five hundred-thirty seconds.

199
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:40,067
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

200
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,942
So that whole time you were
frozen, you just counted?

201
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,775
[SENKU] Even if I had willed
myself awake before then,

202
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,567
being out here stark-naked
with no supplies in winter

203
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,942
would've have meant game
over pretty damn quickly.

204
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:56,317
I realized I would have to start
things up in the springtime.

205
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,817
So keeping an extremely
precise account of the time

206
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,025
was an absolute must.

207
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,317
All right, we're here.

208
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,567
We need to put a pin in the
small talk and get to work.

209
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:14,817
Senku, you're tellin' me...
you did this on your own?

210
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,733
[SENKU] Until now,
I've been lacking manpower.

211
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,692
And coming up with the
bare minimum to survive

212
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,733
takes all my time.

213
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,983
If I'm gonna
rebuild civilization,

214
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,942
I'll need a muscle-y meathead
to do the grunt-work.

215
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:33,192
In other words, I've been
waiting for you, Taiju.

216
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:36,525
I was ten billion percent
sure you were still alive.

217
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,983
You were so hell bent on
confessing your love.

218
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,858
And for a guy as
stubborn as you,

219
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,817
even a few thousand
years wouldn't stop you

220
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,650
from making that happen.

221
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,275
You aren't that weak!

222
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,942
Yeah. Of course I'm not!

223
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:59,900
[TAIJU] All right, Senku, if you
can handle all the brainy stuff,

224
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:03,400
you can leave the heavy
lifting to me, no problem!

225
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,900
[SENKU] It took humanity
over two million years

226
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,942
to crawl out of the stone
age to the modern age.

227
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:13,275
We need to do that in a sprint.

228
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,900
I swear, I'm going to
take back the world.

229
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:18,358
Through science, I'll figure
out what happened to us,

230
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:20,192
and how we broke free.

231
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:23,525
[TAIJU] I swear,
I'm gonna save Yuzuriha!

232
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,650
[SENKU] We may be a couple
of high-school kids,

233
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:29,275
but we're gonna rebuild
civilization from the ground up.

234
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,233
You and I will be
like Adam and Eve.

235
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:34,442
Together, we'll bring life
back to this Stone World.

236
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,317
This is exhilarating.
Get excited.

237
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,900
That's definitely a
plus-sized haul, Taiju.

238
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,692
You have a real-life
cheat code for stamina?

239
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,192
[TAIJU yells]

240
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:55,900
[SENKU]
Amanita virosa, toxic.

241
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:57,400
Buna shimeji, safe.

242
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,358
Amanita muscaria, toxic.

243
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,317
If something looks like it's out
of a Mario game, pass it up.

244
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,275
Next. Mugwort, that's edible.

245
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,983
Wolf's bane. Are you
trying to poison us?

246
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,483
Oh, man! What the heck
did you season this with?

247
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,983
Just some salt that I
pulled out of the seawater.

248
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,983
A little pinch of it will make
almost anything palatable.

249
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,733
We can utilize it for
pickling food as well.

250
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,775
One of primitive man's greatest
discoveries, I'd say.

251
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,442
Thank you, Senku.
This is perfect!

252
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,608
I may not know all
the stuff that you do,

253
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,983
but I'm gonna bust my
back workin' for us!

254
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,358
[TAIJU yells]

255
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:37,025
[TAIJU] Time to check out
the other direction!

256
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,483
[TAIJU]
Whoa, these look like grapes.

257
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,525
Can we eat these, too?

258
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:45,858
There's one way to find
out. Get in my belly!

259
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,858
[TAIJU]
Hm?

260
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,192
I know I've seen that guy on TV.

261
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,483
He's called the "strongest
primate high-schooler."

262
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,025
Shishio Tsukasa.

263
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,233
Guess he couldn't
fight it, either.

264
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,692
[TAIJU gasps]

265
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,275
[TAIJU]
What's that?

266
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,692
Whoa!

267
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,233
Me and Senku haven't
been here yet,

268
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,192
so that means
someone else survived!

269
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,942
I gotta know who they are!

270
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,525
[SENKU]
It was me, idiot.

271
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,983
Oh, no way!

272
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,400
Are we the only ones
left, for real?

273
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,733
Like, the last
humans still alive?

274
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:31,108
[SENKU] We'll get more.
That's a top priority.

275
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,942
I mean, the two of us alone,
just a couple of dudes?

276
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,233
Can't "restart humanity"
if you catch my drift.

277
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,858
Yeah. That's true.

278
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:42,025
[SENKU]
Besides, why, after 3,700 years,

279
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,483
did we break free from
our petrified condition?

280
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,692
[TAIJU]
The stone rotted away?

281
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,275
[SENKU]
Well, something like that.

282
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,775
Say this strange mineral
had been corroded...

283
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,275
[chuckles]

284
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,942
Can you chalk up the timing
to mere random coincidence?

285
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,942
Six months apart is a
relative blip on the radar.

286
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:00,692
There's a reason why we both
reanimated so close together.

287
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,442
We drifted up near here.

288
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,275
It would make sense that this
cave factored in somehow.

289
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:09,733
See that? The stuff
trickling from overhead?

290
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:13,108
That's our miracle fluid,
made from bat guano.

291
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:14,650
Good ol' nitric acid.

292
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,400
No way! That's crazy!

293
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,150
What is that?

294
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,233
[SENKU]
I did anticipate that question.

295
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:25,275
But I'm not going to waste my
breath explaining it to you.

296
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:26,442
[TAIJU]
Let me guess.

297
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,192
You pour some of the
miracle stuff on it,

298
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,150
the stone breaks,
and the bird wakes up.

299
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,650
How I wish it were
so straightforward.

300
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,150
That would rule.

301
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,567
[SENKU] I've been working
like a madman on this project,

302
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,900
using every last method
I could think of.

303
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:48,150
[gasps]

304
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:51,025
[SENKU]
Over and over, again and again.

305
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,275
It's like something
from a fantasy world.

306
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:54,525
Is it all mineral?

307
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:56,650
Are there living
cells underneath?

308
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,525
I don't have the laboratory
for in-depth analysis.

309
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,858
So basically what
you're telling me is,

310
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,067
there are things even
science can't explain.

311
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,900
[SENKU chuckles]

312
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,692
There we go,
that tired old cliché.

313
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:12,150
Truth is, it never quite stands
up to the scientific method.

314
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:15,192
Science is often a slow process.

315
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,900
Some liquor might
speed things up.

316
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:18,775
[TAIJU]
Huh?

317
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,567
Combined with the nitric acid,

318
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,692
we could make something
nice and potent.

319
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,525
What's commonly known as nital,

320
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,775
which is an industrial-
strength etching agent.

321
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,983
[TAIJU]
What did you say we needed?

322
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,150
Huh? I said we could make nital.

323
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,900
It gets into the ferrite
grain boundary an--

324
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,233
No!

325
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,317
Don't confuse me with some
kinda "science talk."

326
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,358
I mean, the part about liquor.

327
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,025
Wine comes from grapes, yeah?

328
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,192
And that is a type
of alcohol, isn't it?

329
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,067
[SENKU chuckles]

330
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,525
[SENKU]
Not bad, you big oaf.

331
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,567
[SENKU groans]

332
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,150
[TAIJU yelling]

333
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:58,525
[SENKU]
Hm.

334
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,692
Yeah, we'll have you handle
all the neck-down work

335
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:01,733
from here on out.

336
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,817
It's just the logical choice.

337
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,775
[SENKU] Making wine is an
extremely simple process.

338
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:11,692
Crush your grapes or fruit,
put it in a container,

339
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,567
and stir it up every day
until it's ready to go.

340
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,817
Heh.

341
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
But if we tried this
back in our time,

342
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,650
we'd get arrested for
not having a license.

343
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,067
[SENKU]
It's been three weeks.

344
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,900
That should do the trick.

345
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,025
[TAIJU]
Thought of something.

346
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,233
Underage drinking's
a crime, too.

347
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,483
[SENKU chuckles]

348
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,858
Not a problem.

349
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,775
After all, we're both a
little over 3,700 years old.

350
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:36,233
Oh, yeah, that's right.

351
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,775
[TAIJU laughs]

352
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,817
Not bad. Way better
than expected.

353
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,233
Bet it's ten billion times worse

354
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,733
than what was on
the market, though.

355
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:49,983
That was so easy.

356
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,483
Just stomping grapes
and waiting around?

357
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,858
One step at a time, my friend.

358
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:58,692
Though I hate to say it,
our pace'll slow down.

359
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,983
This'll be a course in
"distilling wine for dummies."

360
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:03,442
Our goal is to acquire
some brandy.

361
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:06,233
[TAIJU] Distilling, huh?
No idea what that means.

362
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,108
I knew you'd say that.

363
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,358
It's heating, cooling,
and dripping.

364
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,817
That'll concentrate the alcohol.

365
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,983
Don't worry.

366
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,775
People back in
ancient Mesopotamia

367
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:19,525
were doing this with
clay pots in 3000 B.C.

368
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,817
And if they can do it,
then so can we!

369
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,858
Now get excited, Taiju.

370
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,442
Listen up, big oaf.

371
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,942
Lesson one:

372
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,108
It's not that there are things
science can't explain.

373
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,608
Not in the least.

374
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,025
[cracking]

375
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,400
[SENKU] There are rules behind
everything that happens.

376
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,733
Science is just the name for the
steady, pain-in-the-ass effort

377
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:30,525
that goes into finding
out what they are.

378
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,983
[TAIJU yells]

379
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:51,358
[screams]

380
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,150
[SENKU sighs]

381
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,983
I've been experimenting
for a year now.

382
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,567
It actually didn't take
as long as I'd imagined.

383
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,317
Heh. Slow and steady
wins the race.

384
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,358
I'm gonna beat fantasy with
science as my only weapon.

385
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:21,983
[SENKU]
Oh, yeah. Get excited.
