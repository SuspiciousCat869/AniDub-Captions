00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,567
Thanks, but I'm
strictly a cola man.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,025
Never heard of it.

4
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:18,025
I wouldn't be able to talk
business if I got drunk.

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:19,317
And now that the
village is gathered,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,692
I've got a message to deliver.

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,150
[SENKU]
Yeah?

8
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,858
Well, let's hear it then,
mentalist. What've you got?

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,275
I can take a guess.
The Tsukasa Empire?

10
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,233
He's coming.

11
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,983
And he's bringing an army.

12
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,483
[ALL gasp]

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,817
[TSUKASA] Gen, you haven't
actually seen Senku's body.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,650
If he's out there
somewhere alive,

15
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:46,900
he'll likely discover
the village

16
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:51,108
and use it to build his
Kingdom of Science.

17
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:54,942
And that would be the worst
conceivable scenario.

18
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,817
As soon as we've
assembled an army,

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,817
we will take the
village by force.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,025
An entire army of men like him?

21
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:07,358
All of them ridiculously
strong and just as ruthless?

22
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,067
That's the idea, yes.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,775
He's been very busy
reviving people.

24
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,150
[chuckles]

25
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,067
[SENKU] It's finally come
to an all-out war

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,442
between the Kingdom of Science
and the Empire of Might.

27
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:23,942
Time for a showdown.
Get excited.

It's not fair. I wanna party.

30
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:36,067
If it weren't for Mr.
"The rules are the rules,"

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,067
I'd be back there living it up
with the rest of them right now.

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,442
Protecting the
village is our duty.

33
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,692
If they're going to attack,
this would be the time.

34
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,525
While we're off-guard.

00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,983
[KINRO] Ginro, go back and
alert the others. Now.

00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,567

Huh? About what?

[gasps]

00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,525
[KINRO] If they reach
the living quarters

00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:08,942
where the children
are, it's over.

00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:12,192
Listen, if I'm killed,
cut down the bridge.

42
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,608
Don't worry about my body.

[HYOGA]
Hmm.

45
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,733
He knows the numbers
aren't in his favor,

46
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,775
so he's hoping to lure
us onto the bridge

47
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,483
to fight him one at a time.

48
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:40,108
I like it.
He's a proper warrior.

49
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,858
Look at this guy,
tryin' to run away!

of us, caveman?

[HYOGA]
Huh.

53
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,192
You're even more
mush-brained than I imagined

54
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,067
if you thought you could
win against a spearman

55
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,608
on a narrow bridge.

56
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:47,858
That strategy wasn't
proper at all.

I think he broke my nose.

58

Um. We're sorry, Hyoga, sir.

59

[HYOGA]
Hmm. Interesting.

60
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,275
You have poor
eyesight, don't you?

61
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,483
And Tsukasa isn't the
only major threat.

62
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,358
There's another among
them who's bad ews-nay.

If either he or Tsukasa show up
at the head of the war party,

65
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,150
frankly, you would have
no choice but to run.

66

[GEN] His name is Hyoga, and
he was only recently revived.

67
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,900
I offered to go in as a spy
and stir things up--

68
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,150
lay the groundwork.

69
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,775
So I left first, before
the rest of the forces.

it'll buy us, though.

No! Impossible!

move his spear so quickly?

Let me go. I have to help!

narrow and he's got a spear!

They're right. I have to.

Cut down the bridge...
and save the village.

There you go.

93

I can no longer be saved.

00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,275
[GINRO]
I can't.

95
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,900
I can't cut the bridge down.

96
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:32,692
If I do that...
Kinro is going to die!

97
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,775
How could I ever kill
my own brother?

Hm?

to do with an iron tube?

We're down to the last
of our gunpowder.

we'd be using it for a bluff?

Yeah.

Would you kindly throw
this rock at the enemy?

As hard as you can.

110

Huh? How am I supposed to hit
them from here with that?

111

And why should I listen to
an outsider like you, anyway?

You don't have to hit them.

Senku's the chief, but you want
to take the title away from him.

How will you do that if
the whole village is lost?

It was very considerate
of you guys

to give us time to
finish preparing.

delighted to hear that.

133

[SENKU]
Pass on a message for me.

134
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:21,150
Tell Tsukasa that Ishigami
Senku is still alive,

135
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,942
and let him know
we're waiting for him

136
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:27,067
with the ten billion rifles we
made using the power of science.

Ah!

00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:36,317
He's dead! Kinro's dead!

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,275
[KINRO]
No. I'm still alive.

140
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,733
Don't go killing me off, Ginro.

141
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:46,942
Acetanilide, an antipyretic,
and an analgesic.

142
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,858
We had to whip up a batch in
order to make the sulfa drug.

143
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,067
And now, a pinch of this!

144
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,067
Rub some of this in your wounds
and you'll be fine by tomorrow.

145
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,900
Probably.

146

Here, have some more!

00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,317
That soon?!

[CHROME] You're making
that up, aren't you?

[SENKU yells]

150
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,150
It doesn't hurt at all now.

That's bad!

Hold on. He's just acting tough.
He's still nowhere near okay!

153
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,817
I can't guard the village
if I'm bedridden

154

for some minor injury.

155
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,942
There's no telling
when those bastards

156
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,400
will come back to attack
us in full force.

You're so dedicated!

He's still Kinro.

00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,317
Yeah. He's got it wrong, though.

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,983
We can predict exactly when
they'll be coming back.

161
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,108
[GOZAN yells]

162
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,067
[GOZAN] I can't go
crawling back to Tsukasa

163
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,400
after being utterly humiliated
by a bunch of weaklings!

164
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:38,942
Damn it!

165
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:40,608
Those twigs would be nothing
if it weren't for their guns!

166
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:42,150
I have a suggestion.

167
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,775
Why not attack during a storm

168
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,025
when they can't use
their matchlocks?

169
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,233
They'll time their attack
to occur during a storm

170
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:51,650
'cause they're afraid of
our nonexistent rifles.

171
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,733
Gen will talk them into it.

172
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,442
Ah, I get it. Can't light
fuses when it's raining.

173
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,942
[HYOGA] The outcome of our
attack was less than ideal,

174
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,400
but whining about it
now is pointless.

175
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:04,900
As for striking during a storm,

176
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,817
it's such an obvious move,
it might well get us killed.

177
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,608
[GOZAN]
Huh?!

178
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,275
[HYOGA] Now that we
know Senku is alive,

179
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:14,317
the tables have
turned 180 degrees.

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,150
Let's do this properly.

181
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,025
We should return
to Tsukasa at once

182
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,567
and build as large
an army as we can.

183
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,900
Ha! What's the matter,
Hyoga? Are you scared?

184
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,067
You're just like those
villagers, aren't ya?

185
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,900
You're a hopeless little
twig without that weapon.

186
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:32,525
Your <i>kudayari</i> or
whatever you call it.

187
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,067
A <i>kudayari</i> ?

188
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,067
Is that the name of this spear
with the little bamboo tube?

189
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,858
I've never seen one before.

190
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,400
[HYOGA] I strongly suggest
putting that down.

191
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,108
Unless you want me to kill you.

192
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,525
Ah! Right, hands off!
Sorry, Hyoga!

193
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:46,567
[GOZAN]
It's settled!

194
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,483
We'll attack as soon
as a storm hits!

195
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,442
Yeah!

196
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,358
[KYOICHIRO]
All right!

197
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,567
[HYOGA]
If they're so eager for a fight,

198
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,442
sending them against
Senku might make

199
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,983
for a good opening
gambit, after all.

200
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,442
Who knows? We may
be able to win.

201
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,983
But if those apes
fight and lose,

202
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:06,858
at least we'll have seen the
Kingdom of Science's hand.

203
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,400
They're not worth much in
this game, even as pawns.

204
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,192
[GINRO]
Ahh...

205
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,942
[KINRO]
Hm.

206
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,817
Aw, man, he looks
like a badass!

207
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,317
I like them.

208
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,358
[TURQUOISE] And those should
cure his fuzzy eye sickness?

209
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,525
[KOKUYO] Sorcery or science,
whatever you call it,

210
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:26,608
it's impressive.

211
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,400
I'm so glad Kinro
won't have to deal

212
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,650
with the fuzzy sickness anymore.

213
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,608
Oh, hey. You got some
new glasses too, huh?

214
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:34,608
Sure did!

215
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,858
Different than Kinro's,

216
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,067
but this just feels more
right for me, y'know?

217
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,650
That's not all the scientific
battle prep we're doin', either.

218
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,567
[KOHAKU] The man in the black
mask is quite formidable.

219
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,108
Do you have some way to
use science to fight him?

220
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,608
Yeah.

221
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,608
You and the rest of the battle
team are gonna be in tears

222
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,108
when you see what it is.

223
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,442
It's time to show off your
skills, are you ready?

224
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,858
[KASEKI]
Hm?

225
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,567
[inaudible]

226
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,733
[KASEKI] Oh, yeah!
You better believe I'm ready!

227
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,358
[yells]

228
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,817
[RUBY screams]

229
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,025
[KOHAKU]
Just the thought of crafting

230
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:11,192
does disturbing things
to his muscles.

231
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,025
We need to hurry
and get started.

232
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,525
There's no time to waste!

233
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:15,900
We're in a race
against the storm

234
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,775
and we can't afford to lose now.

235
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:20,108
[CHROME]
Heck yeah!

236
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,608
[SENKU] All hands on deck,
Ishigami Village!

237
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,275
[VILLAGERS]
Right!

238
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,900
A powerful wind's blowing
in from the mountains.

239
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,608
[GOZAN laughs]

240
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,358
It's a storm! And we only
had to wait three days.

241
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,983
The heavens are
obviously on our side!

242
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,275
Let's see how they fight
without their guns.

243
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,692
[GOZAN laughs]

244
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,150
[laughing]

245
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,858
[chuckles]

246
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,525
They have Japanese katanas!

247
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,733
[SENKU chuckles]

248
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,317
[SENKU] These are the
most powerful weapons

249
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,233
in the Stone World.

250
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,650
[SENKU]
The blades of science.

251
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,317
[HYOGA]
Proper weapons. I like it.

252
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,775
Well done, Kingdom of Science.

253
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,608
They might not be
perfectly finished,

254
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,025
but they'll do the job.

255
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,108
[MAGMA yells]

256
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,733
[KINRO]
I can see clearly.

257
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,567
This is the power of glasses!

258
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,608
[GINRO] I have Magma, Kohaku,
and Kinro by my side.

259
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:10,983
We can do this!

260
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,692
[KOHAKU] Ha! It cuts through
their weapons easily.

261
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:16,317
[KOKUYO]
So this is the power of science.

262
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,442
Damn it. How did they
make blades like that?

263
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:22,692
We're screwed. Their
weapons are stronger.

264
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:32,108
[SENKU] Get it up to 1,200
degrees with pine coals.

265
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,817
When the flame turns
purple, it's ready.

266
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,692
Smack the hell out of
the metal for a while

267
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,900
to get rid of impurities.

268
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:43,525
Then we fold it, fire it up
again, and hit it some more.

269
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:48,400
This folding process is
called <i>orikaeshi tanren</i> .

270
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:51,983
Doing it repeatedly
powers up the iron.

271
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,650
It's hot, sweaty, brutal
work for the craftsman,

272
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,567
and you have to do it
at least ten times.

273
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,525
That's bad!

274
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,317
To make a real Japanese katana,

275
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,317
but we won't do it
that many times.

276
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,275
Just twice.

277
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:03,525
And that's enough?!

278
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:05,025
[SENKU chuckles]

279
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,483
We have modern science to thank
for that bit of knowledge.

280
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,733
We looked at the crystalline
structure of metal

281
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,942
and realized it was basically
done after two folds.

282
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:16,442
We aren't katana artisans.
We're going for speed.

283
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:20,442
Any step science lets
us skip, we skip.

284
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:23,358
More important than the
folding is the quenching.

285
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,650
The blade cooks right through,

286
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,733
turning into martensite
as it does,

287
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,983
but the part we coated in
clay paste bakes less

288
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,067
becoming semi-ferrite.

289
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,317
Let's see.

290
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,275
I don't know much about
the science behind it,

291
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,900
but the point is,

292
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,275
the blade itself is made
strong for cutting,

293
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:40,275
and the blunt edge is made
flexible for parrying.

294
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:43,775
That's the idea, right?
Pretty amazing!

295
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,858
[chuckles]

296
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:46,317
No big surprise there.

297
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,567
I figured a craftsman
would understand.

298
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,900
Yeah, the difference between
the two sides is the key.

299
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:53,817
That's what makes
the Japanese katana

300
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,233
the most powerful
blade in the world.

301
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,150
Our weapons are breaking apart.

302
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,483
[HYOGA] It's not only your
weapons that are being broken.

303
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,650
Your feeble minds are
shattering as well.

304
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:14,317
Which, I imagine, is exactly
what Senku wanted to accomplish.

305
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,067
Hence this little display
with the Japanese katanas.

306
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,275
[HYOGA] But your katanas are
no match for my <i>kudayari</i>

307
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,692
and my Kanryu-style
of spear fighting!

308
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:28,692
[gasps]

309
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,817
[MAGMA]
It's round. Like the moon.

310
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,358
What's going on?

311
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,608
[KOHAKU] This spearman's
in a different league.

312
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,567
It's like Gen said:
He's the real threat here.

313
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,192
Magma, Kohaku, and Kinro

314
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,150
are the strongest fighters
in the village.

315
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,483
Bring down those three

316
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,150
and victory will be yours
for the taking, Hyoga!

317
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,608
[HYOGA] Thanks so much
for the advice, Gen.

318
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:05,150
Not that I couldn't have
seen it for myself.

319
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,567
That Gen bastard is helping
the enemy. What the hell?

320
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,108
Did he switch back over to
their side? That sneaky rat!

321
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,233
Calm down. He's saying
we need to join forces.

322
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:17,983
That it's the only way we're
going to defeat this guy.

323
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:19,025
All right.

324
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,608
Hey, give that back!
It's not yours!

325
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:23,275
Then let's do this,
Kinro. Magma!

326
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,775
[MAGMA yells]

327
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,233
[KOHAKU]
He's not even listening!

328
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,067
[GINRO]
Well, that's Magma for you!

329
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,692
Hmph. Whatever. We can still
coordinate our attack.

330
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,358
Magma will block his view.

331
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,275
While he does,
you give me a boost.

332
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,400
Right. You got it!

333
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,983
Um, a boost for what?

334
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:47,692
[KOHAKU yells]

335
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:56,733
[KOHAKU] He can still react
to an attack from above?

336
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,275
If I can just strike
the first blow...

337
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,733
[KOHAKU] He's twisting his
wrist to spin the tip around.

338
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:07,442
Moving that fast,
I can't tell where it is!

339
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,233
[KOHAKU gasps]

340
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,067
The tip broke off?

341
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,358
I didn't see that one coming.

342
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,108
[HYOGA] A cut that precise
couldn't have been made

343
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:28,900
with stone tools.

344
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,733
And it was well-hidden.

345
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:33,525
With enough force,
the spear falls apart.

346
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,233
It's almost like
magic, isn't it?

347
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:39,817
For eal-ray? Who would've
done such a thing?

348
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,692
A <i>kudayari</i> ?

349
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,192
Is that the name of this spear
with the little bamboo tube?

350
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:52,275
[HYOGA] I have to admit,
Gen, I'm impressed.

351
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,317
You did a proper job.

352
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,525
You fill the role of filthy
turncoat quite well.

353
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:00,358
No! You don't really
believe that, do you?

354
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,983
I would never betray your trust!

355
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,233
[GEN]
Well, damn.

356
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,400
You had me figured out already.

357
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:14,400
Guess I can't put
anything past you.

358
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,608
Suika, go give this to Gen.

359
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,483
Hm? But he went off with
those bullies of Tsukasa's

360
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,525
to who knows where,

361
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,733
so how'm I supposed
to find them?

362
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,900
A mentalist like him would've
left signs for us to follow.

363
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:35,025
Signs that only we would
be able to recognize.

364
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,067
Which makes this a job
for Detective Suika.

365
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,650
[laughs]

366
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,483
[CHALK barks]

367
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,483
[CHALK howls]

368
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,067
Hm? Hey, look at that.

369
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,067
I've only ever seen these
flowers in the sun before.

370
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,442
What are they doing
in the shade?

371
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:08,608
[CHALK barking]

372
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,233
The forest here is my
playground, so I can tell!

373
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,608
These are the signs that
Gen left for us to find!

374
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:23,608
[SUIKA]
Huh?

375
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,067
[GEN]
Do you know this flower?

376
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,650
It makes for an effective signal

377
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,733
if your allies are familiar
with natural science.

378
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,150
Black nightshade,
an old favorite of mine

379
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,817
and one I frequently
used on stage.

380
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,900
In floriography...
it means "liar."

381
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:02,275
[chuckles]

382
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,525
Wow. You made a pretty good
cut there, mentalist.

383
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,400
Your wit's almost as
sharp as our weapons.

384
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:14,400
[SENKU] We've bested you
with our blades of science.
