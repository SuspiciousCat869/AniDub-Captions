1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,400
[SENKU] Shishio Tsukasa
is an awesome guy.

2
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:16,650
Who happens to be a murderer.

3
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,108
[chuckles] If we can make
some weapons of science

4
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:21,150
before he realizes
what we're really up to,

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,567
then victory is ours.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,525
But if he gets wise
to us? Game over.

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,567
The race is on, you guys!

8
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:29,608
The gun.

9
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,150
We're gonna make some gunpowder.

10
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:36,483
Time to get excited, you guys.

11
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,942
[gasps]

12
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,192
[TSUKASA]
Hakone.

13
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,150
If they make gunpowder,
I don't stand a chance.

14
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,067
Senku can do it.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,567
So I have to stop him
before that happens.

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,275
[banging]

17
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:53,525
[chuckling]

18
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:55,400
Yuzuriha.

19
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,233
I think I should tell you
about what happened

20
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,358
while we were turned to stone.

21
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,525
On that day, long ago,

22
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,108
when I had asked you
to come and meet me

23
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:07,025
over at the camphor tree...

24
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,108
[TAIJU]
It's like this, Yuzuriha.

25
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:14,400
I've kept this inside me
for five years, and--

26
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,192
[YUZURIHA]
Well, Taiju?

27
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,733
You wanted to tell me
something back then.

28
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,108
What was it?

29
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:37,317
[TAIJU] Yuzuriha, for the
entire time I was a statue,

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,817
all I thought about
was finishing

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,525
what I started to say.

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,108
For hundreds of years,
thousands of years...

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,692
But things have changed.

34
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:49,067
And now, in this crazy Stone
World with nowhere to run to,

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,108
I just wouldn't feel right
as a man to tell you

36
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,275
what I was going
to say back then.

37
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,275
[TAIJU]
I-I'm sorry!

38
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,442
I realize that this is all
super vague and confusing

39
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,150
and you probably have no
idea what I'm talking about.

40
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,317
[YUZURIHA]
No. I'm pretty sure I do.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,817
It's up to us to bring
back civilization.

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,150
But once we've saved humanity...

43
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,317
When that's been done,
will you let me say it then,

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,067
what I wanted to say
3,700 years ago?

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,483
Will you please?

46
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,108
Yeah. It's okay.

47
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:25,817
We are gonna bring the
world back. I'm sure of it.

48
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,442
[SENKU laughs]

49
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,858
We have the three components
we need to make gunpowder.

50
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,317
For real? We got all
of 'em already?

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
The only thing left
is to mix it up.

52
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,400
It's time for a gunpowder
cooking class

53
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,483
that'll be a total blast!

54
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,150
[SENKU]
Gunpowder ingredient number one

55
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:27,358
is sulfur, which there's plenty
of at this hot spring!

56
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,733
Number two: Charcoal.

57
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:33,192
And we can get as much of it as
we want just by burning wood.

58
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,942
As for number three,
it's not as easy to come by,

59
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,608
but we need potassium nitrate.

60
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:42,025
It takes a hell of a long time
to whip up a batch, so...

61
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:43,400
Ta-dah!

62
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,400
I took the liberty of making
a bunch of it beforehand

63
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,900
to save us some precious time!

64
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,567
[TAIJU screams]

65
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,650
[TAIJU]
Hmm...

66
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,358
Nitrate sounds familiar.

67
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,067
I feel like I've
heard it before.

68
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,400
Nitric acid! Miracle fluid!

69
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,317
Did you get that
stuff outta the cave?

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,275
Surprisingly enough, you're
right for once, simpleton.

71
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,275
You get ten billion
points for that.

72
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:04,525
So now, we'll blend
our potassium nitrate

73
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,650
in with the sulfur and charcoal.

74
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,192
Let's sweeten the mixture by
throwing in a pinch of sugar

75
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,983
to give it a little more oomph.

76
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,275
A bit of this glucose
I extracted from grapes

77
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,608
should do the trick.

78
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,567
What's up, guys?
My name is Mecha-Senku.

79
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,317
That recipe we just put
together is the real deal.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,525
Meaning it can actually
create a bomb!

81
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,483
So don't try this at home!

82
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,942
Finally, pound it down
till it's packed solid!

83
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,858
--[TAIJU grunts]
--[cracking]

84
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,483
Need a poundin', bro?

85
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,900
'Cause that sounds like the
perfect kinda job for me!

86
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,650
[YUZURIHA, SENKU scream]

87
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,233
Are you sure that's a good idea?

88
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:40,650
I'm scared if you use
all your strength,

89
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,567
you could make it
spark and go boom!

90
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,317
Like with flint!

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,858
Yeah, no.

92
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,317
Hitting stone with stone doesn't
actually create any sparks.

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,483
Oh. I didn't know that.

94
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,608
Hey. You're right.

95
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,817
That's because flint is not
your ordinary type of stone.

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,775
The metal in it is
what makes the spark.

97
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:07,275
Hot springs... volcanoes...
iron pyrite...

98
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,942
Iron pyrite?

99
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:10,608

No problem, you guys!

105
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,025
This just proves our gunpowder
cooking was successful!

106
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:38,317
That's scary stuff.
We need to be careful!

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,775
Yeah.

108
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,108
It's been involved in a lot
of experiments gone wrong.

109
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,733
Not uncommon for some curious
kid to lose a limb or worse.

110
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,317
[YUZURIHA]
Huh?

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,108
Don't forget, this is a lethal
substance we're dealing with.

112
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,192
And we're planning to
use it against Tsukasa?

113
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,525
No. We'll make a deal.

114
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,942
[TAIJU]
Huh?

115
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,608
Tsukasa isn't some sort of
random, mindless murderer.

116
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,108
Think back.

117
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:07,108
When you two had your scuffle,
you remember what he said?

118
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,233
Let me make sure
I understand you.

119
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,733
You'll let me pummel
you as much as I like

120
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,483
so I stop breaking
those statues.

121
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,525
That's what you're
saying, right?

122
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:18,192
Yeah, exactly!

123
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:22,358
I don't understand. You aren't
making any kind of deal.

124
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,358
[SENKU] In other words,
under the right circumstances,

125
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,317
we can negotiate with him.

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,233
And with a little gunpowder on
our side, we'll have leverage.

127
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,942
[SENKU]
However,

128
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:37,358
if the negotiations don't
work out in the end,

129
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,067
then we'll have to...

130
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,733
[TSUKASA]
I know what Senku's doing.

131
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:46,942
If he's already successfully
made the gunpowder,

132
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,400
then I'll have to...

133
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:52,650
[BOTH]
...kill him.

134
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,775
[TAIJU] All right, just a
little more and it'll be out.

135
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,233
[SENKU chuckles]

136
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,775
[SENKU]
If Tsukasa's after us,

137
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,858
there's a ten billion percent
chance that he'll find us.

140
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:14,942
--[SENKU] Hm?
--[TAIJU] Huh?

141
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,608
[SENKU]
A smoke signal?

142
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,817
Is it Tsukasa?

143
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,442
[SENKU] No, he's in
the opposite direction.

144
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,567
And besides, he's got
absolutely no reason

145
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,358
to reveal his
location like that.

146
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,692
So what then? A forest fire?

147
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,983
I don't believe it's
a mere coincidence.

148
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,733
The timing suggests
it's a response

149
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,358
to the smoke we created.

150
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,692
[YUZURIHA]
You mean...?

151
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,358
Indeed I do.

152
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:46,358
[SENKU] It's time to
get excited you two.

153
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,067
Because it looks like

154
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,775
we've found someone else
in this Stone World.

155
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,442
Whoa. There's more people?
We're not alone?

156
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,483
Don't you think we should
finish putting out the fire?

157
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,275
Yeah, you're right!

158
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:00,858
[SENKU]
No, hang on.

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,025
As far as they know, our smoke
could've been caused naturally

160
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,275
by a small volcanic explosion.

161
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:08,942
We need to send a signal back

162
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,900
before they decide to
give up and leave.

163
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,275
I think it get it now!

164
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:15,692
Are you sure? Won't Tsukasa
be able to see it, too?

165
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,150
We'll be broadcasting
our location to everyone,

166
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:18,983
including him.

167
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,775
[TAIJU growls]

168
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,317
[chuckles]

169
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,233
[SENKU]
The least logical part of me,

170
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:27,067
what some might call
"my gut," is talking.

171
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,900
Lighting the fire is risky.

172
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:33,275
I have to choose between
safety and our future.

173
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:36,817
What do we do, Senku?
Put it out? Or light it?

174
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,775
[SENKU growls]

175
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:42,983
Let's light it up!
Fire the smoke signal!

176
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,233
We're running outta gunpowder!

177
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,900
Grab anything that'll
burn and throw it in!

178
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:02,775
All right, I'm gonna go
get some firewood!

179
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,733
[SENKU]
This is a double-edged sword.

180
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:08,233
We're telling anybody within
sight exactly where we are.

181
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,942
And if Tsukasa's figured out
that we're making gunpowder...

182
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,192
[TSUKASA] Senku is definitely
making gunpowder.

183
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,025
That bit about the
shells tipped me off.

184
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:19,483
Check it out.

185
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,150
There are four super useful
things you can do with it.

186
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,650
I said three earlier, didn't I?

187
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,108
[TSUKASA] Senku hid one big
piece of info from me

188
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,733
because he realized I was
a potential threat.

189
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,317
Which means...

190
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
The fourth useful thing you
can do with seashells

191
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,858
is craft some kind of weapon.

192
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,900
I can guess what that is.

193
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:41,525
Producing potassium nitrate
for use in making gunpowder.

194
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,483
[TSUKASA]
There they are!

195
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,442
From early on, Senku
knew he'd need something

196
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,358
more advanced to fight me.

197
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,900
[YUZURIHA gasps]

198
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,567
[SENKU chuckles]

199
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,358
[SENKU] When one uses
science to create a weapon,

200
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:21,025
that's when the "strongest" man
is no longer the most powerful.

201
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:24,233
I'd say you're looking
especially grumpy today.

202
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,983
Tsukasa.

203
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:30,858
Yeah. I suppose that is an
accurate way of putting it.

204
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,775
If you go down this road
of developing weapons

205
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,733
and start reviving
older generations,

206
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,317
they'll begin fighting over
established interests,

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,692
and then we'll be right
back in a tainted world.

208
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,150
I don't mind getting
my hands dirty,

209
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,567
if that's what it takes to
stop that from happening.

210
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,817
And by that,

211
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,358
you mean killing Senku
the Science Man, right?

212
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,317
[chuckles]

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,608
I'm sure the whole world
would be moved to tears

214
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,817
by your merciful death sentence.

215
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,775
But before that, would you
mind giving me the recipe

216
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:04,775
for the revival fluid?

217
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,067
[growls]

218
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,233
Nope, sorry. I guess I'm
not as kind as you are.

219
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,858
I can only look at things
as being logical or illogical.

220
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:21,900
So, I don't care one millimeter
what you do with that girl.

221
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,192
There are plenty of
other females to revive.

222
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,733
[gasps]

223

[gasps]

224

[TSUKASA]
Don't try to negotiate, Senku.

225
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,900
[TSUKASA sighs]

226
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:37,025
[TSUKASA] You never buried
Yuzuriha, like you should've.

227
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,525
Your best move would've
been to take her

228
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:39,942
while she was still
covered in stone

229
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,525
and put her deep in
the ground somewhere.

230
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,442
In a place I couldn't find her.

231
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,692
And if I thought of that,
there's no chance in hell

232
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,817
it never crossed your mind.

233
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,275
But for some reason,
you didn't do it.

234
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:56,650
Was it for Taiju's sake,
or for Yuzuriha's?

235
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,983
No. I think it was
for both of them.

236
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,483
[gasps]

237
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,067
[growls]

238
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:05,650
[TSUKASA]
You call yourself logical,

239
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:09,025
but you have your precious
friends to care for.

240
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,817
I always had tons of admirers,

241
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,150
but there's no one I'd truly
say is precious to me.

242
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:19,317
And because of that...
this is my win.

243
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,942
[YUZURIHA chuckles]

244
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,150
[YUZURIHA] I really
appreciate the haircut.

245
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,233
It'll be a lot easier to
care for in this world.

246
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:36,442
[YUZURIHA] Please, don't give
him the recipe, Senku.

247
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,025
As long as he doesn't know
how to make it himself,

248
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,567
he'll have no choice
but to let you live.

249
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,358
He can't kill you.

250
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,817
I'm not important at all.

251
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,983
But you? You have to survive,
for everybody's sake.

252
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,317
To make sure they have a future.

253
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,858
[chuckles]

254
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,942
[SENKU] The revival fluid
is a combination

255
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,358
of nitric acid and alcohol.

256
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:20,233
First, you gotta filter the
miracle fluid from the cave,

257
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,275
then mix it up with alcohol
that's been distilled

258
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,983
to as close as 96%
as you can get it.

259
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:30,150
The ratio is 30% miracle
fluid to 70% alcohol,

260
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,775
and if you're off by
just a few points,

261
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,733
the reaction won't happen.

262
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:35,358
So you should fine-tune
it by testing it

263
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,650
on a petrified swallow feather.

264
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:44,608
Thank you so much, Senku.

265
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:48,983
And now, I no longer have
any reason to let you live.

266
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,650
Good. I think this
should be enough.

267
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,442
[gasping]

268
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,817
[screams]

269
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,942
Now there's three smoke signals!

270
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,858
[TAIJU] They must be
responding to the three shots

271
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,733
we fired with the gunpowder.

00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:09,942
There's no doubt about it.
We're not the only ones here!

273
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:14,108
Senku! Yuzuriha!

00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:20,983
[WOMAN]
Three.

275
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,942
Let's say I did let
you live, right?

276
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:36,567
You would develop
civilization just like before.

277
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,067
Can you promise that
you won't do that?

278
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,483
[SENKU chuckles]

279
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,317
[SENKU]
The hell are you talking about?

280
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,025
I could promise anything
to stay alive.

281
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:50,275
No. You would never lie.
Not when it comes to science.

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,067
So will you promise me, here
and now, and for all eternity,

283
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,317
that you'll abandon science?

284
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:06,817
Because if you can make
that pledge, you can live,

285
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,567
and then I won't be
forced into killing you.

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,192
[TEACHER A]
All right, next up is Senku.

287
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,358
I'm going to space.

288

[CLASSMATES]
Huh?

289
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,692
So an astronaut, then?

290
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,817
That's an excellent
dream, young man.

291
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,067
Work hard, and when
you grow up---

292
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,942
No. I'm going there
as soon as possible.

293

[SENKU chuckles]

294
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,733
Then again, I'm just a
kid who doesn't know

295
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,817
the first thing about science.

296
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,775
[SENKU]
I'm gonna need to study.

297
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,733
Every last thing.

298
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,108
I'm gonna try everything.

299
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,192
[gasps]

300
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,317
[SENKU'S FATHER]
I can't help you all that much.

301
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,150
But if you're serious,

302
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,608
I firmly believe that you
can accomplish anything

303
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,525
through the diligent
application of science.

304
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:04,275
[SENKU'S FATHER] I've got a
feeling that this Christmas,

305
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,858
Santa Claus will give you
all the tools you'll need.

306
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,067
[SENKU]
Hm?

307
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,942
[gasps]

308
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,650
So you can burn things
with the point of light

309
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,233
from a magnifying glass.

310
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,942
What an adorable
little scientist.

311
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:28,817
[SENKU laughs]

312
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,525
Iron sand and aluminum
foil are awesome!

313
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,442
The thermite reaction is
melting the frying pan.

314
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,692
Not sure that's adorable.

315

00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,817
at ten billion percent at
a normal temperature,

317
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,817
but freezes when too cold.

318
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,483
I'll keep trying
with ethanol for now

319
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,692
until I switch to kerosene.

320
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,858
[ALL]
Huh?

321
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:53,942
[ALL chuckle]

322
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:54,483
[SENKU]
Huh?

323
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,567
[TAIJU]
Huh?

324
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,817
[SENKU screams]

325
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,192
[yelling]

326
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,525
[STUDENT C]
Huh?

327
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,733
[SENKU screaming]

328
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,775
[STUDENT C]
Huh?

329
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:18,233
[STUDENTS screaming]

330
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,567
[TAIJU]
Hey, what's that?

331
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,025
This thing's an ablator.

332
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:24,067
It keeps the chamber
from burning up.

333
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,983
[BOTH screaming]

334
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,567
[TAIJU]
Just a few things, sir.

335
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,733
A raspberry Pi, and a
transmitter module,

336
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,858
and something called a "gyro."

337
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,442
[TAIJU]
Huh?

338
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,983
[TAIJU]
Huh?

339
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,275
For the receiver,
we'll use a Yagi antenna.

340
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,692
Like on an old TV.

341
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:54,817
Whoa!

342
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,317
[TAIJU]
Yo, Senku!

343
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,942
Didn't you say you
wanted to test it out

344
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,525
with a light payload?

345
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,400
Well, I got some help
from Ogawa Yuzuriha.

346
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,733
Check it out.

347
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,442
She used her crafts club
skills and made us these.

348
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,775
[YUZURIHA] To be honest,
it's actually kinda embarrassing

349
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,317
to have a doll of myself.

350
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,067
So what are you gonna do
with these guys anyway?

351
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:28,900
[panting]

352
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,275
Exploded at high altitude.

353
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,483
We failed again?

354
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,858
[SENKU]
Heh. No, not entirely.

355
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,233
[BOTH gasp]

356
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,525
[SENKU]
I'm going to space.

357
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,442
As soon as possible.

358
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,858
[SENKU]
You can accomplish anything...

359
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,775
...through the diligent
application of science.

360
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:33,483
Senku, you know that I'd
rather not kill you.

361
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,442
I'll ask again.

362
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:40,067
Will you promise me,
right here and now,

363
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,442
that you'll give up on science?

364
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,358
No, I can't. I can't do that.

365
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:57,275
Of course not. I knew
that would be your answer.

366
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:58,650
[SENKU chuckles]

367
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,900
Now don't go givin'
me that crap.

368
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,358
No matter what I said,

369
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,358
we both know that you were
gonna kill me at some point.

370
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,192
You'd find a reason.

371
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,483
[TSUKASA]
Maybe.

372
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,650
Just kill me in one blow.

373
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,942
Because leaving me
to suffer till I die

374
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,567
is both illogical
and inefficient.

375
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,733
Don't worry, Senku.

376
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:24,942
I'm going to sever
your cervical nerve.

377
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,150
It'll be instantaneous.

378
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:30,442
You'll be knocked unconscious
and die without suffering.

379
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:31,942
I won't miss.

380
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,400
[gasps]

381
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:34,775
[YUZURIHA]
Taiju.

382
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,817
Something's wrong.

383
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
I gotta get back, now!

384
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,900
Senku, I have a feeling

385
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:49,483
that if we had met each
other 3,700 years ago,

386
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,150
before all this,

387
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:55,317
before the planet was turned
into a Stone World...

388
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,067
...I think that you might've
been my first real friend.

389
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,983
Maybe.

390
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:08,233
[yelling]

391
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:15,983
Senku!
