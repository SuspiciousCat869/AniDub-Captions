Hm?

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
Now, there's a sight
for sore eyes.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
Nothin' says "spring"
quite like this.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. Uzaki, right?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
That's right! Hana Uzaki!

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.999 position:50% align:center
Ha! Hi!

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
I'm your under-classman! Again.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Wait.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me that you
don't swim for the college?

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not. I mean, they don't
even have a swim club, so...

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
But you worked so hard
at it in high school.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
It's cool.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
There's a ton of other awesome
stuff to do in college.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.318 position:50% align:center
I bet.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
Well, guess I'll find out soon!

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.865 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Little did I realize...

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.868 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Is he...

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
...sleeping?

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.337 position:50% align:center
What the what...?

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
No, seriously, what?

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
What in the actual what?

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Let's be real.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
I kind of assumed the year
might turn out like this.

Sakurai!

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
Whoa! I overshot ya! Ha, ha.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.335 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.463 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, hi. Uzaki, right?

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
All alone again, I see.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to
hang out with you, then!

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
Your college-loner lifestyle
is officially ending today!

[FEMALE STUDENT A]
What's up for lunch?

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Uh. The Dining hall, I guess.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
[MALE STUDENT A]
Hey, is it cool if we join?

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
Wow. Canceled.
Guess my afternoon's wide open.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] No work today, either.
What to do...?

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT C yelps]
What was with that glare?

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
He's scary.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll just bum around
on my own for once. 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's like I can't
even get any quiet time

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
now that she shows up
every five minutes.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
[exhales]
What am I always telling you?

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for you to yell--

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles]

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
Well, I called you
over and over,

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
but you weren't hearing me!

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
So, what's up?
Where are ya goin'?

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
Uzaki, seriously, what the
hell is wrong with you?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
Huh? Nothing!

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you headed to lunch?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, that's too bad.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
My friends and I
actually already ate.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
But if you insist, I could
always come along

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
to keep you company and watch
you eat. How's that sound?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
I've got no classes
this afternoon.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
I was just taking a little
stroll around campus.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
Uzaki. Is there a reason
you're following me?

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Yikes, look at that face!

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
Well, as it turns out,

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
I'm suddenly available
this afternoon, too!

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
Given half the chance,

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
I know you tend to default
to being a loner.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
But, c'mon, two has got to be
way more fun than one!

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
Not your business.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center
Besides, I've told you
a million times,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
I happen to find quiet time
alone much more relaxing.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
Here we go again.
Being a loner is no fun!

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Don't call me that.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's right!

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
You're actually not a loner,
because I'm here with you now!

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
Quit tagging along,
you damn pest!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Are ya nervous?

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What? No!

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well, then. Where are we going?

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Not telling.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Bowling? Karaoke?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Forget it.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Aw, c'mon, spill it!

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What's with you?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
Why're you being so rude today?

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm in the mood.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
In the mood?!

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
What's the deal? We've hung
out before, so why not now?

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Treating me differently
depending on your mood?

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
It must be so convenient
that you can get with me

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
when you feel like it and
otherwise it's bye-bye!

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
Can you please
watch your phrasing

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
when there are other
people around?

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT E]
What a jerk!

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT F]
Utter trash.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[MALE STUDENT B]
Dude.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine, I suck!
Come on, let's go.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Woo-hoo!

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, once we're done here,

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
what do you say
we get some food?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
I'd totally be down to join you
for dinner if you want me to.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm not paying.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Freakin' cheapskate.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Why? You tryin'
to mooch or what?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're kidding me.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
Were you really gonna see
a movie by yourself today?

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
Sure. Why not?

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Solo date!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
Tsk! What's so funny?

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're that guy!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's a
prime loner move!

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
It's right up there with
going solo at a water park

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
or a sushi buffet!

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
Ha! I can't!

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
Why don't you ever shut up?

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
You're gonna start making
enemies everywhere you go.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
At the very least, you could
bring it down a notch.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
Listen, this is the
"live and let live " era.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
We're all free to find
time in our busy day

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
to see the movie we
want the way we want.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
Right. Sure.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
Seriously, shouldn't we
all spend our free time

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
however we choose to?

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Don't laugh at other
people's hobbies

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
just cuz they're not yours.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'kay.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
Plenty of people treat movies
just like any other pastime.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Not everyone makes a
big deal about whether

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
someone's in the
seat next to them.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
That's just how it is.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
Totally get it.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
Spoken like a true loner!

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Give me the strength
to keep it together.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center
Going to a movie whenever
one feels like it

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
doesn't make one a loner.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
The scheduling alone is a hassle
with more people in the mix.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a fair point.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
The main bummer, though,
is that you can't talk spoilers

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
with your friends really loudly
afterwards when you go alone!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
Okay, you know that's, like,
one of the worst possible

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
things you can do as a
human being, right?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
Say no more. I get it. I do.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
You're just determined
to soldier on

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
despite your
desperate loneliness.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you've
figured me out.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I knew I shouldn't
have brought you.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
Well, it wouldn't have mattered,

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
cuz I'd follow you all
sneaky-like, anyway.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI groans]

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
You are so messed up.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
I guess that's really
your idea of fun?

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
It'd be all kinds of
hilarious if I spotted you

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
buying something embarrassing
in some weird store!

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
I know I'd laugh myself
silly if I saw you

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
picking out dirty
DVDs or whatever!

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
Owie, that hurts, stop that!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
Sakurai!

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.078 position:50% align:center
Uncle, uncle, uncle!

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
Uncle, uncle, uncle! Ugh!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] College students
are actual adults,

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
so no more mean-girl mocking
of people's hobbies

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
or digging into
their private lives!

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I'm sorry!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
Finally.

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able to
pick which movie to see

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
with you all up in my business.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans] Hold on, you came
without a movie in mind?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
Well, it was a
last-minute thing.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
Besides, choosing here is one
of the thrills of solo movies.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] If there's one
you wanna see, I'll pay.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
Really? What about
your solo movie?

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's not, like,
a rule that I have to go solo.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
And actually, with you here,

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll see
something different.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
Anyway. I figure my reward
points will cover the two of us.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Seriously?

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
Well, if you say so, then I'll
totally let you treat! Thanks!

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
How about...

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
This! What a bargain!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's heroes as
far as the eye can see,

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
so we really can't lose!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's a great one.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I saw it once, but I was
thinking of seeing it again.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool!

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Two students, please.
I'll use my points.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
Yes, certainly.
I'd be happy to help you.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well, she has her moments,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
but she still makes me crazy.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
She seems happy, though,
so I guess I can do this much.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm-hm.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, by the way.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
Heh...

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
It's interesting that you've
apparently seen enough

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
solo movies to pay for
someone else's ticket!

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
Definitely screams
"winner," you know?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI growls]

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Dammit! You would say
that after I've already paid!

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You've reached,
like, pro-level loner!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, what's happening?

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
Are you--

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I'm kidding! Jeez! Sorry!

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[MALE PATRON A] Sheesh.
Will that couple ever shut up?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Stop it, will you!

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Gee, thanks, that was so great!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
Yeah. A good film's
always worth a re-watch.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
And I managed to zap all
those points you banked

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
going to movies alone
in a single day!

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
That's your standard
for "great"?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
I guess the "nice" portion of
the afternoon's officially over.

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Oh, hey, would you
mind if we stop by

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
the electronics store?
I need some new earbuds.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, sure.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles] See?
We're getting along just fine!

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So weird.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
What is it about this sorta
shop that makes me think,

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
"Since I'm here, I should
definitely buy something"?

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Score.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
Look! You gotta check this out!

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Get over here!

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
And what about your earbuds?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Sit down and try it,
the next seat's open!

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Do you ever listen?

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
Guess a massage might not
be bad after a movie.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
That's correct! It works great.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
I'm obsessed.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm. Oh, yeah. This is nice.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
Told ya! Though with me,

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
my shoulders need the action
instead of my back.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh yeah?

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI moans]

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]
Okay, where did that come from?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I know, sorry. Ah!

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
I gotta make noise
when it's good!

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
My shoulders have always
been super tight.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
The relief is almost
too much to bear!

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
I mean, I get it, but...

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
When you, ya'know,
sound like that...

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI moans] I would buy this
in a second if I had the money.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
It's just... Oh wow...
Oh my gosh.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
So good!

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
[moaning continues]

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
'Kay! I think it's time to go!

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] That wasn't even
a full five minutes!

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Just stop. Save all
that stuff for home!

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
When you're alone.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
Wait, save what?

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
Geez, this weirdo.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
Making those kinds of
noises in a public place.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, looky over here!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, what now?

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
Apparently, if you stand
on this thing for ten minutes,

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
it's like getting
a whole workout!

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
Pretty awesome, right?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
Hop on! Give it a try!

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
Please, Sakurai!

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Wah...

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI yells] Oh, my God!
Why are you like this?

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Check out that exhibit!

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI groans]
Fine, what is it this time?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Are you kidding? It's VR!

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
VR!

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh. Virtual reality, huh?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
Well, would either of you
like to give it a try?

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Yes, please!
Very-much-thank-you!

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
Hey. Wha...? Whoa!

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
I can see, like,
everything around me!

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Okay, we get it, can you
keep your voice down?

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
[ZOMBIES groan]

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Ammo! I'm outta ammo!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
Crap! Zombies!

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
I sure hope no one's
behind you...

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Behind me? Ah!

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Agh! Get back!

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
Your reactions are
kind of the best.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
They should really consider
putting you in a commer--

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI groans]

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]
They got me!

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
Wow, VR is the best
invention ever!

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, sir.
Are you all right?

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]
Okay, what have I done now?

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, ma'am, but would
your boyfriend like a turn?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
I'm not her boyfriend.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
But... okay.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer something
less dangerous.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps] I can't get
over these ocean graphics.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
They're amazing!

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.553 position:50% align:center
Bonus: You look like
a regular person

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
with those goggles cuz they
hide your bad-guy face!

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Shut up, stupid.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
Whoa! It's a giant shark!

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Wait, is it coming this way?

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It is? Oh crap!

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's biting me!
It's totally biting me!

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
I'm dead!

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]
You're completely freaking out!

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
You're one to talk!

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI shouts]

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'm gonna go ahead
and get this little meltdown

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
on video so I can tease
you about it later!

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
Uh, miss?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
You should be careful not to
get too close to the player.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm? What's this?

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
Jellyfish? Sunfish? It's big
and soft and kinda scary!

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Wow, I've never thought much
of VR, but this was pretty cool!

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
It even reproduces touch!
That was incredible!

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
I'll be fine.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
You said VR made you want
to do something physical

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
and now all you're doing
is swinging that bat,

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
lookin' stupid, and racking
up a pile of strikes!

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
You gotta focus!

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
Would you please shut up?

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Here comes the
next one! You can do it!

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Knock it out of the park!
Home run!

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's enough outta you!

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Not even close
to being a fair ball!

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI isghs] You're just...
You're the friggin' worst.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
You said you'd done this before
but you totally haven't,

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
am I right?

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Dammit, you really know
how to tick me off.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
Fine. I played for one
year in junior high.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Whatevs! I wanna try, too!

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Here's my card.
There's still some on there.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Thanks!

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
Don't stand too close or the
ball will seriously hit you.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
How 'bout if I hit a home run,
then dinner's on you?

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Eyes forward!
Ya wanna get hurt?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay. Plant the feet.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
Swivel the hips.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
Oh, dude, like the real deal.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
Wa-- Hold on a sec, did you--

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Did you stretch first?

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
[cracking]

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]
It hurts.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What do you expect?

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
You must be nuts, whipping out
a full swing like that!

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
Now, turn over!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
I think I heard a big pop.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, I'll say!

00:17:56.409 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
All I did was copy you...
And look where it got me.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
A novice can't start off putting
their hips into a full swing!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
Of course you
hurt yourself, dummy!

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
This is all your fault.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
This excruciating
pain is on you.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
I don't think so.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Go home and
try to get some sleep.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
And see a doctor tomorrow.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
But... before any of that...

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
I wanna go get dinner!

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Jeez, do you ever give up?

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, SAKURAI]
Let's eat!

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Well, you seem to be able
to walk fine on your own,

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
so it's probably nothing
serious after all.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
If it still hurts tomorrow,
see a doctor.

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
And you really should head
home now and get some rest.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry, I'll survive.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
You don't get
much exercise, do you?

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
That injury is solid proof
you haven't been very active.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gulps] Well, what the
heck did you expect?

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
I'm only a beginner!

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's right, and as a novice,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
you need to be
careful to warm up.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
Back injuries are nothin'
to mess around with.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]
All right.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You realize that
never would've happened

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't elbowed your
way into tagging along.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Isn't that...
my chicken?

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
Hey. Why're you
demolishing my nuggs?

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You ate all of them?!

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Eh?

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
I mean... are we not sharing?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
First off, we're not!

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
And second, how is it sharing
when you eat the whole plate?

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You can keep it!

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A laughs]

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Your girlfriend has her
hands full with you,

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
doesn't she, Mr. Temper?

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's not my girlfriend.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
Could I, uh, get another
order of chicken, please?

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A]
Coming up!

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh,
your chicken's so good,

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
it's like my chopsticks just
kept going and I couldn't stop!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A]
Glad to hear that, miss!

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
And now she's Miss
Sunny Personality.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A] Here you go!
On the house. Eat up!

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
Wow, are you serious?

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, we couldn't do that!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A laughs]
Go on, enjoy!

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Mm! It's delish!

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
Honestly?

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
Hey, get in here.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
It's kinda rude not to accept
the chef's kindness!

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
Okay, don't mind if I--

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me with this?
You ate it all?

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it was an accident!

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
[MALE COOK A] Here you go!
'Nother order-a chicken.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Never again!

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm.

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
I had a lot of fun yesterday!

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
What? All you accomplished
was hurting your back.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it had to be fun
going for a whole day

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
without being a loner, right?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I think I made it
clear from the very beginning

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
that I had no problem
spending the day by myself.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at you pretending
you're not happy.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Watch it.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
I've never been to a batting
cage with my girlfriends before,

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
so that was definitely a new
and exciting experience for me!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
I need you to teach me
how to swing soon, okay?

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
Because, next time, I really
wanna send it flying!

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
Hey, how 'bout we
go again today?

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
I can't, I have work.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
Aw. Oh well, we'll do
it next time!

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
"Next time," huh?

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs] This little
freak doesn't let pain get

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
in the way of having fun, I've
gotta hand it to her for that.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I wonder when it was
that she became... this way.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
Like this? Or more like this?

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well, I won't be bored.

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
I can put up with her
for a while, I guess.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Yeah, next time, for sure.

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Uh, Sakurai?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You know that
thing we did yesterday?

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
Oh, my back still hurts!
It's all your fault, you know.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center
Phrasing!

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'm not kidding.
I mean, it even hurts to walk!

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
You should carry me!
C'mon, please!

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Shut up!

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:48.219 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Next time,
we'll meet the café owner!
