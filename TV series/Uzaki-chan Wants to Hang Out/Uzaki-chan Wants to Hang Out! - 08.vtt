That crazy girl.

to go drinking with me

Actually, we both did, which
wasn't very

train of the night.

Continue.

So--and maybe it's because
we were both tipsy,

Hm. Interesting.

it into her head

that whatever she did

the better.

Aren't you hungry?

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
Well... I did swim a lot.

Thank you.

apologize to you, though.

Yeah, but not for long.

[UZAKI] Hey! No getting
up for you, mister!

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
The nice person who
helped me carry you said

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
that even if you're awake, you
really ought to stay lying down

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
for as long as you can.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
Ah. Okay.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Whoa.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Whoa! Maybe it's
because my line of sight

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
is blocked but, damn,
something smells great.

Yeah?

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
Like, a thousand times sorry.

[SAKURAI]
It's fine, really.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
Besides, this was
an accident, right?

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Plus, I got a little
carried away, myself.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
But I...

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Don't sweat it, 'kay?

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
All right. Understood.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Man. She'd only just
bounced back, and now this.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Not that I can see it, but I bet
she's making that face again.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah. It's the same
face she made back then, too.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
It's like Ami and her dad said.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
She's thinking about
the way things look.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
But when it's her
making that face?

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
I guess it's only natural that
things would feel a little off.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uzaki, listen.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] When you started
at our college last year,

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
it honestly didn't occur to
me that we might end up

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
hanging out.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
I never would've guessed.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But look at us.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
You started getting really
buddy-buddy with me last spring

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
and you were stubborn
as hell about it.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Real talk? You seriously
got on my nerves.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Still, though.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking back,

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
about everything that's
happened so far.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
You've tagged along
everywhere I've gone.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Sometimes even intruding on my
private space and alone time.

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
But we kept hanging out.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
We went to the beach
and the cat café,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
and we even felt comfy
enough to drink together.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
And the fireworks.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
Tonight will be our
second time with those.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
Until last year,

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
I'd never done or seen so much
or gone to so many places.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong, I could
do without all the noise,

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
but when it comes
down to it, it was fun.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
I can't deny that.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
What's more.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
You know I hate to say it.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
But it's probably a hundred
percent thanks to you

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
that I've been able to get used
to being social and stuff.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
I think you've opened
me up a bit.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:50.417 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is,
keep being yourself.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
Don't try to be different.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
It messes things up.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center

Sakurai.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center

some summer break left.

on your loner summer break,

It sure has.

see the fireworks from there?

Just barely.

I'm just fine right here.
