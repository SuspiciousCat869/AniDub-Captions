[SAKURAI]
Let's get going.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.849 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What do you wanna do first?

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well, let's see.
What is there in Tottori?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
No big coffee chains,
just local brews!

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
Crab rich, cash poor!
Welcome to Tottori Prefecture!

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
'Kay, that's weird.
What was with that guy?

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
Are you being serious?
You don't know?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
[GOVERNOR] No convenience
stores? No problem.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
Who needs those?
We don't got 'em.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
He's a real big shot.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] We should probably
hit the sand dunes first.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
Says here that we can paraglide
or go sandboarding!

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
Guess you like the
active stuff, huh?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
All solo activities, I noticed.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
You're going full loner
in Tottori, too!

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
And you won't shut up
no matter where we go.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
So, how're we gettin' around?

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I dunno. We'll take
the bus or something.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.273 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps, screams]

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys!

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:14.991 position:50% align:center
Yo!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Itsuhito!

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.869 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
And Ami!

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] How crazy that
you're both here, too!

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
Dad wanted me to take a
summer break. And then...

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of taking a trip
when she ran into me

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
and suggested meeting
up with you two here.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
Seemed like a plan.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
I'll say! I feel bad, though.
You guys renting a car and all.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Nah, totally fine.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
You have a thoughtful
side, Sakaki!

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
That's a terrific trait.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
The rest of you is iffy,
but at least there's that.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
Please, enough with
the compliments!

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
Wasn't really a compliment.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] It's definitely more
efficient to travel by car,

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's cushier than I imagined.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Right? A rental car is
a must if you want real freedom.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Spoken like a seasoned traveler.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
You know me!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
So went our story.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
But our trip here
serves another purpose.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
That's right. Hana and Sakurai,

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
vacationing alone together.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
I want their relationship
to be untouched

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
by other hands, but even
I couldn't stay away!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] We've been watching
over their progress thus far

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
and it's right on track. We have
a duty to see this through.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
And we get front-row seats!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
What a treat! Not to mention
a trip to Tottori.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Pure coincidence,
of course, but should be fun.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] These two still don't
even know the <i>real</i> Tottori!

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]
A convenience store.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hey, yeah!
So, they do have them.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
They really are spectacular
in person, aren't they?

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Man, what
a beautiful sight!

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE A] The sand dunes measure
2.4 kilometers, north to south.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
Sixteen kilometers east to west.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
Most people don't realize
they're the largest sand dunes

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
in Japan that are actually
accessible to people.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
The dune right in front there
is called the Horse's Back.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
It measures about
50 meters high.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
It's a popular tourist spot
because from its peak,

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
you can see the all of the dunes

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
and take in amazing views
of the Japan Sea.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI laughs]
Whoa, nice!

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Heh!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakurai! What do you
say we race to the water?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
You're on!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] If I win, you owe me
a nashi pear fro-yo!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] And if I win,
you owe me a coffee ice cream!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
Okay, ready... set...

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Go!

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI yells]

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
[gasping] The sand really grabs
the feet. This is rough!

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
Suddenly regretting these shoes!

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's up, bud?

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Hey! What the heck is that?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
A sandboard, just like
you were talking about!

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
I decided to reserve
one for myself!

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
That's not fair!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
Ha! Whatever!

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
You know that a contest begins
way before it starts!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
Catch ya on the flip side!

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
Dammit!

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
Might as well give up,
'cause you'll never catch me!

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Cheater! Hold it right there!

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI panting]

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI yells]

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasping]

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I win, you loser.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] A competition against
this beautiful backdrop?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
Seriously, have you no soul?

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
I admit, I admire your nerve,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
whining about losing
when it was your idea.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
Still, it really is beautiful.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Makes our race seem
kind of insignificant.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI panting]
So, I don't owe you, then?

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Nah, you do.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
[AKKYUN] Excuse me!
Could you take our picture?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, sure.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
[MIHO]
Thanks so much!

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Tottori!

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI chuckles nervously]

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
[AKKYUN]
We appreciate it!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ooxy-pie, you look
so cool in this shot!

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
And you are so cute, Miho-Miho!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]
Okay, shall we?

00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]
But I can't walk.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
Oh, fine then, you win.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, somehow, I still
have some strength left.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
It's so round!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
Japan's oldest circular
school building,

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
originally a primary school.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
Allow me to tell you about it.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
The structure used
to be dilapidated,

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
and it was due to be torn down.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
But the citizens who
wanted it to remain

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
spurred the officials
into action.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
And so the building was
reborn as a museum!

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
Now it has various
local specialties

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
on display for your pleasure.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
Regional specialties, huh?

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
What, like nashi pears?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
Can't forget Matsuba
snow crabs.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[ASAI laughs]

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
Look at these figurines!

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and the Nendoroids, too.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE A]
Tottori is the Manga Prefecture,

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center
the birthplace of
many manga artists,

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
and it's home to a terrific
figurine factory, as well!

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
In other words,
manga and figurines

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
are indeed local
Tottori specialties!

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps] I'm starting
to get that feeling, yes.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] I could hang
around here all day!

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
Oh, these are adorable!

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, wanna buy me
something as a souvenir?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Seriously?
You're getting four?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
They look like four sisters,
so I don't wanna separate them!

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
Oh! Come on! Different versions!
Double or nothin'!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
Okay, I vote nothing!

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
See, it's written
using the characters

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
"three" and "morning,"
isn't that clever?

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
'Kay, see you later.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Yep.

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI chuckles]

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, SAKURAI scream]

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
Phew, I am beat.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] We did a ton of
running around today.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
I mean, you could've finally
shared a room with Sakurai!

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, though.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
That was your chance!
What are you doing, dude?

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
Look, I've already told you,
it's not like that with us.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Hey.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
But it will be. Soon.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
That's not true. I'm not...

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
Whatever, you're
just wrong, okay?

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakurai! Wanna go
with me to the steam bath?

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uhh...

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
[shutter clicks]

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Don't you dare!

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE A] Here at Misasa Hot
Spring, the waters are for

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
soaking, drinking,
and breathing in deeply.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Inhaling the mist in this
luxurious steam bath

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
is certain to cure whatever
ails you from the inside out.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
If you inhale enough of it,

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
I bet it'll even heal
your big, mean face.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool. Better get
breathing, then.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
By the way, shut up.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Pretty half-hearted
comeback there, Sakurai.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
Probably too hot to think
of anything better.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wow, you're sweating buckets.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
It's never-ending, uhh...

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, can I use your towel?

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
I don't know.
Just how sweaty are you?

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I'm like a freakin' faucet.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
Uh, your towel, please?

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI groaning]

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Oh, gross, you're
super damp and sticky!

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're not
helping that, dammit!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
Would you get off me?

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]
Hey, that tickles!

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well, sorry but you're
gonna to have to deal with it!

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Ah! Not there! Move your hand!

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
Please save that for
the privacy of your room!

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.853 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What?

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This is great!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
Especially after
sweating so much.

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Man, I was soaking wet!

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
But Sakurai wouldn't even let
me use his towel, the turd.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
He is so inconsiderate!

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Who are you
calling inconsiderate?

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] What, are you spying
on us now? Coupla pervs!

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Ah, shut up.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
Surely, all that sweating
must have flushed

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
the bad stuff outta you,

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
so have you considered trying
to go live a productive life?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
I really think it's worth
your consideration.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
"Bad stuff"?
What does that mean?

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
You should say that
into a mirror,

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
Mr. Villain-faced
Loner Introvert!

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] If only you'd
been able to sweat out

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
your annoyingness, too.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
That would've been great!

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
How are they still like this?

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
What an unsexy conversation.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
That butthead.
Know what? Fine!

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Let's see which one of us
is worse, once and for all!

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
Oh, you are so on!

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
Gotcha...

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles]

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI growls]

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
What the heck?
They're just not going in.

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] All right, I think
I've got the hang of it.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
I can totally win this thing.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hey, why don't you put
those extra balls in this box?

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Now, to win.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
--Watch yourself!
--[UZAKI] Tch.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
Come on, hurry up! Stop lagging!

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's not a race.
To me, at least.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
Well, you better make it snappy
or you're gonna lose, mister!

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You're a tyrant.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
A whole vacay and
nothing's changed.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's all right.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
Those two are plenty tasty
enough just as they are.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Mmm...
Are they really, though?

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
A frog! What's this here for?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
Dunno.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
A matchmaking <i>kajika</i> frog?

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] "Rub to make your
dream match come true."

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
Guess they are pretty tasty,
aren't they?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
So good. Thank you for
the bounteous feast.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] We have to finish
with this place!

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Sakurai!
Check out all these <i>yokai</i> !

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Some I know,
but some I've never seen.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
One hundred and
seventy-seven bronze <i>yokai.</i>

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
Spread out over the
800 meters of this street,

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
which leads directly
to Sakaiminato Station.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Almost 200?
That's pretty amazing!

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
Check it out! What's this?

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
It looks like a dragon to me.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Let's see... It's not!
It's a <i>shiro-uneri</i> !

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.954 position:50% align:center
Shiro. What now?

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay, next! What's this?

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
A crayfish?

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Err! An <i>amikiri</i> !

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
These are tough. What's next?

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
This, right here!

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
A yeti!

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
<i>Keukegen</i> !

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
What's this "yeti" stuff?
That's not even Japanese.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Dammit. You try this next one.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
Here. Wait, this is--

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
<i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> ! It's <i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> !

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I knew that one!

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI screaming]

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay, moving on!

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Yep, this is the place.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] The Mizuki Shigeru
Museum is a must-see.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI, ASAI gasp]

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.137 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hey. There's my name for once.
