00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I can't hang out
with you anymore.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasping]

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
It's just... I did it again.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
I've done something
that can't be undone.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
Wait, calm down and tell me
what's going on. Okay?

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
I would, but I don't
want to be a bother.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
You're being ridiculous
and you know it!

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
If there's any way I can
help out, I will.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Maybe!

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
Would you seriously do anything?

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
Well, within reason.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Ugh, what's with that
weird face, though?

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
As it turns out I haven't even
touched that big report

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
I had for homework
over the summer break

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
and now I'm totally screwed!

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.389 position:50% align:center
I know! It's the same
problem as last year!

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
So dumb!

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
Why do they give us
summer homework, anyway?

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
I'll never understand why they
insist on torturing us students!

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
Now my mom is
super-pissed, of course,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
and my little brother's
teasing me hardcore--

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
it's awful!

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
Did you seriously just
close the door on me?!

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center
Look, if you wanna
keep hanging out

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
till the end of the summer,

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
then you gotta help me
with my report!

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
No way! You can go
do it yourself!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.704 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, c'mon! Please? Sakurai!

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
I can't, I hate it,
let me in, please?

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.459 position:50% align:center
Good grief. She's hopeless.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER laughing]

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
Yes, that sounds
like Hana, all right.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's honestly
not funny anymore.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50% align:center
She's getting more
comfortable by the day.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
For real, I think she must've
been hiding her claws

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
back when we
were in high school.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI meows]

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.444 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Interesting.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Oh, here. Let me
handle the heavy stuff.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
Come on. This is nothing.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER screams]

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEES]
Boss!

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Ah. Aw, you threw out your back?

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
That hasn't happened in a while.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
Yes. I think we'll
close for the day.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
This one is bad. I need
the chiropractor.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
Right. Looks like we
don't have much choice.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
Who here has a driver's license?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] I'm making my Dad an
appointment at the clinic.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
Would you mind taking him?
You can use our car.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, Hana,
you and I will close up.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
Yep, we got it.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Or, actually...

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
I could always try being
acting-manager for the day.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER grunts] I'm not sure
how much of your fervor

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
the customers could take.
Shut it down.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
Thanks for helping me
close up the shop.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
Here, on the house.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you! I was thirsty.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
How does it compare
to my Dad's brew?

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
It's good!

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
I do appreciate the depth
of flavor in his coffee.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
But I really like the fresh
taste of yours, too.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
So, hey, will you inherit
the café from him one day?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd like to
inherit it, for sure.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
Unless... I take it first.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] 'Kay, that seemed
unnecessarily threatening.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
But I doubt that'll be
happening anytime soon.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
There's so much
I still need be able

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
to run a successful business.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
I could definitely use a
driver's license, for starters.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness Sakurai
was around today.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
We got lucky.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]
Yeah, it's true.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
Classic Sakurai:
surly but accommodating.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
You've made good
use of him here.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
He's not a tool, Hana. Huh?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hm? What did I say?

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
[ASAI laughs]
It's nothing. So tell me.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
What were you and our dear
Sakurai like in high school?

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
You were in the swim club
together, weren't you?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
Did you used to flirt--er,
hang out, like you do now?

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
Ohh... No, the funny thing is,

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
we actually only
started hanging out

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
a little while after
we started college.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
Huh! That's kinda surprising.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
We only saw each other for
club business in high school.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
Even the first time we met,

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
it was, uh... club-related.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.968 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What? The swim club?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
I feel about that.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
I've never been
much of a swimmer.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
No, you could be a manager!

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
You're not in any club yet,
right? We can both join!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Plus, I know some
cute third-years

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
in it from middle
school! Please!

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50% align:center
Um, I'll have to think about it.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A] Stop thinking.
I'm too chicken to go alone!

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
Listen up!

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
We have two new first-year
managers joining us today.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
You guys look
after them, got it?

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
[MALE TEAMMATES cheering]

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN]
That's enough--cut it out.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
As you can see, we've got
a pretty big roster here.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
It won't be easy,
but do your best.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
This is one of our
third-year managers

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
and I've asked her
to show you the ropes.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
All yours.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Cap!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Welcome, girls!

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
--Thanks for having us.
--Thank you for having us.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
Let me explain what
you'll be doing first.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mornin'!

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, hey, Sakurai!

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Sorry I'm late.
I was just cleanin' up.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
Look, we've got two new
first-year managers joining us.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah? That's somethin'.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nice to meet y-- [gasps]

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
What's up? Sakurai. Second year.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm gonna go warm up.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
Cool, see ya!

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] That was terrifying!
His eyes are so fierce!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
He's a freakin' student here?

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
It's my first day,
and I'm ready to quit!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
He's scary as heck! Just... No!

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
Uh. You okay?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
So, yeah. That first
impression was not the best.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Huh. You know, his eyes

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
have never really bothered
me all that much.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
No worries. 'Cause I learned
that he's a serious,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
earnest person at heart.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI panting]

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
Good job, man!
That's a new record!

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
These're kinda heavy. I got 'em.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
That's cool of you
Sakurai, thanks!

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
Go for the record! Come on!
You can do this, dude!

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Aren't you hungry?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
He just seems so awkward.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
And prone to misunderstandings.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
I realized pretty quickly
that my instincts

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
had been wrong and he
wasn't scary in the least.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
So, then, you got friendlier
and friendlier as time passed.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
You even sound like him now.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You know,

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
you're a little more sincere
than you used to be.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
Do you really not see how
you've softened up a bit

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
since you've been hanging out?

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasping]

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
I'll be on my way!

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
That's enough reminiscing
for now! Oof!

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
Sorry, um...

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
I guess I must've touched
a nerve, there, huh?

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though,
you hadn't noticed?

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
Nope! So I'll be off! Bye!

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Crap, did I just
dig up a landmine?

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
Or the greatest treasure
chest that ever was?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Either way,
I've got to get her to talk!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Question: What's Sakurai
like when he's really drunk?

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
I just realized I've never
actually seen him

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
under the influence of anything.
I mean, does he cry? Laugh?

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
Get combative?
I can't even picture it.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
Well, in my experience,
usually a person

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
will reveal whatever
they've been holding back.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
Personally, I'd like to hope

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
he's a strip-naked
kind of drunk.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
That's personal, all right.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
Although, Sakurai can
definitely hold his liquor,

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
so maybe it never
gets the best of him.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
Look. Saku's no lightweight,
that's for sure.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
He's overdone it. It's just
that he knows his limits,

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
so I think, in general,
he tries to stick to 'em.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha! So!

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
One of those rare beasties
known as "Sakurai's friends"

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
has actually seen him
drunk in the wild!

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center
"Rare beastie friends"?
Could you not?

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
Talk! Tell me everything!

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
How much booze does
he have to put away?

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to go after
Saku while he's wasted?

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
You're gross.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
No, I just hate that he's seen
my booze-related humiliations.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to drag him
down with me, naturally.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
You've got no one to blame
for that but yourself.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
Please, Sakaki!

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect time for
scheming since he's gone,

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
we can't let it go to waste!

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Okay. Famous last words,

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
but I guess you can't
cause too much trouble.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] This should provide
quality entertainment.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Woo-hoo! Thanks, I can't wait!

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll need to plan
some kind of party.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
When's a good time?

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Given how it went
with you last time, Ami,

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
I think I'll go it alone.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Hana's mad at me!

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Fascinating. Whatever did you do

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
to make Hana shut you out,
oh daughter of mine?

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're here! Come on in.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
Yup! Right on time!

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Why'd you want
to come over for a drink

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
all of a sudden?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold up.

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] What?
I finished my report, okay?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Oh, you did?
Well, that's good.

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
Yeah! So let's go
all-out today!

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
I brought food, so I can
handle the cooking. See?

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
Getting back home is
the hard part with Saku,

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
so he rarely drinks
when he's out.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
Which means he's more likely to
lower his guard at his place.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Phase 1: check!

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Wow. You really
are a great cook, Uzaki.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Go on, eat up!

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Don't mind if I do.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
Who knew you could actually
make chili shrimp at home?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mmm... Mm! You're a total pro!

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well, that is an exaggeration.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Put out spicy snacks
with a lot of flavor

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
to keep him drinking.
And then...

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hey, I brought
some DVDs. Wanna watch?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
We've got five different
killer-shark choices!

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.011 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Keep him good and distracted

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
so he's less likely to notice

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
how many drinks
he's throwing back.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Phases two and three: check!

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
[ACTORS shouting]

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] And since Saku
tends to keep pace

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
with whoever he's with,
if you're drinking,

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.903 position:50% align:center
he'll naturally
keep drinking, too.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Pretend. Just pretend...

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Here! You ready for another one?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Thanks!

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles] And now
it's time for the main event,

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
my darling Sakurai!

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] When Saku's drunk,
he's useless.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
Meaning he can hold
a conversation,

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
but I wouldn't trust the guy
to put together a piece

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
of furniture, and he starts
looking stupidly sloppy, too.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Sloppy Saku.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
[ASAI laughs]

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
Yep, that does sound
pretty useless.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Nice for you.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
In that state, Saku can't lie,
much less try to act cool.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
His mental defenses are
basically zero at that point.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
He's big on minding his limits

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
because he's not into showing
that side of himself to anyone.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, I...

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
Hey, mister. So, is this
what it looks like

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
when you're feelin'
no pain, huh?

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunting]
Cut that out.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs] I'd never dreamed
of this level of vulnerability!

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]
Uzaki...

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's up?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
Thank you. That food was yummy.
And you cooked it.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad you think so!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
Though, I'd be even happier

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
if you could give me
your honest opinions

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
without first having to drown
yourself in tons of alcohol.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]
Can't do it. Too shy.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you've been
holding some things back?

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
Because if so, here's your
big chance to come out

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
with all the stuff you
couldn't say before!

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
I love...

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
[gulping]

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
...your cooking. I love it.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
Not really what I
expected to walk into.

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Wow. Good thing
I told Uzaki to leave

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
the door unlocked.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.760 position:50% align:center
Hey, Saku. You okay?

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
Itsushito? What are you...?

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
Forget that. Come on.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
Get your butt over to
your futon and lay down.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Let's get you
covered up, too, Uzaki.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wanna...

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Sweet dreams, kiddos.
I'll lock up for you.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks, you guys.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
I hope you sleep well.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hold on...

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Something's kinda
weird about this.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
But what is it?

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
--Why is she in my futon?
--Why is he in my futon?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] I see.
Lemme get this straight,

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
neither of you can remember
anything about last night.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Correct.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
I get that.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
But you didn't have to come in
on your day off, you know.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Especially since I
gave you the day off on purpose!

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
Um. How about this?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
Try remembering events
in order, one by one!

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
One by one?

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
I remember cooking, for sure.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
Bringing the stuff to
make a shrimp dinner.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
And eating and drinking
while we watched movies.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that shark slammed
into that one guy.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
You know, the hero
in the third movie,

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
who then got reincarnated
in some fantasy world.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
And I was like "Whoa dude,
he's crazy strong!"

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
For some reason, that's all
I can remember, though.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
Movie sounds like a winner.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
And after that...

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
I remember enjoying Sakurai's
pitiful tipsiness for a while.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure it was
extremely amusing.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
Then, when I woke up,
we were in the same futon.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
H--!

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Would you mind
saying that again?

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
We'll listen extra
closely this time.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Talk about an obvious bribe!

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
You heard me perfectly!

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:22.792 position:50% align:center
When I woke up,
Uzaki was beside me.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Anything happen?

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Tell us...!

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
No, we didn't do anything.

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.799 position:50% align:center
I seriously can't remember
what happened last night!

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
If you don't remember,

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
then you can't be sure of
what you did, either way.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Right...?

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
These two really are a pain,

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
especially at times like this!

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
Okay, look,
I was actually there,

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
and I'm saying nothing happened.
Isn't that enough for you?!

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
Two young people and
nothing happened?!

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
That's the problem here!

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
You're mad at me?
Help me out, here, Uzaki!

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Tell them! You were up
later than I was, yeah?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Dunno. I'm trying to remember
but it's all so fuzzy.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
I can't say for sure that I was.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
I mean, I can't say anything
for certain, so...

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughing]

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
I love...

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
What are you grinning about?!

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
Uh? What grin?
I was just yawning.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
Admit it, you don't
remember anything

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
from last night, do you?

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Uh-uh.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Oh, something
definitely happened.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Something good,
I think. But even so...

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
All we can do now is imagine

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
whatever marvelous event
it might have been!

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center
I shoulda shown up even if
I had to force my way in!

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Why? Why is
my daughter like this?

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Next time, you have to
let me tag along! Promise!

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
Of course. That's fine with me.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
Yeah, let's do your place again!

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
What's the big rush?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
Oh, just shut up and buy
a guest futon, would you?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
How about you go home?

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know!
Let's do it again tonight!

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
Two nights in a row,
pretty wild!

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
[ASAI grunts]

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Are you crazy?
Classes start back up tomorrow.

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
Oh. Interesting. Uh...
So that means...

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
Our summer break is over?

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
Dead and gone.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
She's acting as if it's
the end of the world.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
For real?
You just realized this?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
Well, then, I guess I'll just
sleep until winter break.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Is hanging out the only thing
you ever think about?

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Hana! It's time to wake up, hun!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay...

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Good morning.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mom!

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
Hana's looking even
dopier than usual,

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
and it's freakin' me out.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Shut your
pie-hole, Kiri.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Here. A strong cup of coffee

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
for your first day
back at college.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
Try and perk up a bit?

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
Some college student.
Way to set an example.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
See you later!

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
[yawning]

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, g'morning, Sakurai!

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, Uzaki. Mornin'.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
So, you made it on campus.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
I was sure you'd just whine and
moan about classes again.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
I'm a slacker,
but not a total idiot.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Though, it's true.
I'm still feeling about 90%

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
of that terrible end-of-summer
shock from yesterday.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
You're not even
a little bit over it.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
I know! It's 'cause we didn't
hang out nearly enough!

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
If it were always summer,

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
then you and I could spend so
much more time together.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
You're being ridiculous.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Too harsh!

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
Sakurai!

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
You need to at least pretend
to consider a woman's feelings.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
What I meant was,

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
it doesn't have to be
summer for us to hang.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
We'll always be together.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Huh? Somethin' wrong?
What is it?

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Mm! Wait. Back up.
What I said...

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
It meant... I mean, it didn't--

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
All I was trying to say is that

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
we still have plenty of time
before we graduate!

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
Not whatever it is
that you were thinking!

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
Oh...? And whatever do you
think I was thinking, huh?

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
Tch! Damn you, girl.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
I'm a woman,
thank you very much.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
And if you want to
hang out so badly,

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll have to oblige!

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
Don't be shy, you can go
ahead and thank me now!

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me
with this smug crap?!

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
--You know what you are?!
--[UZAKI laughs]

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Annoying as hell!

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] C'mon, loner-boy!
Let's go hang out!
