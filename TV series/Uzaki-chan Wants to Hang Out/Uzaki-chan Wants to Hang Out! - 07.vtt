00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No idea!

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
And I find that analogy
really disturbing.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] All right,
guess I'll see ya later!

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
Yep. I owe you one for today,
so just think it over, okay?

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry,
I've given it lots of thought!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
What, then?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
Well, like I said earlier.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
My birthday is coming up
on August seventh!

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
I have very high hopes!

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Anyway, see ya soon!

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Her birthday?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So, that's the story.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
And she said she had
"high hopes" for her birthday.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
It's a hairy mess. Yep.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
That kind of thing doesn't
strike me as your strength.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Correct.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] She anticipated
that Sakurai would be bad

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
at this, then she threw him
for a loop with vague

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
and intimidating expectations.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
She's quite the schemer.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Yes, but that comes from
the yearning of a girl in love

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
desperate to be
noticed by her crush.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
Not that Hana realizes
it herself, of course.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
Still, any way you look at it...

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
We're gonna eat this up!

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What are you doing?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
Nothing.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
Well, have you had
any good ideas yet?

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about this pretty hard.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
Here. For you.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
Giving me flowers because
my name means "flower"?

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
So you suck at puns, too, huh?

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
Here. For you.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You bought this
before even bothering

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
to find out the right size?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
Anyway, only hotties
can get away with

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
giving this kind
of present, sorry.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
Here. This is for you.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you have given
me a uTunes card instead?

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
I want those
special-event bonuses!

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
It feels like
anything I give her

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
will end up being a disaster.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
This is getting complicated!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
In reality...

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
Sweet thing, but he
sure doesn't have

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
a good eye for flowers,
unfortunately!

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
That s'posed to be
a placeholder?

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
Hey, it has multiplayer!
I'll play with you!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
What do you have to say
about that, loner-boy?

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Sounds about right.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] I think it's
obvious she'd be happy

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
with anything
Sakurai gives her.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
I've run way too many scenarios.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm confused.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Then why not stop
and follow your intuition?

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
Do I have one of those?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Just give her the
first thing that

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
came to mind when you thought
"birthday present for Uzaki."

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
The first thing I thought was
that I didn't wanna do this.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah, I still
have no idea what to do.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
But this is it. I need
to pick something today.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
--[phone rings]
--[SAKURAI] Hm?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]
What's up, Uzaki?

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well. I, uh...

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Listen, I know
this is super sudden.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I want you to be with me!

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
I... I need you.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I want you to be with me!

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] This is weird.
What's going on with her?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]
Hey, Sakurai!

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up?

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
Sorry to spring this on you.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
It's fine, I don't mind.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
So on the phone...

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
...you said that...
you uh, wanted me?

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Um. Yeah, right, so, about that.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
I just couldn't bring
myself to go in alone!

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
Come on, you have
to come with me!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
You wanna go to a pub?

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] That's right!
Your treat, please?

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
But, what for?

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
I told you, remember?
I wanna celebrate my birthday!

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
My hopes are high!

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center
But mostly,
for... your... wallet!

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
Wait, now I understand.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
You were angling for a
pub visit this whole time.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Huh? What's happening
with your face?

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's get in there!

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI yells]

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Celebrating your
milestone twentieth

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
at a random little pub?

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! All I wanted was
to try drinking with you.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Because drinking is super-fun,
isn't that right?

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I'd say that
depends on both the drinker

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
and the circumstances.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
There are no guarantees.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
Well, if it ends up
not being fun,

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
then I know I can depend on you
to do something to make it fun!

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
Not sure I would
count on that one.

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Whatevs. Let's just enjoy.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
That sounds good. Are you ready?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
Cheers!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay. Here goes!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Go on, drink up!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
How is it?

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hm...

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Kinda like a soft drink,
but also, different.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but do you like it?

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
Does it taste good or not?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
There's this, like, painful
burning in my throat.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Deep down, inside.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Alcohol will do that.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] What's beer like?
Is it different?

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You wanna try one?

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
So sorry for the wait!
Hope you enjoy it!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
Give it a taste.

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh! You okay?

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
So, this is what beer
tastes like, huh?

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
It's bitter, but there's
more to it than that.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
You're right, which is
why it goes so great

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
with fried and salty food!

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
Let's see, then!

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's so juicy!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
Now take a slug of beer.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
See? Great, right?

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
They go perfect together!

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
It's like the beer brings out
the grease from the chicken

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
for fresh new flavor
with every bite!

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
Wow, you really chugged it.
What's the verdict?

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
Mm. I think it's great!

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
So, you should drink alcohol
with food as a rule, then?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Nah, some people
prefer to savor it on its own.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter as long as
you're enjoying yourself.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]
Well, in that case,

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
as you so kindly suggested,
I think I'm gonna do just that!

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
Good! Do it, birthday girl!

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI shouts]

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hey, just how
much are you ordering?

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
Sadly, your wallet
is already dead.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Are you kidding?
Cancel! Cancel those!

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uzaki!

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, please.
No horsing around.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
We're sorry.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs] Just calm down.
You're gonna get us--

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
The Hell?! What is this?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Oh, looks like one of
them is rated ultra-spicy.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI coughs]
Where's my beer?

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
It's gone...? And no water?

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Uzaki! A drink!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
Wait just a sec, 'kay?
I'm still looking at the menu.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I can't wait!

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
Oh, guess what?

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
I just found a drink I
bet I can make for us!

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
I should whip one up
for you sometime!

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm begging you, please, hurry!

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Thought I was a goner.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Wow, this is great!
Guess I like yuzu liqueur.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Excellent. Good for you.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Ahh...! Another round!

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Now, wait a minute!

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You're really
knocking 'em back there.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Take it easy, this is
your first time.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
Pardon me! Your yuzu.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Much obliged!

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Really? Slow down!

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
But I'm totally fine.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Uh-huh.
How many is that, anyway?

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Good question.

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center
Ah, great.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. At least sneak
some water in there.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
Crazy, right? Guess I must
be some kinda heavyweight!

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Why don't you
take a little breather?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE SERVER A]
Pardon me. Your yuzu.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Yes! Heh.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE SERVER A]
Thanks, come back again!

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
Are you feelin' okay, Sakurai?

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
You're kinda wobbly!

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, you're the only
one wobbling around here.

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well, she started strong,

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
but ended up exactly
how I expected.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
I tried to jot down how much
you drank, so you should

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
look at this and stay under
that next time, got it?

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
Wow, Sakurai, you sure got
tall all of a sudden!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's a utility pole!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
Would you please get
ahold of yourself?

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
Aw, c'mon, Sakurai. Carry me!

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Unhand me, woman!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Piggyback! Oh! Baby back ribs.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Stop! Your various
parts are all up on me!

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
Various parts? What the
heck does that mean?

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
What's touchin'
you where, loner-boy?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Geez, she's an annoying drunk!

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]
Markin' you with my scent.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I can't send her
off on her own like this.

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
Here, stand up.
I'll take you home.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Aw! I don't wanna go home!

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Let's drink some more
at your place, come on!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
No more alcohol, you dummy!

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
And would you stand up?
You're flashing me!

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
Who d'you think you're
callin' a "dummy," huh?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way,
d'you know what time it is?

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
Let's see--
Is it really that late?!

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Ha! That's too bad!
No more trains for you!

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha!

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
You little dummy-dummy-dumbutt!

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You're the dummy
who can't get home, dummy.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Let's just call a cab.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Uzaki's crazy
drinking drained me dry!

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
There's an ATM.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
Ugh, but that access fee.

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
And taxis will be charging
pricey late-night fares.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
Should I let her stay over?

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
No! Jeez! I can't think
straight when I'm boozy!

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
Quite the dilemma, huh?

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
Be serious.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't abandon your friend
far away from home, right?

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Don't tell me this was
calculated from the get-go!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't
even care anymore.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
I want water. Let's go in.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and alcohol!

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
I want'em to verify my age
'cause I'm twenty, now!

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
That's fine. Whatever.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, just so you know,
I only have a couple of covers.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
Wanna sleep together?

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No, I'm splitting it up!

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
One blanket each!

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai. Hey, Sakurai.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
Don't pass out on me yet.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, let me sleep.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
It's like three in the morning!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
Let's play a game. Please!

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] That's a hard no.
Maybe tomorrow.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
Are you really still drinking?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Yep!

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
The sooner she learns about the
horrors of alcohol, the better.

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yep. Come morning, she'll know.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. I really am fading.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll just
sleep right here.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
All right!

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.975 position:50% align:center
No stun-locking moves this time,
so let's get sparrin'!

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
Hello? Hey, you asleep?

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Just kill me now.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakurai?

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
Are you asleep for real?

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI sighs]
Well, well, well.

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
You're gonna leave me, awake,
on my own, while you drift away?

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Just ignore her. 

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
Maybe a kiss will wake him up.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI yelps]

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
See, I knew you were
faking being asleep!

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Try not to let yourself
get so worked up.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
It was just a joke!

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
I was messing with you!

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
But your reaction was pretty
frantic there, big guy.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
Is it possible you've
never been kissed before?

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
No! Shut up!
Go to sleep, you idiot!

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI yawns]

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Now, it's sleepytime.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI vomits]

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Ah...

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
My head hurts. I'm dying.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, you've got a hangover.

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Life's gonna suck for a while.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
I hate this! Why the
heck are you just fine?

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
Grown-ups drink in moderation
to avoid this exact thing.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's "modera"--

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI vomits]

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Listen, don't worry.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
Everyone has an alcohol screw-up
or three. It's normal.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
Good thing your
first time wasn't at

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
some sketchy college party.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
None of this is good.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I dunno. You did find
your limit right off the bat.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Great.
He's in lecture mode.

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
 Although, you didn't
drink much water, either.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
That's what it takes to
metabolize alcohol.

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
If you alternate with rounds
of water, you won't get sick.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
You should start feeling
better this afternoon.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
Just have to tough
it out 'til then.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI vomits]

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
You listening?

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
[vomitting continues]

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
Wow, she really is in hell.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The bigger the
screw-up, the better the lesson.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Next time, drink as much
water as you do booze.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine, because I'm
never drinking again

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
as long as I live. Ugh...

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Probably for the best.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
Although, everyone with a
hangover tends to say that.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
No, this is... hell.
Never ever, ever again.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well, I'm gonna
go hit the store.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
You hold down the fort.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
Rest up, okay?
