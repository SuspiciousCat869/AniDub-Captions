it's already summer.

Sakurai!

[giggles]

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.700 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Well. Guess it's that
sweaty time of year again, huh?

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
Maybe you wouldn't sweat
if you weren't so hyper.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
Hey, I had an idea.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's that?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
It's just. I was wondering if I
could come over to your place?

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
What? Again?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah!

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
I can see you're not
grasping how committed I am

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
to Uzaki Hills

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
and the deep fear I have of
you building more without me!

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I so won't.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
Creepy old tower.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
Thing looks like an evil
emperor's hangout.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?
What're you talking about?

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
Stuffed to the brim
with only the best!

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
That's my dream house!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
So you're telling me
you'd set up a lava moat

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center
in your own house?

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, that.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
That's so I'm prepared if you
decide to drop by and visit.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.738 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Now you want to trap me?

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Trap you? Ha! Get over yourself!

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I meant with the lava!

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
Rgh. I hate it when you do that!

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Crazy  cat.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
What the heck are
you doing up here?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
I'm coming to get you.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
Just stay right there
and be a good kitty.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Almost got you.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
See? You're okay.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.201 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Crap!

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI shouts]
No!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
[shouting continues]

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Whoa. Was I dreaming?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Well, duh, I guess.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
I must've nodded off,
then woke back up in a panic.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
That hasn't happened in a while.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
Man, I really hope
no one else saw.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
[grunts[
Seriously? Why is it always her?

00:03:56.277 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Stop! Turn around!
We're in the middle of class!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Aw... Good morning,
Mr. Sleepyhead!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
Lemme guess, were you
falling in your dream

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.538 position:50% align:center
and then you suddenly woke up?

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.581 position:50% align:center
Cuz you totally jolted awake!

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Try not to nod off, grandpa!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy I got to
witness this moment.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
God, you are so annoying!

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
Look, just shut it!
Class has started, okay?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oops, my bad!

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
How many of you are
familiar with the idea

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
of dream interpretation?

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
It holds that the content
of one's dreams

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
reveals one's mental state.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
Dreams of falling from a
great height, for example,

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
can indicate deep-seated,

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
conscious or subconscious
feelings of anxiety.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Aw, is somebody anxious?

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I hope you know
you can tell me anything.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Safe space.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up?

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE LECTURER A] It's also
common to dream of falling

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
when one is in very high spirits
and maybe getting carried away.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
This can be interpreted as a
warning to put one's feet...

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, were you getting
carried away?

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
Seriously, shut up.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't get
too excited, okay?

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
Gotta keep those feet on
the ground, my brosky.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.260 position:50% align:center
Look who's talking!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, the timing of
that lecture was amazing!

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
It was so hilarious!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect to have
your deepest psyche

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
laid bare in class, didja?

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Whatever, I'm not a kid.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
I don't believe in
that stuff, anyway.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE LECTURER A]
Maybe it was juvenile.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Well, I'm more
of a believer, I guess.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
Psychological tests,
blood-type fortunes.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Pure superstition, all of it.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
That's not what actual
psychology is about.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
Sure. That's easy to say, but I
bet you believe it a little bit.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Nope, sorry.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
Come on,
psychologically speaking--

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
Not good.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Watch out!
What are you trying to do?

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
Nice catch there, buddy.
Oh, that was scary!

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] That's what happens
when you're more focused

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
on riling someone up
than watching your step.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
Mind your business!

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
Huh. Just had a thought.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
About what?

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
People who climb down stairs

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
can develop climacophobia,
the fear of climbing.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
Wow, where the heck did that
come from all of a sudden?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's like an aftershock.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh yeah?

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's commonly
known as "the stair yips".

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
You'll just be navigating stairs
as usual when, one day,

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
you realize you can't seem get
down them smoothly anymore.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Or you tumble, until, at last,

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
you find that you're terrified
of the very stairs themselves.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hear this!

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI yells]

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C]
Aw!

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
C'mon, why not?

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
'Cause I have plans
with that guy.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS growl]

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
Maybe next time, 'kay?

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Aw!

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
Man. Good timing there, dude.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
They were relentless!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50% align:center
Wait, what gives?
You running away?

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
I've never had much fun

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
going out drinking
with that bunch.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
We just don't click.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] So many people
drink way too much.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
I prefer to be a bit
more chill. Heh.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
So sober me is usually stuck
cleaning up the mess.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah. I'm not into that, either.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
Sakaki's getting away.
Aren't we following him?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
[GIRL D] Hmm. I don't know,
that other guy's scary.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
I get that. It's the eyes.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
[GIRL D]
Yeah, right?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
Those two are together
a lot, though.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
Must be friends.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So, what's up?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
Kinda feels like I barely saw
you around at all last month.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Yeah. I popped
over to Okinawa.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
What? But we weren't on break!

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Meh. I had a sudden
urge to see the ocean.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
Wow, must be nice.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
What about you, Saku?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Anything happen
while I was gone?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Nope.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Ah. I mean...

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
No. Nothing.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
What even was that?

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
This last month is kind
of impossible for me

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
to put into words.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
What happened?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
Life! I mean, it was
basically normal.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
I went to class, went to work,

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
did a lot of gaming
and stuff like that.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
I kept pretty busy, I guess.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Stop! Can't you just let go

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
and get a little wild
for once in your life?

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
I've been hanging out
with you for three years

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
and your life is so boring
I can hardly take it!

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
You're a bummer, dude.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
You know we only get
four years of college

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
and you're totally
wasting them.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
Find a girl, man!

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
There it is. Why do
you always say that?

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI grunts]
There's no time for drinking!

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] What the heck?
Dude, you just gave it to me!

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
Idiots like you who waste
their youth are infuriating!

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
--[UZAKI] Hey, Sakurai!
--[SAKAKI] Huh?

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
There you are! I was
trying to find you--

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
Who's this?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
Might this person be...?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
No way. Is it possible
he's your friend?

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] So, wait. You're saying.
You really do have a friend?

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know you
talked him up and all.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Gotta be honest, though,

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
I definitely thought
he was imaginary.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
What're you saying, moron?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
You totally saw me eating
with him in the dining hall!

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
Yes, I remember that.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
I thought you were just
pretending he was your friend.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
This knowledge makes me happy!

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.861 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Wait, you were
seriously worried about me?

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Would you quit with that look?

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, you're the same
girl I've seen with Saku

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
now and then, aren't you?

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Hi there, the name's Sakaki.
I'm a junior, too.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hana Uzaki, sophomore!

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
Sakurai is a hardcore gloomlord,

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
but I hope you guys have
fun together, anyway.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Will you please get outta here?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
Listen I don't want
you to worry.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
I'll promise I'll still keep
hanging out with you.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
So? Where are we gonna
go after class today?

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Why are you saying
that as if my schedule's

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
already booked?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Huh? Cuz I said I wanted
to hang out at your place!

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You want to come over again?

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
If you're always hanging out
with your one male friend,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
people are definitely
gonna talk.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
I mean, you guys'll be
fan art before you know it.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Who exactly are
you worried about, anyway?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
Who cares what
other people think?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
Also, your random assumption
that I only have one male friend

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
is pretty freakin' stupid.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't feel like
you have to show off, now.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
What? I'm not!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
So that's how it is...

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
[school bell rings]

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. That's my cue!
Off to class! See ya!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No you won't.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
She's nice.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
I guess, kinda.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Oh, Saku, you dog.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
It's not like that.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Hey, don't worry. I get you.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb with me.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
Little Sakurai's finally
found some love at last!

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
Would you stop?
You don't get it at all!

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
Don't be bashful.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
I'm your wingman for life.
I've got your back!

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's great!
Another giant pain in my ass!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] What sorta thing are
you after? Romantic? Erotic?

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
Oh, this summer is
gonna be so lit!

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Yes, I rock!

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
Ah, dammit.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
Hey! 'Sup, guys?

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
Very little.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] So, how long have
you two known each other?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
She went to my high school.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
We were both in the same club.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Huh. A pretty long time, then.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
You could say that.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
So, you've spent a lot
of time together.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
You fool around?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
Okay, listen.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
This guy looks good, but he's
actually the worst, isn't he?

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
That a no?

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
'Course it is!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
It's not something
you talk about,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
and we wouldn't
tell you if we did!

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Not even a little?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
No, never!

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
--[SAKAKI] Not at all?
--Not at all!

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh, never mind.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wait, what? Did we--

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
Hang on a sec, I seriously
don't remember anything!

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Nah, it's fine.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's just between us,
so if you don't know,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
I guess it doesn't count.
It's okay.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No, this is not okay! Tell me!

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
Yep, I called it!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Shut up!
This is a form of harassment!

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Now you're mad
and I don't even know why!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
Him, too! This is
sexual harassment!

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
Just drop it.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Sorry.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Sexual harassment?

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Not that I'm worried.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
I mean, Sakurai's probably the
safest creature in the world.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Okay, when you put it like that,

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
it sounds like an insult.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Again, sorry.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
The thing is in all these
years I've never heard any

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
romantic tales
about Saku before.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
Seeing Mr. Serious here
with a real, live girl

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
piqued my interest.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
Perfectly understandable.

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
But the truth is, he's simply
a gloomy klutz of a sleepyhead

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
villain loner, so I just
try to keep him company.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
Who's a gloomy klutz of a
sleepyhead villain loner?

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
I like to spend my time quietly,
by myself, that's all.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
You bounce off each other well!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
And it's not just me.
I bet everyone thinks so!

00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
You know how people are:
"Oh, those two must be dating".

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Haven't you heard
that a ton by now?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But in this case, we're not.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Okay. You're not, yet.
I accept that.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
But y'know, you're gonna
have to eventually.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
Uzaki. Come on, let's go grab
some ice cream. My treat.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Really? Woo-hoo!

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Did they just run away?

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
This wasn't the
reaction I expected.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
I pictured something
a little less complicated.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
But it's not that he
simply dislikes her.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
What is it, then? Hmm?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Got a sec?

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
And who are you?

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Ami Asai. I'm a senior
and a friend of those two.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
I'm Sakaki and in his class.
What's up?

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Sakaki. What the heck was that?

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya mean? We were only
having a friendly convo.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Why, were you listening in?

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
You totally should
have joined us!

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
You took it way too far.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Teasing those two is
one thing, but come on,

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
did you have to be so
blatantly obvious about it?

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
I thought I was just
putting out some feelers.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
I got shut down, though.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Well, I'm looking
after those two,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
and I won't let anyone
shove them off course.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
Doing things your way could end
up nipping their love in the bud

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
before it gets started.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
You have to watch it
from a distance,

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
with no unnecessary prying!

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
I get it.

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
So, it sounds to me like you're
rooting for them, too, huh?

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
And you really do seem to care.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:31.538 position:50% align:center
I respect that.
And you've convinced me.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
It's good to know we both
want them together.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] That being the case,
how 'bout we team up?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Seriously, at this point,
I'd do anything for those two!

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
What?!

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Have I given you the
impression that I need

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
anyone's help?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Quit meddling, you got that?

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
And what part of me wanting to
just observe them on my own

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
do you not understand?
It's not quite rocket science!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Uh, you sound
pretty unhinged, lady!

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] I will not let you
meddle indiscriminately

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
in their very delicate business!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Geez, you're a pain!

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'd say you both are.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't you wanna share
this with me? Here ya go!

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Aw. You sure
you don't want a bite?

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
C'mon, no need to be shy.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
I mean, after all,
you bought them.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
Take one.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hm? That color package
could only be one thing.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
Chocolate mint, right?

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Is that really any good?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, choco-mint
is delicious!

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
I've just always
heard it's, like--

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
I mean, the flavor,
isn't it just toothpaste?

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
What did you just say to me?

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I want you to
look me right in the eye

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
and tell me that again.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wait, what?

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
I--

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I was just wondering
if choco-mint was good,

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
cuz it sounds like
toothpaste to me.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
There it is!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
You suck!

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
That is always what people
say when they're mocking

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
choco-mint-lovers!

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
But I'm not mocking anything.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, yes you certainly are!

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
And it started when you
compared it to toothpaste!

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
Because, for some reason,
even though it's your

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
garbage palate's fault
you can't eat choco-mint,

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
you cowards are always
so quick to slam the mint!

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
"Oh, weird! Isn't that
just toothpaste?"

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
Then, inevitably, these
stupid jerks always go,

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
"No way that can be good,"

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.401 position:50% align:center
and, "Why don't you just
eat toothpaste, then?"

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
Morons! Toothpaste isn't
something you eat!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
Can you even
imagine it, Sakurai?

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
How infuriating it is to
be mocked by idiots

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
who don't know the difference
between toothpaste and food?

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh, no!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] But y'know what
I really can't stand?

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
The sheer arrogance of
those people who think it's

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
actually okay to persecute
whatever they don't understand!

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
We choco-mintians have been
abused for far too long!

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
"Choco-mintians"?

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
We've suffered abuse that stems

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
from a lack of understanding!

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
When choco-mint, as ice cream,
first made its way to Japan

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
from distant continents, sales
were initially poor due to its

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
intense, disturbing color
and fresh, unique flavor.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
And yet!

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
We choco-mintians,
amidst much bias and prejudice,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
slowly grew in number thanks
to many years of effort.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
Now the flavor's praised
as invigorating.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
Even social-media-worthy!

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] With more cafés serving
delicious choco-mint sweets

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
and more varieties
of choco-mint yumminess

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
on grocery store shelves
with every passing year!

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
Even so!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
The palate-poor anti-choco-mint
brigade still chooses ignorance!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
Rise, O' choco-mintians!

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
Turn your sadness into
anger and take your stand!

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
You hate it! Admit it!

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
Think about this: it sucks when
people mock your favorite game

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
when they've never played
and know nothing about it,

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
isn't that true?

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well, yeah, it does.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Besides, you've got
the whole thing backwards!

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
I want you to listen carefully:

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
mint does not taste
like toothpaste,

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
toothpaste tastes
like mint, idiot!

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wow. She is seriously pissed.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
Never mind those
losers with no taste!

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
I will love choco-mint
until I die!

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much,
yummy choco-mint!

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
With the very first bite...

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
The sharp, refreshing mint
flavor fills every part

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
of your mouth.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
The gentle notes of sweet
chocolate slowly fading

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
into the distance.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
And that bright yet
somehow soothing feeling

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
makes you want to take
another bite, immediately.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
No matter what anyone says...

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
...choco-mint... is life.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What the hell?

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI sighs]
Thank you very much.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
Brava. Glad you were able to
get that off your chest.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I think everyone's
free to hate what they want.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
But don't diss what someone
else likes, you know?

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
Mind your own beeswax!

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Though you did mock my
solo movies, remember?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
To be fair, that was just
because I never dreamed

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
that you could possibly be
one of those lower lifeforms.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Over one lousy ice cream?

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
This is a little much.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
Well. It's not that I hate it.

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
I could just never
handle mint as a kid.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
So, anything with that
cooling sensation...

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
Gum, cough drops... forget it.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
To this day I even use
non-mint toothpaste.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
But the cooling sensation's
the best part!

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
With the sweet chocolate chaser?
I mean, are you kidding me?

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
That's the whole thing
about choco-mint!

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Anyway, since I
can't seem to do mint.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, I haven't
tried choco-mint.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Uh... Wha--

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI yells]

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
You're one of them!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Those who dare to mock
choco-mint untasted

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
like utter fools! You turd!

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] All right!
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
I get it. It all stems
from childhood trauma.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
But you should be
good to go, now.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like you're
a child anymore, so...

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] They do say your
sense of taste changes

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
as you grow up.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Maybe, I dunno.

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
You wanna try one, just to see?

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh... Rgh...

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Why the hesitation?

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine, I promise it's
not too intense or anything.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
What? Are you really scared?

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
C'mon, you can do it!

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Conquer your bias.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
Mint's not scary.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No, but your eyes sure are!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Look, just eat it already.

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
All right, fine. Here goes.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
Great! See? Now just say, "ah!"

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Now that I think
about it, isn't this...

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
...an indirect kiss?

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
Now her silliness is
rubbing off on me!

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But if I don't eat this now,

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
it'll turn into a
whole thing again.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
Couldn't she be a little more
mindful of this crap?

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
Verdict?

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]
It's actually... tasty, I'd say.

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
That's kind of a vague answer.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
But at least you did
manage to try it!

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
Last one's mine!

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:45.347 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Uh. What for?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grunts]
Nothing. Forget it.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Now? You realize it now?

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
