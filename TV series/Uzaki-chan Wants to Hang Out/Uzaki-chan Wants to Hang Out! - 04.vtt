Oh, Sakurai, before I forget, 

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
we'll be taking a family trip to
a hot spring over Golden Week.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
So, you'll have time off.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
Hey, why not take advantage
of the long holiday

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
and maybe go on a
little vacation yourself?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh. Hm...

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It wasn't a bad suggestion,

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
but yeah, playing video games
for 72 hours straight

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
is more my style.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
No way. Am I at
the final boss?

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

--[doorbell ringing]

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
Does she think I didn't
hear it the first time?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
[ringing, knocking continues]

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
There you are! What's up?

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
Yep. Her.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Are you free today?
I mean, you totally are, right?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
All this popping over
unannounced is a bit much.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Would you stop?

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
I knew you were off work, so I
figured a loner like you would 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
be home gaming rather than
taking a vacay, and look!

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.335 position:50% align:center
I was right!

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
Awesome. Good for you.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
So, anyways, I decided
to take pity on you

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
and come by to hang out so you
won't be alone on a holiday!

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
Stop being condescending,
it's pissing me off.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Anyway...

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
Look! Doramon Go!
You wanna play with me?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's still a video game!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
There's this big spawning event

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
during Golden Week.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
We could catch 'em all,
together!

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I do have the app.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
Yeah...? And...? But...?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
But I was too embarrassed
to play by myself, okay?

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
Called it! He, he.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
Man, I can read you just
like a freakin' book!

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
Why'd you turn it off?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
I thought we were
gonna play together.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmph.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] This'll take all day.
Then again, why not?

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Please, come on!

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] What the hell,
I'm bored. Count me in.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
Excellent!

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
[game rings]

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I found a Lousy Cat!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
Hey, check this out! A cat!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Oh, wow.
You look like crap.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]
Too much gaming.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's one thing
to be all scowly, 

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
but walking around in
public with that face?

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
You'll get reported.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Stop being so dramatic!

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
Why did I do this?

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hey, you sure
seem to be catching a lot!

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
And all Gorillas.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, they just keep popping up.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Ugh, my eyes.
Hurts to look at the screen.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh! Maybe we should go
buy you some glasses, then!

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
Hello, welcome.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
Is that... Ami?

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps] Oh, my gosh!
Fancy running into you two!

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Your eyes hurt
from gaming. Makes sense.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
I bet he's gonna go
crazy if this keeps up.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
You're the crazy one here!

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Does this mean... that the
whole time we were gone,

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
the only thing you did was game?

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
'Fraid so.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
And he'd probably still be
holed up with a controller

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
if I hadn't come along!

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]
I can't deny it.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
Since she's already
here and all,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
why don't you ask Ami
to be your glassistant?

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
My glassistant?

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Sure thing.
Do you know what you want?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Yeah, the loner
indoorsman game-addict here

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
needs those things:
Computer glasses!

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
They're the ones that cut
down on the blue light

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
that displays put off.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
Yeah, these are supposed
to keep your eyes

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
from getting too tired.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
I've actually always
wanted a pair, myself!

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, that does sound
good for long gaming sessions.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
These lenses have kind of
a yellow-ish tint to 'em.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
So, they're like
low-key sunglasses, huh?

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, ASAI gasp]

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You look really
good in specs, Sakurai!

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Yeah. You do!

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
I think you should try
on these on next!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Oh, nice!
Okay, should we try some others?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Totally!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Ooh, which ones?

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
How about these?

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Like I'm some kinda doll.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Those are perfect for you!

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
Why do you say that?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
'Cause they hide
your big, scary,

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
glare-mug so you look
more like a normal person!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
Would you stop it with
the glare-mug? Not cool!

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
you should probably wear these
at work and school, too!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, shut up.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
Hey, what do you
think about these?

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, ASAI laugh]

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
Where did you find those?
They're hilarious!

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
Now Ami's messing
with me, too. That's great.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. So good. Mind if
I take a little picture?

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I definitely do!

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Say cheese!

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
Actually, don't bother.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center
I can't hold the phone
still enough for a shot

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
because I'm laughing
way too hard!

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
Just knock it off! Damn.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Wait, hold on a sec.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
I need you to try these
on next for me next, okay?

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You're already
laughing about them!

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, ASAI laugh]

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, the combo
of these glasses

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
and your resting-scare-face
makes you look like a mafioso!

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
Like you'd assassinate someone
with a long piece of wire!

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
Sakurai: dominator of
the criminal underworld!

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]]
Oh! Even better,

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
throw on a white coat and you
could be a mad scientist!

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
Ha! Whaddaya think?

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
No way! Where were these?
I'm putting them back!

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hold on!

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
You gotta do something first,
pretty please!

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Please brush your hair
straight back with those

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
little round glasses
on just once for me?

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Only one time, I swear!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
Such an embarrassingly
tropey character!

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
I just have to see that! Ha, ha!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I don't exist for
your amusement, you know!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Sorry, sorry!
Here, try on this last pair.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
These are a serious suggestion.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
'Kay?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, fine.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Alright, now, make a fist.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
And raise your arm.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
Open your mouth a little.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.799 position:50% align:center
Ay-oh!

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, ASAI laugh]

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! That was so funny
I can barely stand it!

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hana why don't you
pick out your own glasses

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
while we're here?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
Great idea!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
--[UZAKI giggles]
--[ASAI] What'll it be?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Jeez, which ones?

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
These are pretty nice!

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do like a pink frame,
but I don't know, let's see.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling these red ones!

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Ooh, yeah!

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, come over here

Seriously?!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
Hey, I was complimenting
you earlier!

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
Did you forget about that?

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
Right, then you called
me a mafioso, 

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
so I'd say that kinda
makes it a wash!

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Way to nit-pick!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
That's what you are, you know!
You're a mean nit-picker!

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
 You're the one who needs to
watch what she says and does!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
You got that?

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
Well, you're the one
who's always angry

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
for basically no reason!

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
You're such a moron!
You ask for it!

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
Only a moron calls
someone a moron, moron!

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You just said
it yourself, moron!

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
How dumb are you?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Well, but you said
it first, moron! Moron! Moron!

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
You think...
they're gonna be all right?

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Mm-hm. Yep.
They're always like that.

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Man, I missed
out on getting glasses, 

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
and it's all your fault,
Mr. Grouch.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
Oh! Got a Lousy Cat Dandy!

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault, you just
had to start something.

Don't you dare try to
dump all the blame on me

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
just because you're older.
That's an abuse of power.

Hey, I got a Lousy Cat
Genius this time!

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
No. Clearly, it's your fault,
because you're the one

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
who started it to begin with,
you little brat.

[UZAKI yelps]

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center

Good! With this game, the more
people there are around you,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center

Very funny. No, I don't.

They seem to like me.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center

Oh, right. I think there might
be a soccer match today

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
at a stadium nearby.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center

I can do this.

Thanks for blocking
me from that big guy.

This is our stop!

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Come back! Come back!

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well, now what?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
Where the heck am I?
Wait, what time is it even?

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
Oh. Looks like I've missed about
a million calls from Uzaki.

[phone beeps]

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
Uh! And, one of these.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
So, that's how your
Golden Week went.

Interesting.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center

[CAFÉ OWNER]
Okay. No laughing.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
And? Anything else?

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
And nothing.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
I blacked out before
it got to that point.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
What?

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
If she was gonna make
me feel that way,

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
I figured I'd just be
better off unconscious!

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
I see.

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Hm! Quite a feat
to be able to turn his mind

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
on and off at will.
Poor, pitiful kid.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't think you
should worry too much

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
about what happened between you.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
After all, you're so young.
Enjoy life while you can.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
I mean,

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
I'm sure my Ami is hanging out
with boys now and again, right?

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
Where'd that come from?

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
See? What did I just say?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You're not?

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Why are you apologizing?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Wow. Who woulda thought
something so hilarious--

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
I mean, terrible happened
to you guys!

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
You just said
it was "hilarious"!

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
An unfortunate choice of words.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
I really think you should
follow up with Hana.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
I mean, she invited you.
It's only polite, after all.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm. Guess you're right.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I don't know what's up,
but I will not engage.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
Too much trouble.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
Stop with the inner struggle
and come talk to me, Sakurai.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center

She's engaging me.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Did something happen?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
I looked at the calendar
and it hit me.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
It's bad. No holidays in June.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's why you're so down?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal about that?
You've still got weekends off.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well, sure, I guess,

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
but the longer breaks are so
much better, don't you think?

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Just get over it.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
I can't help it.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
A three-day break really
winds you up, you know?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
Besides. I get so
depressed thinking about

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
this crappy weather sticking
around for whole 'nother month.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
That's fair.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
But after the rainy season
comes the summer break.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
But not before exams.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
[groans]
I wanna go have fun! Boo.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Let's do it, then.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
What do you say we do
something next weekend?

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
You mean it?!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
Don't startle me like that!

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
You startled me!

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
This same old loner of a dude,
suggesting we go somewhere?

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
Has hell frozen over?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
It must be a
freaking glacier now!

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
Could you be any more confusing?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
It's probably raining cuz you
screwed up the weather! Ugh!

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
Look, you gotta calm down,

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
because I can't make heads
or tails of this conversation!

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
If the weekend doesn't work
for you, then never mind.

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
I'll go!

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Okay, good.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
Well, you have
any place in mind?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
Yea, I know! How about
another outing by train?

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Sounds fun.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
What's up? Your face is red.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
Nothing. But no trains, though.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
Then do you mind if I just
throw something together?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No, please do.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Yay! This is gonna be awesome!

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That is one frightening laugh.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] It's not every day that
you invite me out, you know.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, well.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I felt pretty
bad about what happened

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
over Golden Week, so...

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
Aw, is that true?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah. And I
was telling Ami about it

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
and she said I should
follow up with you.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
Ugh...

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
What? You look angry.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
I'm not angry.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh, yeah, you totally are.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Nope, not in the slightest.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, come on.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
Look, if I were mad, you would
definitely know it, 'kay?

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Eh? What the hell is going on?

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hmph.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
And it's pouring.
Forget going out.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
I hope she hasn't left yet.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Oh, hey, I
was just about to call you.

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
I figured if it was gonna
rain the whole day,

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
I may as well play
games at your place.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd cook,
so I did a little shopping,

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
but then it started
coming down even harder.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
By the time I left the store,
it was a disaster.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I appreciate it,
but don't go overboard.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Can I borrow your shower?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
Oh, and a change of clothes.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
Man, I guess I
shouldn't have worn

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
my favorite shirt today, huh?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
Oh! Any chance you'd
care to join me?

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]
Would you just go?

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles]

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
This is nuts!

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
I'm soaked clear
through to my undies!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
Hey! TMI!

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.980 position:50% align:center
It's ginormous! Mm-hm.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll go get lunch started
before we start playing.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that sounds
like a good plan.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Ta-da!

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
I know you don't have
any good cookware here,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
so I've decided I'm gonna
give you my old pot!

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
Is that cool?

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Wow, yeah, that's incredibly
nice of you. Thanks a lot.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]
So, first...

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Need help?

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
Well, I know you're not a cook.
How 'bout washing the veggies?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
What's up? You're so
obedient right now.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It just seems like
everything's been going

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
wrong for you today,
so, I thought, you know...

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
Ha! It's fine. And
I'm a good cook.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
You said you couldn't
taste the yummy grub

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
I made for you
when you were sick,

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
so, if I'm being
perfectly honest,

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
there might be a little
score-settling in the mix.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah, I'm really
sorry I said that now.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Well, my cooking will have your

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
unsophisticated palate
moaning in ecstasy!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
And, once again,

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
you've jumped
right over the line.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Which game to start with?

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hm. Oh, look,
you've downloaded Meowcraft!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
That's perfect!
Why don't we play that?

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] C'mon, let's work
together to build something

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
totally out-there!

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
What a great way for
a college student

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
to completely waste a day off.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Ah, whatever.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
You ready to be a
useless human?

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
You've been one all along,
so you've taught me well.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
Back off, you!

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Ha! That was fun!

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
I guess it was
expecting too much

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
to finish our build
in one day.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
It did get torn
down a few times.

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
But, we'll work on it the
next time you're over.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Next time? Really?

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
Huh? That sounds perfect!

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
Enough with that
scary laugh, you weirdo!

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about
the pot of curry.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
Put it the fridge
just like it is, okay?

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I will.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
It'll taste even better.

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
After sitting overnight, I mean.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
You know, I've heard that.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
Is it true?

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
Yes! You have to let it
sit overnight so the roux

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
will soak into the
meat and veggies,

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
which then releases
their umami components:

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
amino acids, sugars,
into the roux!

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
That's how you get a
richer umami flavor

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
all throughout the curry.
It's a total must.

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm sorry I asked.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
Good, I'm glad!

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
Even though today's batch
was already plenty good.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
Sakurai?

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
You said we could keep working
on the build "next time,"

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
so how 'bout if we
do that tomorrow?

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
Oh, you wanna pick up where
we left off today? Sure.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
I mean, God knows I'm free.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
Well, then. Bye!

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll see ya in a bit!

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Wait, what? Where is it?

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
I seem to have left my train
pass back at your place.

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
You are something else.
