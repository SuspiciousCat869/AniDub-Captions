00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Slow jazz
played at a moderate volume.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
Warm, indirect lighting.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
And, of course, the soothing
aroma of coffee.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
Ever since I opened this café,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
I've tried to create
the perfect ambiance.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
My goal is to provide a space
where customers feel at ease.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
Ah, Sakurai. That man's
about to come check out.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
Mind seeing to his bill?

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
Whoa, nuts. How did you know
he was gonna close out?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Mm...
When you've been running a place

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
for a decade, you just know.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Sakurai started
working at the café last year.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
He's pretty good.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
Sure, he looks like a
tough guy, but he's attentive.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
And understands how
I run the place.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:12.280 position:50% align:center
No matter what problems arise,
he handles himself with poise.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center
I've never seen him
make a fuss, or--

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No!

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.826 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Hm?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]
Sakurai!

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] That's the first
time I've heard Sakurai shout.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
And at such a volume.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.585 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Wowzers!
So this is where you work!

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.798 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you tell me it was
so close to school! Nice!

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
A close friend, perhaps?

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
I spotted you working
through the window!

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
I was on my way back from
visiting my friend who happens

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
to live around the corner!

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I was
hungry so I figured

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.392 position:50% align:center
I'd go for a quick snack--

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.643 position:50% align:center
Get out!

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.104 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Why should I?

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.398 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Or maybe an enemy.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] This may be
where I work part-time,

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
but it's also a place to relax.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
So... beat it!

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
What's your problem?

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
I just wanna chill out
here for a little bit.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm starving.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Find food somewhere else.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
Why're you so mean?

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Lemme eat.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
I just wanna be a
paying customer.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Not a chance.
You'll ruin the mood.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What?!

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
This is gross discrimination.
No wonder you got no friends.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
I've got all I need.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Well, it would
be awkward if I stood up now.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hi! Are you his boss?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
The name's Hana Uzaki!

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
I hope this fool doesn't
screw up too much.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to get me fired?

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
What's up down there, huh?

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Oh, not much.
I'm checking our stock.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
So... Sakurai's obviously
older than you.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Are you in elem--middle school?

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
I'm a college student!

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
And, fortunately, she's a
year behind me.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
You were totally gonna say
"elementary school" at first,

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
--weren't you?
--[SAKURAI laughs]

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
Shorties like you must
get that all the time.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Shut up! New subject!

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
Wait. Is this true?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
I think he just went into shock.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hm. He's usually so
good at assessing people.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] After all my years
in the café business,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd developed
an astute eye.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
What is this madness?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER gasps]

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Ah--

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
Now I see. You're an adult.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
Huh? Like I said. College.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] My impression of the
owner has drastically changed

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
in the last few seconds.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I guess this spot
is as good as any other.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Go on, sit down.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
Now, order.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
The service is great.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
Why do I get the feeling you're
not giving me 100 percent?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
Just order.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
I am a legit customer, now.
Cus-to-mer.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
I find it hard to believe this
is how you always act at work.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
Unless you're
completely hopeless

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
when it comes to your job.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm a top-notch waiter.
Except when it comes to morons.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me! Sir!

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
This employee is insulting me!

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
You outta give him
a pay cut. For real.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
Shut your face! If you're not
going to order, then get out!

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER laughs]

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
These two are a delight!

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Such prime people watching.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
Some advice.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
You need to take work seriously
no matter who you're serving,

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
understand me?
It's called professionalism.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
Yeah, because if I did
take this seriously,

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
you'd never stop
making fun of me.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
No, I would never.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] To be honest,
it's sort of embarrassing

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
when people I know see me
playing the nice waiter.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
But this is so close to campus,

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
that people you know must
drop by on the regular.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
Do you give them the same
attitude that you're giving me?

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
No, silly. This is just for you.
Because you're special.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
At least, to me you are.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
Now order a drink and get
the hell out of my café,

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
you damn idiot.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Badmouthing me
while posed like that

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
really sends mixed messages!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
Don't be rude, Sakurai.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
Why not show the girl
what you can do?

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
He's always so great
with the customers.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
Here we go! Ha! Okay!

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
I'll take one
nice waiter, please.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
Start over,
beginning with the water.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
You are infuriating.
You know that?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
May I please take your order?

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Nope! Nuh-uh! It's too good!

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
I thought your
resting-thug-face was bad.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
But this? That voice?
So dumb I can't take it!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
So not fair, Sakurai!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
It's human nature to laugh when
you know you're not supposed to!

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
I knew this is what
would end up happening

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
from the beginning!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!
I can't control myself!

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
I'm so hungry!

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
In your dreams!

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
You can call it a day, Sakurai.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
I'll finish up here.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
It's getting late.
Walk her home.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You're laughing
at me, too, aren't you?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
I can see you shaking! Ah!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
See you next time.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
My stomach's gonna eat itself.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Let's stop n' get some food.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I'm sure you
have stuff at home.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
Lame!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
Then at least let me order
something at the café next time.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
You can drop by again
whenever I'm not working.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
What? I pinky promise
I won't laugh again!

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
Not even at that
stupid smile. Heh.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
Liar!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
Heh. For real, though,
that's a neat café.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Quiet and not too stylish.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm. Yup I agree. I do like it.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
Laid-back vibe.
And a quiet atmosphere.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, I know!

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
I should ask for a
part-time job there!

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Then we could be coworkers!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, wouldn't that be the best?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm-hm.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'd murder you.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's your problem?!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Why do I always start new games

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night?

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI hums]

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
It's a perfect day
to tease Sakurai,

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
which is exactly
what my heart needs.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Ow! Hey, easy, come on!

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
I just wanna--

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
You're so cute.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
Ah! Dang, those claws are sharp.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Stop. Calm down.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
Hey, please?

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
Pathetic.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Why are you so alive
this early in the morning?

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
It's weird.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. It's you.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
I found this stray
cat in the road.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
It's not running away,
so I thought I could pet it.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, it must be used to people.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Thing won't let me
give it any lovins, though.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
It keeps scratching me.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
Then why do you have that
goofy look on your face?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Just look how cute it is!

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
Well, I can see you're trying.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
But it's obvious you're
a total beginner

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
when it comes to animals.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
Uh. Kinda.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Bring your hand from underneath.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
Cats are terrified
of bigger beasties.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
So reaching down from overhead's
a surefire way to spook them.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
That makes sense. I guess.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
Stay low to the ground
and let them come to you.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
Aww. Who's a good kitty?

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
See? It couldn't be simpler
when they're used to people.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] It might belong to
a family in the neighborhood,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
or someone could
put food out for it.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
Are you some kinda
cat whisperer?

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
I'd hope so, we have
some at home.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
Two furballs.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Really?

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
Do you want to drop by
and say hello?

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'd like to pet those cats,

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
but a guy going to a girl's
house alone raises eyebrows.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
[brakes squeal]

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
So long, new friend.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
I bet the sound of
the brakes scared it.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
Cats hate high-pitched
noises like that.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
But if it lives around here,
you'll see the kitty again,

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
no doubt about it.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
All right. Let's get to class!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
Is it so much to ask
that I get to pet a cat?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
You're really bummed.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Nah. I'm fine.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
I love animals, but my
parents can't have them.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
They're not allowed
at my place, either.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Truth be told,

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
I've never had the chance
to touch many kit-cats.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI groans]

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
That's easy to fix.
I'll go catch that one!

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
It's definitely around
here somewhere.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
An animal that tame won't travel
too far from home base.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
No! I'm good, really.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
If I fail, we'll visit
a cat café someday!

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on!

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
Huh? Found ya! He, he...

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] And leap!
You're mine, little kitty!

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
Huh...?! Oh!

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
Are you okay!

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Bad news! Quick! I need help!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
Something happen to the cat?

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What the...?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What are you--?!

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of stuck
in some shrubbery.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Put that ass... away!

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's the big idea?

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
Oh crap. Sorry. My bad.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Did you just spank me?
What's wrong with you?

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
I could see your panties,
so I tried to help you out.

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Alrighty then,
well, in that case.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
He saw my undies?

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
Wait, bigger news,
he touched my butt!

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
I'll interrogate him later.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Look, could you
please lend a girl a hand.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Grab my hips and
get me out of here.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, of course.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Can't believe this girl.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Bad idea! Stop!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Why?

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
New problem. My clothes
are snagged, so there's

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
a pretty high chance my boobs
will pop out if you keep goin'!

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
Please. Don't say the "B" word!

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
Stay focused! Figure out
what I'm stuck on...

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
And he bought it, girl.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Really?

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, hook, line, and sinker.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Wow! You--

--[WOMEN gasp]
--[UZAKI, SAKURAI gasp]

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Now a little to the left.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
No, you're other left!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Okay just brace yourself,
cuz I'm gonna do it real hard!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN scream]

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! No!
You've got the wrong idea!

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What's taking you so long?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
For a second there, I wasn't
sure how that was gonna go.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
But you nailed the assist.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] We can forget about
that whole butt thing.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] C'mon. We're gonna
be late for class.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Someone please kill me.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
After, we'll hit up
the cat café.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sobs]
Some other day.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
Heya! Are you eating solo?

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Hi.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Huh? You good?

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's hard to look her in the eye

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
after what happened
in the bushes.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
Oh! Are you embarrassed
to be eating alone again?

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
Too bad. I've got
my own plans today.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
Some people actually have
more than one friend.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
I know you're lonely,
but please don't cry.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
Oh, spare me! I happen to be
eating with a friend, too!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
Eh...? Eh?!

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] How are you not
burning yourself right now?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
You seriously have
another friend?!

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
Why would you think I didn't?

[UZAKI]
Oh, man!

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
What an unexpected
turn of events,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
I should probably go introduce
myself to this angel, huh?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
Who are you, my mother?

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center

Huh?

[FEMALE FRIEND A] You're paying
so much attention to your phone,

drink while you tidy up?

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks so much.

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] You're about
halfway through college, right?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
How's it going?

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's, uh, coming along.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] My daughter
took all kinds of courses,

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
yet she loafs around all day.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a
pretty nice life.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
Kinda jealous of her.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
I'm glad, though.
She got her credits.

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
That's one thing
she won't regret.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
This setup sure is great.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
Slow jazz played at
a moderate volume.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
The soothing aroma of coffee.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
It's almost like time
flows more slowly here.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
A place like this
eases the mind.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
--[door clatters]
--[UZAKI] Sakurai!

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
Hi there!

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I forbade you
from coming by here

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
while I'm at work!

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Aw, why're you always
being so cruel to me!

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
Besides, what's the point
if you're not here?

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
I couldn't wait one
more minute to see you!

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why not?

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
Did something happen or...?

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
My report is bad.
Help me redo it!

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh? You need... homework help?

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
I'm desperate. You were
always so good at writing.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
No can do.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
Why not? What's the problem?

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
I'm working right now.
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Then, I'll wait!

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
In that time, you could
fix it yourself.

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
I don't think I can
revise it on my own!

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
How did you even
get into college?

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'm begging you!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no. No time.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Have a heart, Sakurai.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
This girl is your underclassman.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
She needs you!

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
Your shift is done. Why don't
you help her out right here?

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
No.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
That's so nice!

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] It's not like
you'll bother anyone.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] The banter
between them is too perfect.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
I can't wait for more.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wha...?

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
A little something for my best
employee and his close friend.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
Gratis.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
It's a very kind gesture,

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
but you really didn't
have to do that.

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
Yummy! What a generous boss!

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
You can eat when you
finish your work.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Such a taskmaster.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
There's not that much to do.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Take a look at
this part sentence.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
It's too grade school-y.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
Change "I think" to,
"It's currently believed,"

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
or, "It's considered
to be true that..."

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
You need to learn to write
the way your professors

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
expect you to.

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Now me, I'd pad the
word count with,

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
"Personally speaking, it feels
though blah, blah, blah."

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
Fix that section and then
the only thing left

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
is your closing statement.
Should be easy to wrap up.

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, right!

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
Uh, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
Could you concentrate
for two seconds?

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
You're a mess.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be fun if I
came over to your place?

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
That was quick.

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
Why would you even ask me that?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I wanna see where you live!

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's not happening.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
My homelife is not for
your entertainment.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
I'll be so good! I won't
put my hands on anything.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps] Does she have
any idea how that sounds?

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
Gotta avoid this.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to
let you into my place.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
Sure you do. You said you
lived alone, that right?

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
So, you can save a
"crapton" of money

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
if I cook you dinners.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'll be super close to
campus in the mornings.

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
The pros completely
outweigh the cons.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine your
cooking is edible.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
My food is delish.
That's a bad excuse.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah, yeah.
Less talk, more revising.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Hold up, I think we need
to rewind a few steps.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
You said my place is
close to campus.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
How does that help you?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Well, since it's so convenient,
I figure I could sleep in and--

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You're not spending the night!

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
No way! You must be out
of your friggen' mind!

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
why you sound mad.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Because. Look, I'm not upset.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
It's just. What you said.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
Is there an issue?

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.283 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Letting you into
my apartment is one thing.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
But, for a girl
to stay the night...

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
That's a whole other thing.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
You don't want to do it?

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I-- What?

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
But! We could beat video games!
Co-op play all night long!

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
You dummy.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
I know you've been killing
that new game without me!

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
You're on my friends list!
I see you online.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
I'll just start popping
by after class

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
so we can play any
old day of the week!

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
You idiot! Moron! Fool!

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
Why are you so mean to me?

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
How can you be so brainless?

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] I opened this
café to get a glimpse

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
into different sorts of lives
and relationships.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:08.953 position:50% align:center
But these two are the best.
I could watch them forever.

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
If Sakurai quits,
the show will be over.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should
give him a raise.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.219 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Guess we'll see Ami next time.
