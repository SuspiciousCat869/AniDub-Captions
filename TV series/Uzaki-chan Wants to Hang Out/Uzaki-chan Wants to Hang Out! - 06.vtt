[UZAKI]
Sakurai, look! It's the ocean!

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thanks, Captain Obvious.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Shut up, you! Ha, ha!

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
We're at the beach!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
Oh gosh, so hot.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Yum. Yes, please.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] You can always
count on a summer beach trip

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
to bring people together.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
What's that?
Why're those four there?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
It all began one afternoon
a week earlier.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
In fact, it was right
here in this café.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
So, welcome, friends.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
Sit back and enjoy... the show!

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
So. I have an announcement.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
Meet our new part-timer.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.834 position:50% align:center
Your friend, Hana Uzaki.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to be part of the team!

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's the idea here?

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
I thought you were all
gung-ho on me quitting

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
so that I could finally
get some peace!

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
Aw, c'mon, don't be a hater!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have so
much fun. I know it!

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
Mm-hm.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, I am here in part
because I wanted to see

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
your dumb hater face.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Shut it!

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Real talk? I just needed
more spending money.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
Summer break's soon!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
So I asked our owner friend
and got his immediate okay!

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
I figured it might be a
lot of fun for everyone,

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
so I hired her.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's your reasoning?!

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
Listen, I understand.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
You don't think Hana
should be here.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
But she's here because
she needs a job.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
Isn't it good to support that?

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we should be
encouraging her!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
Who're you to stand in her way?

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
But... Oh, man.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
For now, just show
her the ropes.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center
They say the best way
to learn is by teaching.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll pick up
something new.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
Fine. Let's get started, then.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
You sure about this, Sakurai?

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
You really think
you can teach me?

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
Don't you even start!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
When a customer comes in,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
you should always show
them to their seat.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
You'll notice the regulars often
head to their favorite spot

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
before you can even
take them there.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
I'll be the customer.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Here. Ice water
and a hand towel.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
This is the first thing that
we bring each new patron.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
You'll want to wait till
they're comfortably seated

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
and then bring these out.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
Next, you'll say,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
"Please feel free to let me know
whenever you're ready to order."

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
Please, feel free to let me know
whenever you're ready to order.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Be careful not to
make a customer reading a menu

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
feel rushed or pressured.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Write down what they want.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
That's about how it
usually goes, got it?

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Quick question!

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Go on.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Where are the training jokes?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
There aren't any!
Shut up and learn!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying if this
act is going on forever,

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
you should really
toss in a joke.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
What do you mean act?

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
We're not putting on
some kind of skit, here!

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
So serious!

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you should try it!

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
You're getting paid
for this job!

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
Take it seriously!

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
Relax. What's the big deal?

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
It's your place!

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
What side are you on?

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, we've actually been
training her on all this stuff

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
since before you got in today.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Y'see, this was actually about
getting you all wound up!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
Great. Congrats!

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Thanks, come again!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
Sakurai! What are your
summer plans, huh?

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
You going anywhere?

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Eh. Not really.
This new game's coming out.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
Thinking I'll veg out at
home as much as possible.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Wha--?!

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
That's the same exact thing you
do for the rest of the year!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
You're really gonna waste your
precious summer break gaming?

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
Sure am! It's shaping up
to be the best summer ever!

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Who ever heard
of an athletic shut-in?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
He's friggin' hopeless!
I've got to do something!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal!

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
We're going to the
beach or a pool!

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
That's what's happening!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
--[CAFÉ OWNER] Hm?
--[ASAI gasps]

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
It's settled! Done deal!

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
I bet you haven't even gone
swimming since you graduated

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
high school, have you?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Uh... Now that
you say that, you're right.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Huh!

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
Heard you were working together,
so I'm here to watch.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
--[SAKURAI] Huh?
--[UZAKI] Wha?

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
Looks like I got
here just in time!

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
Seriously, this heat.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, Ami!

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps]

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
Over here!

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
Ha! Hey, Hana!

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center
Come on! Hang out with us!

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps]

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
[distant warzone noises]

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] A terrifying sight.
Those things are weapons.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
Look! We rented an umbrella
and set out a nice,

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
big beach blanket!

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
Go! Sit!

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Thanks!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I wish the bossman
would've come, too.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
I know. Too bad he
threw out his back.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
Oh! Lookin' for someone?

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
Sakaki stopped by, but he left
to go check out our lodging.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
I'll handle all of the details.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
What? Are you sure
about that, man?

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! We're all
going together!

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Yay, yay, yay...!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait a minute!
Where do you get off--

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
I know what you're thinking.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
But c'mon, look at them.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
Can you in good conscience
send those two alone?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
Think of the missed
opportunities!

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
[ASAI grunts]

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Typical. So now it's
up to me to look out for them.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Where is Sakurai?

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
I thought he was here with
you before, wasn't he?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he was. But not now!

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps]

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
There!

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Holy crap! How'd he
end up going out that far?

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
He got super hyped
looking out at the water,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
then he went running
into it full tilt

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
like he just couldn't
take it anymore!

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
That jerk will stop at nothing
to get his alone time.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs] I never swam
in the ocean before.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
The waves make it a lot more
challenging than a pool.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
And really fun!

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
You have a death wish?!

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
You look totally weird.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
You don't need your
goggles at the beach.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
Let alone a little swim cap!

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
You're not a lifeguard
or a grandma.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
Oh. Didn't know.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
See? It's like I
told you before.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
The whole swim-team look really
turns people off, so ditch it.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
The point here is to have fun.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
This is your precious
leisure time!

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
Forget about your old swim team!

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Why is she so ticked off?

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
Also, what were you thinking
leaving Hana behind

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
to go and swim by yourself?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Mm-hm.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What?

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
Just think.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
If you're alone, so is Hana.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.188 position:50% align:center
What if somebody hits on her?

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
How do ya think
you're gonna feel then?

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
Uh, huh?

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Do you really
wanna be responsible

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
if something happens?

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
It's only right that the guy she
came with looks out for her.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
Tell me you get this.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
Yes, master.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Start with a
swimsuit compliment.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
I doubt it'll come easy,

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
but that's what you
get for never trying.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Right. Probably fair.
Now, let me see.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
Ahem. You look really good
in that swimsuit. I like it.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
I think that blue is, like,
your color, somehow.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
Okay, now what else?

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
[ASAI whimpers]

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
Not mine, you idiot!

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI yells]

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Wow, that was intense.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
Being examined so closely
from head to toe. Doofus...

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh, Uzaki.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, what's up?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
The dolphin's almost
ready to go.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
[ASAI gasps]

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, what was that?
Did he say something?

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Uh...
No, nothing! Nothing at all!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Little embarrassed, huh?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
Will that do it?
What do you think?

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
Good job. Well done.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I remain
somewhat suspicious.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
Hey! You guys having fun?

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
I brought us a snack!

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Awesome, thank you.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
A watermelon!

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
And to eat, we'll use this.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
A bat?

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
Yep. You guessed it.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
It's time for that seaside
standard: watermelon splitting!

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Why am I doing this, again?

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
Cuz it's your first time!
Make some memories!

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Blindfold's on.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Fine. If you insist.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Come at me! From any direction!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
Gotta say it's a
heck of a lot more fun

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
to be on the guiding end.
He, he, he...

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
I think you mean the
misguiding end, right? He, he...

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
Okay, first, I say we
totally blindside him 

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
and drop-kick him
into the ocean! Ha, ha!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
[SEAL growls]

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
You're gonna lead with that?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
Geez, what kind of
games do you play?

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Okay, Uzaki,
you start off with Saku.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Roger that!

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Hang on. There's no
way I'm not filming this.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
[ASAI giggles]

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
Hello! You know I can hear
everything you say, right?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
Go on, get started, Saku!

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles]
Just look at you,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
you're like a cute
little sitting duck!

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
I will so get you for this!

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
Right. Sure. Ready?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Start!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
It's not far:
up, down, left, right, B!

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
Argh! Are you kidding
with these directions?

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
Just do it right!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Down, up, down, B,
down-right, up-left, B, 

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
up, up-left, A!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
Ah! What the hell, Uzaki?

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
You can't make me
throw a fireball!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
Seriously! Quit screwing
around and direct me!

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] She's in her element.
Nothing left for us to do.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Gotta love that.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
It's true. She has a real gift.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Dammit, this is so stupid.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
Sakurai! Start by
taking a step forward!

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
Forward and a little
to the right!

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] No, no, listen!
Go up, X, down, B, L, Y, R, A!

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
Shut up, Uzaki!

Come on. That's no accident.

Way too convenient!

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Anyway. You gonna
tell me where to go?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
Where's the melon?

grabbing one right now?

Well, I'm dead.

please get off of me?

[SAKURAI]
Man, aren't we there yet?

Would you relax?
It's just up ahead.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
What're you pouting
about over there?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
Nothing! I'm so not pouty. Hmph!

[ASAI]
Uh!

[ASAI]
Guess it was bound to happen.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
This is so dumb!

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center

that watermelon?

[ASAI] When you said you'd
handle all the details...

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Is this seriously
your summer home?

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
Welcome! Come on in, everyone!

Pick whichever room you like!

[UZAKI] I had no clue you
were this rich, Sakaki.

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I knew you
had a summer home,

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
but I didn't know
it was like this.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Cuz I invited ya
last year and ya didn't come.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
Anyway, my parents
are rich, not me.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Now go enjoy yourselves!

[UZAKI]
Whoa!

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
Would you check this out?

those click-pull things!

That's a handle!

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what's the
standard for "rich," here?

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] You can take whatever
you want from the fridge.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center
I stocked it up so
we'd have plenty.

Get a load of this meat!

Well, duh, of course I do!

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's meat.

Mm-hm, Mm-hm!

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:46.011 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] That smell! Delish!
Cookouts are the best!

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
So? What's the plan after this?

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
Oh! I brought a game. It's fun.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.057 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
Ah! Then it's a showdown!

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] No way, nerdlings!
You can do that any old time!

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
Don't forget,
it's summer break!

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
And it's night!
We're all on vacation.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
I'd say, that calls
for a little action.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Let's head to the back hills.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well, we did what you
said and followed you up here.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
Is something s'posed
to happen now?

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
It's getting crazy
dark out here.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
We should build a fire, right?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Okay, I know
it's a little cliché,

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.677 position:50% align:center
but it's really not
summer without a...

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
...courage test! Let's do it!

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
I'm out.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
No, seriously, it's cool!

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
There's this great
bluff up ahead.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
I'm done! No way!

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
'Sup, Saku? You not
into this kinda thing?

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
It's just... I don't
play horror games,

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
nor do I watch any
horror flicks, ever.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
And do you know why?

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
Because they're scary!

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
You struck a pose to say that?

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Seems like he's pretty
desperate to avoid this.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Uh... That's okay!
Man, I'm sorry!

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
I had no idea it was
such a problem for you.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
That really sucks. My bad.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
However.

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
While honesty is great and all,

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
you maybe should've reconsidered
announcing your weakness

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
to the world.

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center

Oh, really?

[SAKURAI gasps]

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
So, scary stuff is too
much for you, eh, Sakurai?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Why, I had no idea!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
Hmm...?

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
Knock it off, Uzaki.
I surrender.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
The night's too young to
throw in the towel, buddy.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
He's really scared.
He wasn't kidding!

--[UZAKI] Yoink!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Look at me! I got your phone!

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
Guess it's time to air
all your dirty laundry

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
for everyone to see!

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No! Give that back! I mean it!

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to
catch me first! See ya!

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
No! Damn you!

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Ooh, you're fast
when you wanna be!

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Quit running farther in!

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Wait up!

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
Was this the big plan?

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI sighs]

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
Actually, I envisioned the four
of us going in there together.

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
I admit, I definitely pictured
things the other way around.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
Sakurai! Don't let go.
I'm scared!

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
Good girl.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
Shoulda known. Shall we follow?

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
[owl hoots]

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
Before.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Huh?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
You told me not to
meddle with them.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
That I should look
after them instead.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] So, I thought
I'd try to create

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
the right conditions for them.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
Conditions that might nudge
them into something new.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] I knew it. I figured
it was something like that.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] But since almost
every move those two make

00:17:56.284 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
is an unexpected one,
it may not go so well.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
But, I don't get why
you're doing this.

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Why would you go
to such lengths?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Saku's actually
a really great guy.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
But he's quiet... and awkward.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
And bad at making
friends. A true loner.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
And yes, I'm aware it's not my
business, but I can't help it.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
I just wish his college life
could be more fun, you know?

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
Otherwise...
it's kind of a waste.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] So, there's that,
and other reasons...

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Other reasons, huh? 'Kay.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.965 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Oh, there they are.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

Hey, look! Sakaki and
Ami are here, see?

have some ice cream, okay?

Uh. Calling it. We're done.

Let's go, 'kay?

Come on! We can even
play a new game!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center

I... love games.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center

Even Ami dozed off.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
Guess that tracks. We did have
an active day, didn't we?

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
Everybody is all tuckered out.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Still. Seeing his
sleeping face like this

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
gets me feeling all
kinds of restless!

letting your guard down!

are you doing?

This is awkward!

[UZAKI]
He's still asleep?

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
Huh. Guess he's a cuddler, then.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
Sure didn't see that coming.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Phew, glad he's asleep.

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center

[UZAKI]
He's out cold.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
I guess he wouldn't actually
do this if he was awake.

teased the poor scaredy cat

and tired him out.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
Maybe this is okay.
For a little while, at least.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
Heh. Just for tonight.

[SAKURAI] Dang, I fell
asleep in the living room?

Cuz I woke up feeling like I
had the best sleep ever!

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
In that case, you might
want to consider investing

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
in one of those
body pillows.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center

that we missed something

extremely important.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
I won't fail again. We got this!

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
And I would bet Kakyoin's
soul that you will,

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
for sure, find a way
to screw it up.
