[TSUKI] Darjeeling? Or maybe
chamomile would be better?

Oh, I just don't know!

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
I really should have
asked Hana which tea

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
would be best before
she left earlier.

Don't you understand?

Please. Can you imagine
if you were being serious?

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
I'm far too old for you.

Listen, Mr. Upstanding Guy.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.768 position:50% align:center
I get that you wanna return what
I paid ya for the mess I made,

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
but my mom's already
said you don't have to.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.274 position:50% align:center
Stop. You gave me too much.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
If you won't take it, then I'll
just have to return it directly.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
It's only too much because you
bought such a cheap replacement.

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center

to get a good one!

Hold on a second,
are you actually nervous?

Don't tell me, is this your
first time ever visiting

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
a girl's house?

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
That's correct. And I think
I might just throw-up.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Boy, you surrender
fast when you're cornered.

into a haunted house!

gobbled up or anything.

Are you only doing this
because there will be cats?

awful lot about you!

such a penetrating glare!

This is no ordinary fellow.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
He's so... intense.

Also, she never told me her
older friend was a boy!

welcome here.

Thank you, ma'am. I'm Sakurai.

I owe you.

You replaced my futon.

I'm so grateful.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center

well-mannered than he looks.

[SAKURAI]
However.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
I'd like to return some
of what you gave me

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center

money and be on my way.

Of course. We mustn't keep him!

[TSUKI giggles nervously]

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Okay. I think I
understand the situation.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
You're saying that Hana offered
too much money for the futon,

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
so you want to give
back the rest?

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, UZAKI]
That's right.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
I tried to give it to Hana,
but she wouldn't take it.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
I hate to barge in on you,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
but returning it directly
was the right thing to do.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center

He used my name!

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
Honey? A word?

me is you're spending time

with a "good friend at college"!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center

the night at a boy's place,

[UZAKI]
That hurts!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center

Shoulda seen this coming.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
He's one of the
good ones, though!

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
Really, I swear!

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Young lady, you know
that's not the point!

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
You might be just fine,
but Sakurai's still...

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
Well, he's... You know!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Can't even argue.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
I think I get what's happening.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
This girl of mine has actually
been a terrible bother to you, 

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
hasn't she?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, don't say that.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
But, yes. Please, do continue.

[UZAKI]
Sakurai!

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
What the heck, dude?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
So, my looking after you is
nothing but a big bother?

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn't say
that's exactly true.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
About one time out of ten,
I'm grateful for it.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
That's a crap average! You suck!

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] I think I'm getting
a pretty clear idea 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
of how their time
together has been going.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
Goodness. They do seem
awfully close, though.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
I think Sakurai must
be good for Hana.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
Both as an upperclassman
and as a friend.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
He may look a
little frightening,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
but he seems normal enough.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
All that worry for nothing.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
Still. My Hana, bringing a
boy home to meet me?

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
It could be that I'll have some
other things to worry about 

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
before too long!

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
Or not!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI gasps]

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Am I imagining it or is
Sakurai staring right at me?

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
Well, not at me...

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
At my... chest?

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] His eyes are fixed on
this one spot. Shameless!

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
We barely met and he's
already after my body?

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
He couldn't possibly want
me <i>and</i> my daughter?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Man, I love cats.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
You ready to
start petting, or what?

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Hana!

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
I mean... if it's okay.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
What? Sakurai!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
You probably can't just yet.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
She's on high alert.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
She needs to approach you.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.776 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
"Probably"? "Yet"?!

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
She's kinda shy with strangers.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
What is she talking about?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
If you stop by enough,
she'll get used to you.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Believe me, before you know it,

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
she's gonna end up
chasing <i>you</i> down!

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Absolutely not!
There is no chance of that!

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
What are you even saying?

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
And right in front
of your mother?!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
Man. Not gonna fly today.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
But soon... I wanna hold her.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
Now that we've settled things,
guess I'll get going.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Uh.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
What? You're leaving so soon?

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Yeah. I don't want
to overstay my welcome.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
Well, I um...

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Then why don't
I come to your place?

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
We can get some gaming in!

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Sure, whatever.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
Sorry to intrude.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

Why is my heart pounding?

He used to be an athlete,
