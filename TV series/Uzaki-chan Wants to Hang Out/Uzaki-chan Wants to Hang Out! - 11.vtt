00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.763 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hey, loner!
You gonna be home today?

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
And if you are, can I come over?

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Great! I'll be right there! Bye!

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
[dial tone]

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
Ah, it seems like Uzaki's visits

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
have gone from rare
to a daily thing.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
Whatever, it's not worth
fighting it. I'm done.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
Although, I hate
that she's always

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
leaving her junk
lying around like this!

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
I'm totally gonna have to
say something to her soon.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] There she is.
Dirty little menace...

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Surprise! Check out
what I brought for your place--

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
a jumbo beanbag! So cute,
right? See, it's a frog!

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's too big!

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
There's a little frog, too!

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.934 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Okay, I hate how cute that is.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.238 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So, what's your plan, here?

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
My plan for what?
You mean, like, for my life?

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
Basically not to sweat it.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
People like the person behind
you are just passing through.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
[screams] You know
that's not what I meant!

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
Would you cut it out? Jeez!

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
Look around. Your stuff is
taking over my apartment!

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
I want you to start carting some
of it home with you today!

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
This is outta control.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
What's with the freakin'
enormous beanbag, anyway?

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I mean, think
about it, I'm always

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
sitting on your hard wood floor
for our gaming marathons.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
My butt hurts! Sorry, is that
inconvenient for you?

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
And anyway, isn't it the
host's one responsibility

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
to make his living space
welcoming and comfortable?

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Or would you rather
be responsible

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
for my butt cramping up?

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
Does that bring you
some kind of pleasure?

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Are you really
complaining now?

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I must
plead not guilty

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
to decorating without a permit!

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
Fine, yes, you win.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
The beanbag makes sense,
so it can stay.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
But the rest?
This is a big problem!

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Uh? Uh...
I guess it has piled up, huh?

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend
it's not your fault!

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
Time for you to choose
what stays and what goes.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
Ugh! You're killin' me.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
And no fun until we're finished.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
Everything that you don't need
goes into this garbage bag.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
What you do need
goes home with you.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Fine...

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
This?

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Toss it.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
These?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Nope.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
--[SAKURAI] This crap?
--[UZAKI] Nuh-uh.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
See?! You don't even
want any of this stuff!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
Don't bring it to my
place--throw it away!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
I'll try? [laughs]

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's just super-hard
to make up your mind, you know?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
And there's one thing
that's really bugging me.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, this?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
Aw, are you kidding?
It's so fun!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
See, you blow through
this little thing here.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
Like so...

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
[inhaling, exhaling]

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
[laughs] The best, right?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Nope. Toss.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
Why, though? You know
that thing's hilarious!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
It'll be a hit on Halloween!

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't care. Besides,

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
you know you only left it here
because you didn't need it.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Fair enough.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
That was easy! See,
I knew it was garbage!

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
It's like... Sometimes I have to

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
show a thing to you first
before I can settle it.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Ugh. Nice and roomy
again, just how I like it.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]
I'm so tired!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The only reason
it was some huge chore

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
was because of the amount of
crap you'd brought over.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Great, here we go.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
Like how you bought all those
extra phone chargers.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
You just don't think
before you do things.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Yep.
It's definitely lecture time.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you even listening?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I'm thirsty! Think I'm
gonna go grab a drink!

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
No way! Don't you run!

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
I'm not even close to being
finished with you!

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
See, this is what you do! Uh?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
What's with the bag? Huh?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
Did you put it in there?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Oh, uh... That's
actually something else.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding, Uzaki?
So now you're storing random

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
stuff in my frid--

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
No, wait, is that...?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
Yeah! [laughs]

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd cook for today.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
It's been a while,
so it seemed like a fun idea.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
Listen. I suck. Sorry.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
I, uh... Should've given
you more credit than that.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Tell me.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
Would you like fish or beef?
For the main dish?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Fish sounds great.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
Apologies for earlier.
And... this is really delicious.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm enjoying this.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
Your sincerely remorseful
side is very charming.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Man, he's so easy.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Hey, Sakurai?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah?

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
What're your thoughts
on food prep?

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why not?

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
It'd be a big help
if you could handle

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
some of the cooking
around here, too.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
But I don't--

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh? So,
you're gonna cook, now?

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you were a chef!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
You sure you can?
It's not as easy as it looks!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI growls]
I'll do it.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
Uh. Lovely.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
You're for real?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know you don't
think I can do this, okay?

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
But I'll have you know, I cook
for myself like once a month!

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.476 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Um... What is that?

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
It's spaghetti.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, wow...

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
What on earth...?

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
It's, uh, really interesting.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You can go ahead and laugh.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That was way too much!

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Whad'ya mean? I'm just
doing what you told me to do!

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
Stop it! This isn't my favorite!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Ugh, enough!
Would you quit fighting?

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI pants]

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI panting]

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
Harder. It's best
if you're rough.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Yes. You're a natural, Sakurai.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

[panting]

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
Enough! My hands are so tired!

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
Man. Udon dough is no joke.
Kneading it is really hard work!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
I was surprised to see you here,

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
for a crash course
in the kitchen.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.926 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry. I'd intended
to do it at my place.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have the tools. So I
told him he could come here.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
And besides, Mom, you were
my cooking instructor!

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
Thank you in advance
for your help.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI gasping]

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's do it!
Just try to keep up, will ya?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
It must be nice having
those big, strong muscles.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
He does have that going for him.
Big meathead that he is.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hana!

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's okay.
I get it all the time.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
Do you, really?

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well... you know...

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, though.
For Hana's nasty mouth.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Wow. I've been having
a normal conversation

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
with him all this time!

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI gasps]

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Now I see!

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
It's because Sakurai's
focused on the udon.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
His eyes are intense
but they're looking away!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
When I'm not staring
directly into them,

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
he's actually easy to talk to!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
I hope this is helping.
Glad you're here.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, it's great. Thank you.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] Let the dough sit
for about 20 minutes.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
Well, I have some laundry
I need to put away, so...

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
I'll leave the rest
to you kids.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uhh...

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Want somethin'
to drink, Sakurai?

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
I bet you worked up a sweat.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sounds good.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Kitties...!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
I was a little anxious at first,

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
but I managed to hold a
conversation with him.

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
Turns out Sakurai
is a kind person,

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
and sincere, just as
his co-workers said.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
And now I know I'm fine
as long as I avoid his eyes.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
Yes, I've made
great strides today,

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
and so has he!

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
Think, now he actually
wants to spend time

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
learning how to cook!
Kids these days.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
He'll make someone
a great husband!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI giggles]

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'm telling you,
Sakurai, it's fine. Go ahead!

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
You said you really wanted
to get in some petting, right?

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Petting?!

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Not with high-alert
mode still active.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to scare anyone off.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] I mean, okay, yes, fine,
maybe I am scared, but I...

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
It's not like that, I, ah--

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Nah, you're all good!
That one likes you.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
She keeps sneakin' peeks, so...

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI] I was looking at him,
sure, he was right next to me!

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
But I wasn't looking
at him like that!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Just go for it! Bam!

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Hana?!

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] No. I think I should
be more of a gentleman.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
Oh, Sakurai!

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, I thought I was
warming up to all of this!

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
But I do not understand
kids these days!

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
Why-oh-why does Hana keep
putting me in these situations?

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
No. I can't give up.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
There's still time!
I can make this right!

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
I'm back.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
I'll put them on the right path.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Show them the error
of their ways!

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
Let's... boil some udon.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
[TSUKI]
That is an adult's duty!

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
Homemade's the best!

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Right? I know!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI chuckles]

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You promise
it's your treat today?

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks for the cooking
lessons by the way.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
They rocked.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
I've been wantin' to try rock
climbing, like, forever!

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
You're the best!

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm glad you're so excited.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
When we went swimming
at the beach recently,

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
it made me realize how much
I miss being active.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
So, I'm pumped.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
Most pick-up sports are things
like baseball and frisbee golf.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
But rock-climbing strengthens
your entire body at once!

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
Which is a good thing,

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
'cause I betcha don't get
your body rocked much.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Phrasing...

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
In rock climbing, we scale the
wall by using holds like this.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
So, in general, you start
from one labeled S,

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
and then climb to another one
labeled G that's the same color.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
Sounds easy, right?

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
You'll start out with holds
meant for all four limbs.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Look for the same color labels

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
and follow those as you
make your way up.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
All right! Good!

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groaning]

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Okay! Excellent work, people!

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
What'd ya think. You hooked?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
That was a blast!

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
[coughing] Yeah, I feel
like I'm dying here.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Maybe a few more sessions.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even think.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
My muscles were about to give
out on me the whole time,

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
so I was pretty much
just scrambling in a panic

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
like some kind of
defective spider monkey.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I'm not sure
this is for me.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
Really? Weird, I think
I've found a new hobby.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no doy.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
You're practically glowing,
and I kinda despise you for it.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
I knew I was right.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
You don't get enough
exercise at all.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI growls]

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're a super freak

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
who thinks climbing walls
for no reason is fun!

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get all
that energy, anyway?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
I work out in my spare time--
burpees, mountain climbers...

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
Ha. You're just mad
'cause you thought

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
you could one-up me
in here and got spanked.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I am not mad at all!
What's wrong?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
You train too much?
No blood going to your brain?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
Ah. Oh, I see you're
still rarin' to go!

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I bump up the
difficulty for this next one?

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] The rules are
the same as last time,

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
but now you'll be
climbing a higher wall.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
This one is for rope-climbing.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
You'll be wearing a cable
and harness as you head up.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'll go first.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
You try and catch your breath.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI growls]

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I see now.
It's about endurance.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
The height makes things
tougher than before.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
All right. I'm really
starting to enjoy this!

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]
Ah, crap! Where's my foothold?

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
Okay, just take a second
and assess your surroundings.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
Sakurai! Just move
your other leg first.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
If you initiate with your
right foot instead,

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
it'll be smooth sailing.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, where to, though?

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] There's a spot
above your right knee.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I don't quite feel it. Where?

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
His arms are taking
his full weight.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
You sure it's his first time?

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
He looks like an ugly butterfly.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
That's the most fun
I've had in a long time!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You call what you
were doing up there fun?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
You're a meathead if
I've ever seen one.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
So, have you recovered, Uzaki?

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI growls]

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] He's having so much fun,
my jabs don't faze him!

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
You sure you don't need
to rest a little longer?

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI growls]
Shut up! No way, bro!

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
You just watch!
I can so do this!

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Jeez, what are
you screaming about?

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
You okay? Do you need help?

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
I so can't do this.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
She looks like a chrysalis.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'll just stay up
here forever, I guess.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
Can't go forward, can't go back.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
This is my life now.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's a weird way to pout.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
I'll let you down with the rope.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Please just relax your body.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
Was that too much?

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
There, there. Poor thing.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
