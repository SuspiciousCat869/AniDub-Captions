00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
- Oh, really?
- Shuta, we're packing

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
- Mm-hmm!
- Shuta, we're packing

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
- You'll be so awesome!
everything up and leaving.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
- Come help!
- Coming, Mom!

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
- Can I help out, too?
- Yeah!

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
[birds chirping]

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
- The hero show got canceled
without us knowing.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
- It sucks.
- Oh?

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
- I really liked it.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
Huh?
- Hey, part-timer!

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
One Sunrise!
- I'm not a part-timer!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
Listen, the name's Shuta Aoi,
you understand?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
- I don't care.
Just hurry it up.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
- All right.
I get it.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
- [chomping]

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
- Well, kid, you like our
signature Golden Sunrise bun?

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
It's tasting, right?
- Mmm.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
It's fine.
both: Huh?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Don't understand.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
Tastes different
than the usual bread does.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
Huh, okay.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
I guess it is slightly different
from the ones Dad bakes.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
- It's shocking given
it's your signature pastry.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
- I'm only filling in for my dad

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
while he's on vacation
in France.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
I'm not serious about it.
- Mm-hmm.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
- Sheesh.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
What the heck is up with Mari?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
[phone beeps]

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
Huh?
Chest?

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
Chest.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
Chest.
This feels off.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
- Almost time for us to switch!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
Shu?
Uh?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[squeals]
Oh, I'm sure you have stuff

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
going on but don't you think
that's taking things a bit far

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
in the living room?

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
That's not what I'm--
you've got it wrong.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
It isn't--it's like--
you know!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
- Like what?
- Well, you know.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
It's like, you know, uh...

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
- Uh, oh!

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
Uh, but Shu, what do you--

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
- Oh, I think
you're misunderstanding.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
I misunderstood?

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]
[both gasping]

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
- Kozue?
[ringing continues]

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
Kozue, you okay?

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You're crying.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
- Dad's graffiti.
- Huh?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
It's Carneades.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Finally he--huh?
- [crying]

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!
Why, Shu?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
- I wish I knew.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
Whoever did this to Kaba's art,
I swear that I'll catch him.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
- [exhales]

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
[phone trilling]

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
- Dammit!

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
Ran and Koki
still aren't answering.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
Great, so neither one is willing
to help the other out

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
after all that's happened.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Nope, nope, nope!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
[shouting]

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Why aren't they answering
when I call?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
[crickets chirping]

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Huh?
Yumihariyu.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Kinako!

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
- Here you go.
- Take your time.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
- Kinako!
- Huh?

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!
- Kinako.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
Do you have a way to reach Ran?
- [shushes]

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
- Uh--
- You can't ask that so loudly.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Right now Ran
is a wanted suspect.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
- Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
But you can find him?
- Sorry, can't.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
- Oh, what?
- Can you believe that?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
I kept it a secret I
was always visiting DoRed.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
So Ran said that since
I haven't been identified yet,

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't let me
go underground with him!

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
They were gone before I knew it.
- Uh--

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
- I can't reach them
no matter how much I try!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
- Oh, I see.
- How come?

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
Did something bad happen?
- Uh, yeah.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
That picture of Kaba
in Minato Park

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
has been painted over
by someone.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
- Oh, that's part
of the graffiti war.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
- Graffiti war?
- Mm, here.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Take a look at my phone.
- Huh?

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
- You know how DoRed's
been making appeals about

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
the dangers of cPhones lately?

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
- Oh, I mean, kinda?

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
- [exhales]

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
They've gained followers
but they face opposition.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
A lot of DoRed graffiti
gets overwritten--

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
basically painted over,

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
and the individual who's been
painting over the DoRed art

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
is that guy,
Carneades,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
who hacked the TV stations
a while back.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
- You know about Carneades?
- Hmm?

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
- I do up to the point
most people know him.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
I don't understand that guy.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
He hacked every monitor on
the entire island,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
and now he's overwriting DoRed.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
He tells us to "determine
the future."

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
Do you get him?
- I don't.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center
I wish I could put it together.

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, I know, right?

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
The fact that his objective
is so unclear

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
is a big part of all
the discussions on the Internet,

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
and he's profusely praising
the KANAE System

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
with graffiti bombs
so there's rumors Carneades

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
is working for the government.
Here.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
The graffiti war
is being featured

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
on news web sites everywhere.

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
- Either way--
- Hmm?

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
- I can't let him overwrite
the graffiti DoRed did for Kaba.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
- [exhales]

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
Shuta, does that mean
you're going

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
to side with DoRed, then?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
I didn't mean it that way.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
- I'm positive Ran would
be absolutely thrilled

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
if you were to side with DoRed.
You know?

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, I'll think about it.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
It's bath time.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
- So Carneades is entangled
in a graffiti war?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
What do you make
of all of this?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
- He's committing crimes
using current affairs for fun.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
This graffiti war seems
to be a diversion.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
You know, Tsuzuragawa,

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
the other day when you guys
showed Asumi to me,

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
you looked like you wanted
to tell me something.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
You don't have to speak
if you don't want to,

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
but if you can let me help you
shoulder that burden,

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
then there really
is no other way.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
I believe I can handle it.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
- Dammit!

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Too much ground.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
I can't cover it all alone.
Hmm?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
Is that Miss Tsuzuragawa?

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.262 position:50% align:center
Miss Tsuzuragawa!
- Mr. Aoi.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
- Good evening.
So, uh, is Koki doing okay?

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center
I've been trying to contact him

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
but I just can't get through on
the phone.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
- I believe he's very busy due

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
to the recent
department transfer.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
- Transfer?

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
- Koki has been promoted
to the team lead in charge

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
of KANAE System operations.
- Oh, yeah.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
Mari was saying she
saw something on the TV.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
- Koki heads analysis
of the vast amount

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
of empirical data gathered
by the KANAE System.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
- Data analysis.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
- In the new year,

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
24th ward will be incorporated

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
into Tokyo and must acclimate
to the laws of Japan.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Mr. Aoi.

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
- Uh--

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
- The mayor is devoting all
his efforts

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
to pass
the Preventative Arrest bill

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
prior
to the ward's incorporation.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
- That's the end
of the year vote, isn't it?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
- Everybody stands firm
in their beliefs,

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
carrying some kind of burden.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the same way?

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
- [exhales]

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
- Mr. Aoi?

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
- Please tell Koki
to at least answer his phone!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
- In some instances,

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
one's beliefs can
be obstructions to justice.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
Thus only true ideals
can be allowed

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
to continue existing.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
Do not judge our merit!

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Don't hesitate
to defend yourself!

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Hesitation is the real evil
against those that seek strife.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Creation's always an act
of destruction in the beginning.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
- Hey, kid, this one's fresh out
of the oven!

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's tasty!

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
- [chomps]

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
Ordinary.
- What?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
it's ordinary?

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Why I oughta--
[all laughing]

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be like how
a chest feels,

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
but I've never touched anyone's
chest other than my own chest!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
Ah, man, I just don't get this.

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
And I've never been very good
at thinking things through.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
- Shu, look.
He did it again.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
Come on.
The church got bombed?

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
Shu, you're being such
a pervert!

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
- Damn, Kaba's been
overwritten again?

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
- Hey, do you remember when
that picture was painted?

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
- I saw the guy paint
it late last night.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
- Seriously?
What does he look like?

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
We've got a rule we're

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
not supposed to tell stuff
like that to Shanty outsiders.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
Especially if it's
to a part-timer

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
who seriously sucks
at baking his own bread.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
The usual Golden Sunrise
is way tastier.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm begging ya.
Can you make it better?

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
- [groans]

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
Can't argue, can I?

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
- Shu, are you going to look
for Carneades again tonight?

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
- Huh.
- Hey, Shu!

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
- Geez, Earth to Shuta!
Come on!

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Mari's talking to you!
- Huh?

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.
Hi, Mari.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
- Y--You okay?
- [whimpers]

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
Shuta's no good.
He's way too sick.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
- Ah, Sunrise.
Boobies.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
Boobs?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
- Uh...

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
- Uh, I'm gonna head out.
- [shudders]

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
He's seriously a goner!
[door creaks open and closed]

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
Louis is coming back tonight
so we'll have

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
to hold a family meeting!

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
- [moans]

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
Hey, have you noticed Shu
behaving strangely recently?

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
- He's very strange.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
He stared at my boobs.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
- He looked at mine, too.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
- Miss Tsuzuragawa.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
we've seen you here.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
- I felt like getting refreshed.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
- You always look as if
you're way too busy.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
- By the way,
I don't believe Shu's

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
been sleeping
very much recently.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why
he's been so weird?

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
- Well, he seems to be brooding
over all sorts of things.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.062 position:50% align:center
He's never been too good
at thinking, either.

00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
- [breathing heavily]

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
Dammit!
It's everywhere!

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
Carneades this,
Carneades that!

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
I don't care!

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just hurry up
and show yourself?

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
- Shuta.

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Still acting like a hero
chasing after him like this.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
- Koki.
- [grunts]

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
- Man, this is infuriating.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
Just how long will the war be?

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
- [mimics buzzing noise]

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
War is not the right answer.
- [gasps]

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.220 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
- War has a winner
and a loser.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
But how do you decide who wins
and loses a graffiti war?

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
Who's gonna profit the most
from this conflict being

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
the talk of the town?

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
- You're asking me who?

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
- Yeah,
and the answer's us.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
See?

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
- Whoa!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
I had no idea!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
So cool!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
- Shu.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.575 position:50% align:center
No matter how hard
you chase him,

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
the real Carneades won't ever be
where you're looking for him.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
- They're not picking up
their phones again today either.

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
- Well, dang.
You look exhausted.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
- What are you doing here
in Shantytown?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
- I heard you've been burning
the midnight oil trying

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
to wear two hats.
- I'm not tired at all.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
- Oh, really?

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
Because you seem distracted
like you're trying

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
to escape from something.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Is the thing you're running
from perhaps that fire

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
at Takara Elementary School?
[fist bangs on wall]

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
- Chikuwa, say one more word.
I swear--

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
- You realize the 24th ward
is changing, right?

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
You can keep living in the past
but growing up means letting go

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
of possibilities
that could have been.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
It's high time you thought
about how you're going

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.161 position:50% align:center
to use yourself as a resource
for this city.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
This rate the ward
will leave you behind.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
I don't think Asumi
would want that.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
Hey, shut your mouth!

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
- Hey, um, are you okay?

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
- What the hell am I doing?
- [gasps]

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
Is anything wrong?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
- Sorry, I'm gonna go take
a bath.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
I don't understand at all.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
Am I doing it
in the wrong way somehow?

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
You must be listening to me
from somewhere out there, right?

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Please, answer me, Asumi.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
- Shuta.
- Asumi.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
- When you get older,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
you should be a hero
who brings smiles

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
to people as well!
- Oh, really?

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
- Mm, yeah.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
I was telling my mom
all about you earlier.

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
Delivering that bread
to everybody in place of Ran.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
You looked just like a hero.
- Oh, you mean the crusts.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
- The reason Takara Food Bank

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
got started was because of you,
Shu.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
I've made up my mind!

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
In the future
I'll become a hero!

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
I'll make everybody smile!

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I'm gonna have to run
the bakery as well.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
Ah, geez!
I can't choose!

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
Ah!
- Why not do both?

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- You'll bake bread

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
and be a hero.
That would be totally amazing,

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
you know?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[vacuum sucking]
- [humming]

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me, Shuta?

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
Huh?
He's gone?

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, wait!
This can't be!

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shuta!
Please wake up!

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
He's not breathing!

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so sorry, Ran!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Mari!

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
It's you!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
Mr. Aoi, Shuta's not breathing
right now!

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
- Oh!
