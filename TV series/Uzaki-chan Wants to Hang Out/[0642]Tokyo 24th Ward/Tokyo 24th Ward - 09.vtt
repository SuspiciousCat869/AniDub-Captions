- [gasps]
Sakiko.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
The accident then was merely
a new way forward.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
Don't take responsibility
just because I chose

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
to leave research.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
- I have to.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
Without all your research,

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
my life would have ended
that day.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
I want to repay the favor
to everyone who helped me.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
- Ideally, I wanted
to do research with you.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
Why'd you become
a school teacher?

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- I mean, it was so sudden.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
Did Mr. Suido influence you?
- [exhales]

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that's part of it.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
Gori always had an interest
in better education.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.366 position:50% align:center
He says he's going to create

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
a comprehensive K
through 12th school

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
and he's currently
making appeals

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
all over the place.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
That's not all, though.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
I thought about it while looking
at the graffiti Zeroth drew.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
Both cultivating and harvesting
are extremely important jobs.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
My job now is to cultivate.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
I'll leave the harvesting
to you.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
[chuckles, grunts]

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
I start work here today.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
My names Sakiko Tsuzu--

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Am I here too early?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
- [groans]
- Huh?

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
- [groans]

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're the new girl?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
- Uh, I'm sorry.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
I have the wrong room.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
- No, uh, you're fine!

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
You probably came
to the right place.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
No, you did.
I'm sure of it.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
- I have no interest in clubs
with strange activities.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
- This isn't part
of any club activities.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
It's my job.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
Part time job, actually.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
The lab has really
bright fluorescents,

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
so I couldn't sleep.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
I'm Wataru.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
Well met, Sakiko.
- Please call me Tsuzuragawa.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
- Wow, so quick to correct me.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
Well, you can just wait here
for now.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
You want a coffee?
- That would be fine.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
- You like it black, Sakiko,
or--

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
- Tsuzuragawa would appreciate
some milk.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
- You like it?
- Did you make it?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
- Yep, I burned the midnight oil
to build it.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
Our local hero,
Mr. 24.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
I protect the peace
of the 24th ward 24/7!

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
- [slurps]

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
It's a sloppy finish job.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
- What?

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
I put so much work
into this thing.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
- I know someone
who would be able

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
to make it properly.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
- How so?

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
They're like a sculptor
or something?

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
Aren't places like that
ridiculously expensive, Sakiko?

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
- Tsuzuragawa.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
The person I know doesn't decide
based on price

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
but whether or not
it's worth doing.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
If he resonates with how
you really feel,

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll make it.
- [groans]

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
- Even for free.
- [whimpers]

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
Wow.
Amazing.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
All these paintings
were made by you?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
- My main style's graffiti.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
'Kay, all done.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
- Ah?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Looks good!

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center
Feels like someone who would
fight evil 24 hours in a row!

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
- Right?

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
- Is the horn area's design
an homage to Muscle Boy?

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
- Oh, you noticed.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
I wanted to put in a nod
to Japanese hero designs.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
- I can't keep up when guys
branch off like this.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
- Ooh, what's this?
- Carneades.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
He'd be your hero's nemesis
who mercilessly demands

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
Mr. 24 make a choice.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
- Oh, yeah!
Gotcha!

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a dramatically
compelling narrative!

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll use that.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
You've helped me out quite
a bit, Zeroth.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
So can you make 3D versions,
too?

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
- I'll happily do it
for the Kasuga alumni

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
but there is one way you can pay
me back, Chikuwa.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
Take care of her while I'm away
from Japan.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- Going overseas?

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
Where to?

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
- I want to experiment
with graffiti in New York,

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
and luckily I've got
financial support.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
- I love New York!

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
- You'll be all right
on your own?

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, I can read simple words
and phrases now.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
I can make due
in day-to-day life.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
- But--
- I have to go.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
God's sign made me
stop research.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
Just like how you're changing
the world with your programs,

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna change
the world through my artistry.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
- [exhales]

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
- Changing
the world through art?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
That's never occurred
to me before now,

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
but when I look at the paintings
you've done in here,

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
I feel certain you can do it!

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
- And what are you going to do?

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
Me?

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
Let me think a minute.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll continue to be a hero
after graduating college.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center
- What?
You'll be able to graduate?

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
- [laughs]

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
Golden Sunrise!

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
- Two years since
Takara Food Bank began,

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
It's been on the news
as a model case

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
of community outreach
and volunteering.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
It's been a big help
to Shantytown.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
- Takara Shopping Street
is to thank.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
- Momma!
- Mm?

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
- I got a Golden Sunrise!
Try it!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
Here!
- Thank you very much.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
[chomps]
- You, too, Dad.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
- Well, thank you!

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[chomping]

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
Mmm!
Tasty!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, right?

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Asumi!

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
Time to go!
- Come on,

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
or we're gonna leave you behind.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
- Oh, wait for me!

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
- Don't worry.
- I'm happy.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
- We won't leave you behind.
- Oh?

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.438 position:50% align:center
About what?
- I mean,

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
if I was a researcher,

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I would still
be trapped in a distant ideal,

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
unable to notice all
the people around me.

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
Gori, thanks so much

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
for giving me encouragement
back then.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
- No, thank you.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
I created Suido Academy because
of the decision you made, Kanae.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
- [giggles]

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
- But we still have
a long way to go.

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
- Yes, that's true.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
A lot to do.
Oh, uh...

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
- Kanae?

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
- I've just remembered I have
to do something.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Could you help them clean up
without me?

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
- Uh, of course.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
- Whew, hot.
So hot.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
- Good job out there.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else
to pack up?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center
- Thanks for lending a hand.
I really appreciate it.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
- It was Mrs. Kanae's request.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
- [laughs]
No need for you to blush.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
[crows cawing]

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
- Excuse me.

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
Are you here for the food bank?

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center

Just shut up

the future which I also sought--

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
was not supposed
to be like this.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
I see what Kanae tried
to achieve.

If we can complete her work,

to happen.

Listen.
I'll fund the whole project.

Please finish Kanae's system

- [exhales]
- Mrs. Kanae,

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
she asked me to take care
of Koki and Asumi

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
if she passed away.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
I request permission
to periodically check in

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
on how they're doing, sir.

- Oh, I'm sorry I surprised you.
[grunts]

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
- Why are you here?

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
- Employment.
I got a job.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
You're the one who told me,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
"Don't sit around forever,"
Sakiko.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
- Tsuzuragawa.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
You act as if we're still
in college.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
- Hold on.
Are you and I coworkers?

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
- No, we are not.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
We're borrowing space
at the moment.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
I had research
for the information center.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
- Still so cold.
Huh?

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
What's this?
- Give that back.

- [grunts]

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
I know that.
Kanae.

Oh, hey.
It's been a while.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, of course.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm doin' pretty well.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
I work at SARG.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
- Oh, really?

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
You quit being a hero?

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
- I couldn't protect someone
who's right in front of me.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
I'm nowhere near a hero.

- [exhales]

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
- If I want
to protect other people,

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
I have to grow up.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
When I get back I need
to be careful

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
to not get arrested
for destruction

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
of private property.
- [laughs]

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
I'll be waiting, cuffs ready.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
- By the way,
how's Sakiko?

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
- Good.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
It looks like she somehow
moved on with things.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
She went straight from college

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
to the ward's central
information center.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
- What?

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
- Seems she's planning something
with Gori Suido.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
The blueprints for Cornucopia
from the lab.

Hello?
You there, Zeroth?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
- Here at the famed
Suido Academy,

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
all of the teachers who will
be lending their full support

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
to chairman Gori Suido.

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Suido, who is going
to be running for mayor

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
of the ward,

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
has come here to speak directly
to you ab--

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
[door opens]
Huh?

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
Who are you?
What do you want?

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
- You're ignoring
Kanae's wishes?

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
what you're doing

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
is what's best for the world?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
That system's design suffers
a major flaw!

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
- You think I don't know that?

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
- Kanae was my wife.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
I was closer to her than anyone.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
She agonized about abandoning
her research because

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
it was a valuable system.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
- What you are doing
is inhumane.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
- I will always strive
for what's best.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Faults can be fixed
with advances in technology.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.609 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuragawa is advancing

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
the project
with the same intent.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
- I never trusted you
from the very beginning!

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
Someday you'll claim this
is for everyone's happiness

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
and sell your soul to the devil!
- [grunts]

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
The KANAE System,
it's doing well?

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
- It's a rush job

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
but the underground
information center

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
is under construction.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
- Any alternatives
to the biological brain?

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
- No prospects as of yet.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
- So we have failed.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
Only a human brain can serve
as the heart of the system.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
The KANAE System's core.

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
- It's my fault we have
no alternative brain.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
If I need to--
- Don't do anything foolish.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
If that were an option,

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
I would have done it long ago.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
But Kanae wouldn't
have wanted that.

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
No one should.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
- Please!

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
It's about saving
the Takara Elementary School.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
- [groans]

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
I told you an abandoned school
with no management

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
is a dangerous place.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
- Look at this!
- [grunts]

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
- We all drew it.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
- This is...

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
- Everyone is amazing, truly.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
We've all got tons
of ideas to preserve

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
and reuse every inch
of the Takara Elementary School,

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
and I want you to support

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
a preservation movement
as mayor.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
- Well, but--
- I beg you.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
This is something we need
for the health of the 24th ward.
