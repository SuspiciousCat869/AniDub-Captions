00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Sakurai Shinichi
started working here

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
part-time last year.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
He looks a little scary,
but he takes his work seriously

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
and our regulars only have
good things to say about him.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
But most of all...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
...that boy is fine.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Gah! I can't stop staring!

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
Look at him,
he's basically perfect!

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
He looks thin, but he's got some
real muscles under there!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me, handsome!
We're ready to check out now.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
I doubt he's even noticed this,

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
but he has plenty of
fans around here.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
Gosh, you're so tall, Sakurai!
How tall are you?

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
About five eleven.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's impressive!

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
Have you ever played any sports?

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Just the
swim team in high school.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[HOUSEWIFES]
Oh my, how interesting!

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] I love it! Yes!
Great questions, ladies!

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
And swimmers are so hot.
I mean, you can see everything!

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Look at me, picking up
juicy tidbits here at work!

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
I'm making so much progress!

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.166 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Your heart doesn't really seem

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
to be in it today, Ami.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Huh?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.296 position:50% align:center
Getting lost in
thought is normal.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
But try to remember,
you are on the clock.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
You gotta be careful
when doing busy-work.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
You could easily lose track
of what you're doing.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm sorry.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.310 position:50% align:center
I understand
your interest, though.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
Now go ahead and clear
that empty table, okay?

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Dad, I will.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.693 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] Dad has this way of
coming across all gentle 

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.570 position:50% align:center
and sweet even when he's
being strict as heck.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
But how can I concentrate
when fate brought Sakurai

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:55.949 position:50% align:center
and me together today?

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.575 position:50% align:center
[door clatters]

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
Sakurai! Hey!

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So. Back again, huh?

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
Don't you have
anything better to do?

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
Well, I could ask you
the same thing, 

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
working this hard on
a Sunday and all!

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Wait, what? Who's this?

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Hana.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Dad knows her, too?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] 
Up top! Yeah!

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Ugh. Remember your dignity!

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Peak time's just
ended, so it's pretty slow.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
Sit wherever you like.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
--[UZAKI] Thanks!
--[ASAI] Um. Who's that?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
You mean Uzaki?

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
Oh, she goes to school with us.
She's a sophomore.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Ah. She's in college?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Almost forgot! I brought
that game you lent me.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Cool. Did ya like?

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] They must be close if
they borrow each other's stuff.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'll admit, that final
act was a real shocker!

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
Here I thought it was an
entirely different game,

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
but when I found out it was kind
of a sequel to the last one,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
it was like goosebump city!

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. For sure, right?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
I mean, I would've been happy
playing just a plain old

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
building game, but it turned out
to be such a crazy-good find,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
I just had to get it out there,
you know what I mean?

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
Since when is he such
good friends with a girl?

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
No! They can't be!

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Oh, those two?

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER chuckles]

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Dad. What's with the chuckle?

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
It's nothing, pumpkin.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
Bring her some water, would you?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Here you are.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it!

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
I guess we go to
the same school.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
My name is Ami Asai.
I'm a senior.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
It's good to meet you!

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
How cool that you're
the senior here!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Be right back.
I'm gonna go put this in my bag.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Hm.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
Hana Uzaki.
I'm a sophomore!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Now that I get a good
look at her, she's really cute!

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Look at her and that
endearing smile.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
And she's short,
so she's got this

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
"adorable baby animal" vibe.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
But she's definitely not a baby.
I mean, wowzer! What the...?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
This girl's a beast!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
Okay, c'mon. Get it together!

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
Ahem. You and Sakurai seem
like you get along great!

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, I guess we do!

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
How long have you
known each other?

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] We were in the
same club in high school.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The water on
Uzaki's table's getting low.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
Guess I should get it.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
He's always been
a big gloomy-face

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
with an evil twinkle in his eye.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
He was a hard person
to get to know.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Even now, in college,
he's gotten no better.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
I mean, he still skulks
around like a loner.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
So, I do my best
to look out for him!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Ah! So, that's how it is.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Well, just call me over whenever
you're ready to order, Hana.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
'Kay!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
She's just so good!

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
I know you want to stick
your nose in their business,

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
but I feel like we really
shouldn't interfere, y'know?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
 It's just hard not to want
to guide them along a bit.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
Don't you love the
service industry?

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.010 position:50% align:center
You get to be a fly on
the wall and watch people

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
live their lives--
like those two.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
It's one of the thrills
of this business.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh. Uh?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Here's your water, Uzaki--

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI groans]
Man, that's cold!

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Sakurai, where the
heck did you come from?

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
That's my line, you ass!

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
Customers are supposed
to sit there, patiently.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
I was bringing the
water to the table!

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, don't gimme that crap!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
You haven't been treating me
like a real customer, anyway!

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Just shut up!

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] Wow, they put on
quite a show, don't they?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
You're telling me.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
I've got to start
taking more shifts!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Oh, maybe give them a towel.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sneezes]

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
What?!

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
So, he didn't come
in to work at all

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
'cause he's down with a cold?

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
Yep, Sakurai gave me a call
first thing this morning.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
Told him to take the day off.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
Prob'ly the result of the
ice-water drenching, yesterday,

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
and the fact that it
got so cold last night.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
So much for the whole,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
"Oh, yeah, I work out,"
tough-guy thing he does.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
Surprisingly fragile, that one.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, yeah, I train.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
[ASAI, CAFE OWNER]
I don't get it.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't she
have a cold, then?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
In that case, sir,
check, please!

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Man, I have
been knocked flat.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
Did colds always hit this hard?

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
I mean, do I need medicine?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess I should try
to eat something first.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
--[grunts] I can't seem to move.
--[doorbell rings]

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
Ugh, what now?

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
[ringing continues]

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Damn, what a racket.
Who the heck is here?

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
They're lucky I've even managed
to get myself outta bed.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
Hey, sicko! A little bird
told me you have a cold!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
I'm here to pay you a visit!

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uzaki.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
What? How do you
know where I live?

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
U-Uh...

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Hey, you okay, there?

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
A-Are you asleep?

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
Wowee. That's a bad cold.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well, looks like
I've let her into my place,

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
after all.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
Who was it?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Who told you where I live?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
Oh. Was that wrong?

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI sighs] Since I finally
found out where he lived,

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe we could
do some gaming or whatever.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
Dude, talk about a let-down.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
This thing has really
wiped him out.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
He brags about stamina,
but a cold kicks his butt.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
Mm! Figures.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
That does it.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, have you seen a doctor?

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
No. I can't move.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
Any meds?

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
No. Haven't been
able to buy any.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
Then you haven't eaten, either.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
Well, all right, then.
Don't worry. Leave this to me!

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Uh...

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oof.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] This one's probably
best for his symptoms.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
A cold calls for leeks!

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI pants]

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hey, can you sit up?

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
Good, then try to eat.
Even if it's just a few bites.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] It was a real adventure,
let me tell you!

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
Empty fridge, awkward kitchen,
dirty cookers.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
So, now... open up!

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I, uh. I can feed myself.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
Would you stop?

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gasps]

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
Well, honestly, I'm not tasting
things very well right now.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
But it's probably good.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
"Probably," huh?
That's just great.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.534 position:50% align:center
See? My cooking
is totally edible.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Thanks.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
Wow, eating really
warmed me up.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] You got a good
sweat going on! Excellent!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
Now, strip!

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No way.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Oh, yes way!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.261 position:50% align:center
Wipe yourself down
and change clothes!

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
You're stinking up the place!

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It's fine! I'm just
gonna take my meds and sleep!

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] Hey, now! Don't you
even try to fight me, sickie!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
--[UZAKI giggles]
--[SAKURAI shout]

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
You've got really nice skin,
my little patient.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll be gentle!

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
No weird roleplay!

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
Too late to be shy now!

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
You must be used to going around
half-naked from swimming.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Look, I can do the front myself!

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI gigles]

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[giggling continues]

00:11:56.675 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
Who knew being taken care of
could actually be so tiring?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
'Kay, here's your medicine.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
If you take this, you should
be all better in the morning.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] But if you're still
feeling awful tomorrow, 

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
make sure you go see a doctor.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Got it.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
Is that really the time?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
You should go on home.
I'll be fine from here on out.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
Yep, as soon as
you're asleep, I will.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
I'll put the key in your door's
mail slot on my way out,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
so you can rest easy.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
Wow. You'd really do that?

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.294 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Yeah, no sweat.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI] I'll just play one of
your games in the meantime.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] You're nuts.
But, I do have to admit;

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
You were a huge help today.
So, thanks.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop, come on.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
That's just the way we are
with each other, ya know?

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hm.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Sakurai, wake up!

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
I can't figure out how to beat
this bald scissors dude!

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
His shields explode when I hit
'em with my blade and it sucks!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
I'll lend you the game and the
console if you'll just go!

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI growls]
I can't go home a loser!

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Will you please let me sleep?!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Sakurai, wait up!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hey, Ami.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling better now?

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks, I am.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that. I know
you had to cover my shift.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's fine. I was
free yesterday, no biggie.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks, anyway.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Hey, why don't I take one
of your shifts soon?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
I have to thank you somehow.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
In that case,
Hana should come by!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
Huh? I guess I'll ask?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] And now, a toast to
Sakurai's swift recovery!

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
To health!

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI, CAFÉ OWNER]
To health!

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Barbecue to celebrate
my recovery? That's a lot.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
All right, it's all-you-can-eat,

00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
and I'm a grilling fiend,
so you'd better eat up, loner!

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI giggles]

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
Here's some chuck and
some tripe and some skirt

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
and some salted tongue!

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
Hey, slow down, that's too much!

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Short ribs! Knuckle! Ribeye!

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
I'll eat what I want!

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI laughs]

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.523 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
I'm getting some vibes here.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
She does seem genuinely happy

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
to see Sakurai feeling
so much better.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Mm!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Look at you two
knockin 'em back!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
I mean, are beer and
liquor really that tasty?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Especially when
paired with good eats.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
The right flavors can change
the entire palette of a meal.

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
Now that that's settled, it's
time for you to eat up, mister!

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
Will you stop?

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI sighs]
I'mma hit the restroom.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.723 position:50% align:center
I really am glad you're
feeling better, Sakurai.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'm sorry
I had to miss work.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
Felt kinda bad about that.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Well, don't.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
I'm just happy Hana was able to
take such, good care of you.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
Okay. So, it was you who told
her where I lived, huh?

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
And...? How'd it go?

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
How'd what go?

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
[ASAI, CAFÉ OWNER]
Hm?

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Stop. Pressuring me while piling
on the finest cuts of meat

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
is totally unfair!

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
And just so you know, it's not
like that with me and Uzaki.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty into my quiet,
solo lifestyle.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
So, I don't want anyone
over if I can help it.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] And Uzaki is basically
the polar opposite of quiet.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
So gloomy!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
Way gloomy!

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
Sakurai. That's just sad.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
No, it's really not!

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] These two have
had a lot to drink.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
Besides. Uzaki may be a
trusted friend and all,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
but she's still a girl.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
If rumors start flying about
her coming to my place

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
all the time, it'll only make
unnecessary trouble for her.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
I live very close to campus,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
so someone could
easily see her there.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
This is so complicated!

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
I had an inkling, but this?

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
This is a lot. What a pain!

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] I was already
fully aware, but still. Still!

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
Dad.

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Right.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
This'll only get juicier
if we just let it be.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
It's like coffee, Ami.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
Slowly roasted,
painstakingly brewed.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
Let's just be patient
and watch it unfold.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center

that rich, deep flavor.

[ASAI, CAFÉ OWNER chuckle]

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
Heyo! Whatcha been
talkin' about?

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh? Oh, uh--

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER] We were chatting
about some work stuff

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
--for tomorrow.
--[ASAI] That's right.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.039 position:50% align:center
Ah, gotcha!

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
[ASAI] We'll be getting
in a shipment of beans

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
and some other heavy boxes.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
Think you could come in
a little early, Sakurai?

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah! Sure thing, Ami.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Thanks!

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
It'll be helpful to have another
set of strong arms around.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Wait, what was
going on just now?

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
I mean between you and your dad?

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[ASAI]
Uh, we really love those beans!

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
Sure, okay.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
Hey, is something wrong?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
It's just... I see you call
Ami by her first name.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
Mm?

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.900 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
If I used her last name, she'd
get mixed up with her dad.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Hmm. If you say so.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
Hey, I spent a long
time grilling that.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
What gives?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]
Wait are you mad at me?

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
Mmm! Drama with a side of rice!

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
[school bell chimes]

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Why the hell would
Uzaki want to meet me here?

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
Seems so random.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
She did start acting weird
in the middle of that dinner,

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
though, that's for sure.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Wonder why. Did I do
something to piss her off?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center

Sakurai.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Eh?

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
Just keep your eye on
this five-yen coin.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
You are getting very sleepy.
So sleepy.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hypnosis? Seriously?
Now what's she trying to pull?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
You will do exactly as I say.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
Do as I say.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I don't know what
she's after with this, 

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
but she did take
care of me before.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll play along.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
Wow, I sure am
feeling super sleepy.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
All right! I guess it's true.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
Simple people really are the
easiest ones to hypnotize!

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Who're you
calling "simple," dammit?

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
[UZAKI]
Okay, let's do this!

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Here we go.
I hope it's nothing too crazy.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
You will call me
by my first name!

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh? That's it?

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
That's what she
hypnotized me for?

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap. She's waiting for it.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
I guess I have to.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.927 position:50% align:center
Ha... Ha... Ha...

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
Ha?

[SAKURAI grunts]
This is a little embarrassing.

Ha... Hano.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Nope. That's not it.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
Hanu.

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center

Yea, I'm totally fascinated!

I mean.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center

And I get, "Hey, you."

don't you think?

I'm sorry. For real.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
But, uh. I've always
been uncomfortable.

first names.

her that for work,

It worked?! Are you
kidding me right now?

You must have zero
resistance or something!

in here somewhere!

Look, what are you
talking about?

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
I already told you,
I wasn't hypnotized!

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:13.852 position:50% align:center
It's frightening that
you can't remember.

00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.687 position:50% align:center
I was never hypnotized.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.857 position:50% align:center
Trust me, it would be a big deal
for me if I actually was!

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.067 position:50% align:center

sound ticked off?

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:23.194 position:50% align:center

Yep.

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.491 position:50% align:center
They say it's impossible
to hypnotize someone

unless they trust
you completely.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.538 position:50% align:center
Which means these two...
