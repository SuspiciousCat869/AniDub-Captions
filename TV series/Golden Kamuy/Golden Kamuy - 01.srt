[GOTOU] Hey, c'mon, pal.
I'm talkin' to you here.

17
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,250
Saichi Sugimoto,
can you hear me?

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,791
You just got back from the
war with Russia, right?

19
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,083
So why the hell are you here?

20
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,583
I heard you were so tough

21
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,541
they called you the
Immortal Sugimoto.

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,000
Never woulda guessed an
easygoing guy like you

23
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,958
was such a monster. They say you
clawed your way up from the pits

24
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,125
of hell, leaving a mountain
of corpses in your wake.

25
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,125
Bayonets, machine guns, even
cannonballs couldn't kill you.

26
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,041
So, let's hear it.
That true or what?

27
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,666
I'm just sayin' it's fishy.

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,375
If you did all that stuff,
they'd give you a medal or

29
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:13,416
a pension or some crap, but here
ya are lookin' for gold.

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,166
[SUGIMOTO] Yeah, well, I got
pissed off and beat the crap

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,666
out of a superior officer,

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,541
so they weren't feeling
too charitable.

33
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:24,166
[laughs]
Well, that's a shame!

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,833
Y'know. I got an
interesting story, too.

35
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,416
It's about gold, so it'll
probably tickle your fancy.

36
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,583
Now you keep this
one between us.

37
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:45,041
I'm only lettin' you in on the
secret 'cause I like ya, kiddo.

38
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,250
Back in the day, you could
find gold all over Hokkaido.

39
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,583
Their riverbanks had
pieces as big as soybeans.

40
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,583
People were comin' back with
30 <i>monme</i> worth of the stuff,

41
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:59,333
day after day. That's what I
call a "gold rush," my friend.

42
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,916
Around that time, some Ainu were
storing up tons of this gold

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,791
to fight the Japanese,
who were still oppressing

44
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,208
them even after the
Meiji restoration,

45
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,166
forbidding them from
hunting and fishing,

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,333
and stealing their land.

47
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,375
[GOTOU] Ha,ha. Hell, 'least
they were rich, right?

48
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,333
And then one man stole it all.

49
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:23,291
Killed every last Ainu
guardin' it, the maniac.

50
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,291
Twenty <i>kan</i> in solid gold!
That's enough to buy

51
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,458
every brothel in Otaru,
with plenty to spare!

52
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,333
Anyway, the police
caught wind of the story,

53
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,416
and the killer had to
hide the gold in Hokkaido.

54
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,041
And then he got caught
before he could tell anyone

55
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,791
where he stashed
his treasure.

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,208
They threw him into
Abashiri Prison,

57
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,541
at the ends of the earth,
sentenced to death.

58
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,125
He wanted to tell his
comrades on the outside

59
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,166
where the gold was, but he
never wrote a letter.

60
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,250
The guards would probably
just steal it you see.

61
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,291
He knew everyone was
looking for this gold.

62
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,958
Those guards tried
every trick in the book,

63
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,291
but they couldn't get
a word outta the man.

64
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,500
In the end, one of the
guards turned out to be

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,500
a real sick bastard.
Just to make sure the man

66
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,041
wouldn't escape, he cut
a tendon in his leg!

67
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,541
What would you do, if that
hidden gold was yours?

68
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,125
If you were locked up in most
heavily-guarded prison

69
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,125
in Japan, how would you get a
message out with all those

70
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,833
guards breathin' down your neck?

71
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,833
What'd he do? Just tell me.

72
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,750
He hid the message on
a body... Or bodies.

73
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,416
He tattooed the flesh of
cellmates with a code

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,125
that revealed the location
of the treasure.

75
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,541
He mixed coal with saliva.

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,083
And with a makeshift needle,
he formed a map across their

77
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52,250
skin that only his friends on
the outside could understand.

78
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,333
When it was over, he had
only one thing to say.

79
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,250
"I've given you the answer,
now break out of this prison

80
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,458
and half the gold is yours."

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,958
[SUGIMOTO]
That doesn't make sense.

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,000
Just send a coded
letter with them.

83
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,833
Tattoos are too conspicuous.

84
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,750
[GOTOU]
That's what you think.

85
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,083
It wasn't until later they
understood the truth

86
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,750
behind the tattoos.

87
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,666
They're all unique,
so you can't crack the code

88
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,208
unless you had all
of 'em together.

89
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,666
Some disreputable
soldiers heard the rumors

90
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,250
about the tattoos and
had the prison hand over

91
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,291
the inmates, sayin' they
needed a transfer.

92
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,208
The military wanted
that gold, too.

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,000
But that was the prisoners
chance to escape.

94
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,833
They knew someone
would get greedy,

95
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,666
and take all of them
out of the prison,

96
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,208
thinkin' that they could
figure out the code.

97
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,291
As you might guess, the
criminals killed all the guards,

98
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,958
and disappeared into the woods.

99
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,083
Then what?

100
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,458
I dunno.

101
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,708
So nobody found the
prisoners or the gold?

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,833
[GOTOU] Nope. That's the end of
the story. Pretty crazy, huh?

103
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:05,875
All a' that gold, just out
there waiting. Real pity.

104
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,958
[SUGIMOTO] You seem to know
an awful lot about this.

105
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,750

106
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,791
[SUGIMOTO]
Another one of your tall tales.

107
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,666
Like that Ezo wolf you said
you saw. They all died out.

[TORAJI]
Saichi, you should come with me.

113
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,708
There's still plenty of gold
to be found in Hokkaido.

114
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,708
You don't have anything
tying you down, right?

115
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,291
I need to try and make
money for my family.

116
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,833
Umeko. She loses more of
her eyesight every day.

117
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,666
There's no time.

118
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,333
It makes me sad to think about
her not being able to see

119
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,166
her child grow up.

120
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,541
I have to try, Saichi.

121
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,041
Yeah, I know.

122
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,000
They say America has the best
eye doctors in the world.

123
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,416
I did the math.

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
The ship passage and
the operation would cost

125
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,291
about 200 yen.

126
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:18,166
That's a lot, but one lucky day
of panning for gold and I'm set.

127
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,208
Once this war's over,
our relations with America

128
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,333
are probably going to
get worse. There's no time.

Saichi, please take
care of Umeko.

130

Nobody will want to marry a
woman with failing vision.

Not with a child, too.

You're my best friend.
I'm begging you.

[SUGIMOTO] What happened?

A brown bear.

159
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,666
It took one bite and
buried the rest for later.

160
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,708
His neck was broken.

161
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,458
The thing killed him before
he could even scream.

Wait. What the...?

Is that what I
think it is? No way.

165
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,083
[SUGIMOTO] A tattoo. You were
one of the prisoners all along.

166

That about settles it, then.

No wonder that old drunk
knew so much about the gold.

So, this is the

I can't leave him out here.

When that bear comes back,
it'll eat him for dinner.

The poison I used is made
from red stingray spine and

185
00:11:55,041 --> 00:12:00,041
wolfsbane root, so it acts fast,
but the bear can still lash out.

That girl... She's an Ainu.

[SUGIMOTO]
Is it dead?

[ASIRPA] Its hairs aren't
standing on end anymore, so yes.

What're you doing?

190
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,791
Cutting out the part where
the poison arrow hit.

191
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:25,625
Otherwise, the poison will
spoil the meat and the fur.

192
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,291
He was killed?

193
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,625
Uh, yeah. He was gutted
and buried in the snow.

194
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,625
The mother bear ate his insides.

195
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,083
Mother bear?

196
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,791
There was a cub in a tree
and she burst out of a hole

197
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,041
over there to protect it.

198
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,250
That's not right.

[SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

200
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,916
[ASIRPA] When a bear first
comes out of hibernation,

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,958
its stomach is shrunken,
so it can't eat yet.

202
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,791
Even if it did attack a
human to protect its cub,

203
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,375
it couldn't eat them.
Look. The stomach is empty.

204
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,250
So, you're saying he was
attacked by a different bear?

205
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,500
It's a " <i>matakarip</i> ".

206
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,708
It means "those who
wander in the winter".

207
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:05,333
If it ate meat,
then it has to be one.

208
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,791
They're bears who
missed hibernation.

209
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,666
Very aggressive.

210
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,083
What are you going to
do with that man's body?

211
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,958
[SUGIMOTO] I'm not sure.
Take him to a town?

212
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,208
[ASIRPA] Bad idea. A <i>matakarip</i>
won't give up so easily,

213
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,208
not after it's had
a taste of meat.

214
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,500
Wherever you take its dinner,
it's sure to follow you.

215
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,583
You don't want to lead a wild
bear into a town, do you?

216
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,125
Forget him.

217

Not a chance!

[ASIRPA] Hm? I didn't realize
he meant so much to you.

219
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,208
Is he a family member of yours?

It's complicated, okay?

Fine, if you think you
can kill that bear.

You are a soldier I guess.

[SUGIMOTO]
Yeah, but I fought Russians,

224

not monster bears.

but it all checks out so far.

That means I can't let

I get it. You think I'm nuts.

I didn't believe the
story at first, either.

239
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,750
I'll do it.

240
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,208
You will?

241
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,291
My father. He was one of
the Ainu who was killed.

242
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,166
The story must be true.

243
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,666
And you're sure?

244
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,583
[ASIRPA] We can talk more later.
For now, gather firewood.

245
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,583
[SUGIMOTO]
Are the bears afraid of fire?

246
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,250
[ASIRPA] No. We're not
trying to keep it away.

247
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,833
This is to give us light
so we can shoot it.

248
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,458
We'll set up an ambush using
the corpse here as bait.

249
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,041
[SUGIMOTO] If that's the plan,
then I should bring this guy

250
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,000
a little closer to
the fire, right?

251
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
[ASIRPA]
How cruel.

252
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,250
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

253
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,916
His tattoo. I get it now.

00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,791
[ASIRPA]
Look closer.

256
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,458
The killer never intended
to split the gold with them.

257
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,708
They had no clue.

258
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,625
The tattoos stretch
around his chest and arms,

259
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,000
but they stop at the
median lines of his body.

260
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,833
The meaning's clear
to any hunter.

261
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,250
This is how you would mark an
animal you were going to skin.

262
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,541
You're saying, the only reason
they were tattooed was so that

263
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,625
they could be skinned later?

264
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,083
[SUGIMOTO]
This is insane.

265
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,958
What kind of man would come
up with a plan like this?

266
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,625
He'll do anything to
protect that gold.

267
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,916
[SUGIMOTO]
If that's how it works,

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,875
can't we just skin him
before the bear comes?

269
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,291
[ASIRPA]
No time.

270
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,958
Brown bears don't wander
far from their prey.

271
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,166
[SUGIMOTO]
All right.

272
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,833
Guess we're hunting
a monster bear, then.

273
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,916
Once a brown bear
kills a human,

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,291
it can never eat
anything else again.

275
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,083
No longer fearing us, the bear
becomes an evil god.

how weak we really are,

278
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,208
it's no surprise
they lose their fear.

279
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,250
Its curse will draw it here.

280
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,250
Be ready, and keep
the fire bright.

281
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,000
We're helpless without its
light until the sun rises.

Find what now?

284
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,666
[ASIRPA]
White birch bark.

285
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,666
It's oily and it burns
for a long time,

286
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,541
so we can use little
pieces of it like a torch.

I know roughly where it is.

297
