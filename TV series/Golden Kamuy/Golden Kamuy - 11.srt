Yeah! Okay, maybe he didn't,

158
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,791
but I bet that he would
if he was still alive!

159
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,416
[ASIRPA]
Hm?

160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,833
[grunts]

161
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,958
Everybody help me!

162
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,041
Stop, it's not
gonna come off.

163
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,208
I'm not Kobutori Jiisan,
you know.

164
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,041
Asirpa, don't do that
to his forehead!

165
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,625
Hey, little miss,
lemme give you some advice.

166
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:44,333
What's important in life...
are dicks.

167
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:49,708
I don't know. I saw a dick at
a beach once. It was kinda...

168
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,166
[chuckles]

169
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
Well, men shrink when
it gets cold, you know.

170
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,125
It gets bigger and smaller,
did you know that?

171
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,625
I'm not talking
about size, here!

172
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,875
I'm saying that what a woman
really needs to find out,

173
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,041
is if it's the dick
of a gentleman.

174
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,458
That's right!

175
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,666
[USHIYAMA] Hm. Now, let's go.
Dick lecture is over.

176
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,041
The proprietress is
waiting in my room.

177
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,583
[ALL]
Thanks for dinner, sensei!

178
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,958
[USHIYAMA] Hm? Was there a
hole in that wall before?

179
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,458
Secret corridor, huh?

180
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,791
[USHIYAMA]
What is this thing?

181
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:54,208
[USHIYAMA]
Hm... My sweet, where are you?

182
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,500
[SHIRAISHI grunts]

183
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,958
Okay. I'm almost there.

184
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,875
[gasps] Ushiyama! What the
hell are you doing here?

185
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,041
[USHIYAMA]
Huh?

186
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,833
It doesn't matter,
come on, help me out!

187
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,375
The proprietress is someone
we knew from before!

188
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,375
[USHIYAMA]
What did you say?

189
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,750
[SHIRAISHI]
I finally remembered!

190
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,208
She was one of the prisoners!

191
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,541
[USHIYAMA]
Proprietress?

192
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:26,875
[USHIYAMA mumbles]
Hey... Proprietress. Hehe.

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,833
[vomits]

194
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,666
[SHIRAISHI] Think back.
You have to remember!

195
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,583
[SHIRAISHI] All the make-up
kept me from recognizing her.

196
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,625
But that mole by her lip.

197
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,375
Remember the old man
that was a doctor?

198
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,375
The proprietress is one
of the tattooed prisoners.

199
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,250
But wearing women's clothing!

200
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,750
Huh?

201
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,916
[USHIYAMA grunts]
It doesn't matter!

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,083
[SHIRAISHI yelps]

203
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,958
[snorts] I'm not leaving
until I screw her!

204
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,250
[USHIYAMA yells]

205
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,208
[SHIRAISHI grunts] You know
that won't work, right?

206
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,333
Come on, we can leave from here!

207
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,333
[USHIYAMA] Proprietress!
Proprietress! Proprietress!

208
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,041
Proprietress! Proprietress!

209
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,333
Oh good. His lust has driven
him mad. That's great.

210
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,583
[USHIYAMA]
Proprietress! Proprietress!

211
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,291
From the first
moment I saw her,

212
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,166
I thought she was
truly beautiful.

213
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,541
Such smooth skin.
Such lush hair.

214
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,583
And, these eyes.

215
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:51,750
[IENAGA] Deep, deep blue.
With just a hint of green.

216
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,583
I want them.

217
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,333
[SUGIMOTO grunts]

218
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:05,250
Tell me, why were you just
licking Asirpa's eyeballs!

219
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,791
[IENAGA]
Damn it.

220
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,750
I shouldn't have weakened the
gas to keep that kid alive!

221
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,708
Oh no! You've got it
completely wrong!

222
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,166
When she got back,
she seemed ill.

223
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,791
My only thought
was for her health.

224
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,791
I promise, I just came
in to check on her.

225
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,208
Listen, eye-licking monster.

226
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,416
How in the hell did
you get in here?

227
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,958
[gasps]

228
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,916
[SUGIMOTO]
I had the door blocked.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,916
So, tell me how you did it!

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,791
[SHIRAISHI grunts] Sugimoto!
Let me in! This hotel's insane!

231
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,291
There's bodies in an
underground torture room!

232
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,125
The proprietress is
a tattooed prisoner!

233
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,833
Remember what I told you?

234
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,541
About the prisoner who was
a doctor and would kidnap

235
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,958
his patients and do
crazy things to them?

236
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,375
This is the same person?

237
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,250
The old guy who believed the
crap about eating animal parts

238
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,125
and killed tons of people?

239
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,833
You were really going to eat
Asirpa's beautiful eyes?

240
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,416
[IENAGA]
Youth, strength, beauty.

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,458
The longing for a
fulfilling life.

242
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,000
The fact of the matter is,

243
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,833
people are greedy creatures
who want what they can't have.

244
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:19,041
That's the human condition,
and you know I'm right.

245
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,750
Nobody's going to buy
any of this crap.

246
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,083
You don't buy it, yourself.

247
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,583
[IENAGA grunts]

248
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,958
However, the part about humans
being greedy is very true.

249
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,916
For instance. I'm fully planning
to rip those tattoos off of you

250
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,458
without a thought.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,125
[gasps]

252
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,708

253
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,916
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh? Where did...?

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,041
[SUGIMOTO]
Shiraishi! She ran!

255
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,583
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

256
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,333
[IENAGA] Everything's been
ruined since those

257
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,500
bastards came here!

258
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,541
[USHIYAMA]
Proprietress!

259
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:08,416
Proprietress! Proprietress!
Proprietress! Proprietress!

260
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
[IENAGA] It's the man who's
obsessed with his dick!

261
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,125
[snores]

262
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,500
[SHIRAISHI]
Kiroranke, wake up!

263
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,708
We're getting the hell
out of this murder hotel!

264
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,875
She's here!

265
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,541
[KIRORANKE grunts]

00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,291
[gasps]

267
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,375
Stay away you mad doctor!

268
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,166
That was a grenade.

269
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,333
[IENAGA coughs]

270
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
[gasps]

271
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,291
[IENAGA] Listen to me!
This is the guy you want!

272
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,625
He's a tattooed prisoner, too!
Ushiyama the Undefeated!

[grunting]

275
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,875
This hotel is
useless to me, now.

276
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
[IENAGA]
It's time to end it!

277
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,333
[SUGIMOTO] Get the hell
off of me, you asshole!

[grunting]

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,041
[USHIYAMA] Shit. It was
just getting good, too.

280
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,416
[IENAGA]
I've got to get out of here.

281
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,958
[IENAGA]
Shiraishi!

282
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that alcohol?

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,125
[SUGIMOTO yells]

[SHIRAISHI gasps, grunts]

285
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,416
Shiraishi, what the hell
are you doing here?

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,291
So, you finally regained
your senses? What about you?

287
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,125
We were supposed
to meet tomorrow!

288
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,791
Oh, I see. That explains it.

289
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,916
[SHIRAISHI]
Huh?

290
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,333
He's the guy, then.
Immortal Sugimoto.

291
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,000
Of course he is.

294
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,916
[SHIRAISHI] It looks
like a fire's broken out!

295
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,875
We need to focus on
getting out of here alive.

296
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,833
[USHIYAMA]
Wait.

297
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,166
[SHIRAISHI]
Huh?

298
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,375
Just one thing. I have a
message from the old man.

299
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,333
"Keep us informed
of your whereabouts.

300
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,458
And don't assume that you'll
be able to trick me."

[SHIRAISHI]
Hm.

302
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,875
Huh? My bag!

303
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,875
[USHIYAMA]
What bag?

304
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,333
[SHIRAISHI gasps]
There it is!

00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,916

Run!
