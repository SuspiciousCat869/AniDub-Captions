Please, you can't leave me, too!

155
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,000
What am I supposed
to do without you?

[ASIRPA sobs]

157
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,875
[ASIRPA]
Retar, come back!

158
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,000

00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,291
[MAKANAKKURU]
I know she may seem grown up,

160
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:22,416
but the truth is, Asirpa is
a lonely little girl.

161
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,375
After that happened,
she never smiled anymore.

162
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,375
But here lately, she's happier.

163
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,666
I think being in the
mountains with you

164
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,541
has brought her some joy.

165

[HUCI speaks Ainu]

I think I know what
you're saying.

169
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,958
It's beautiful. You love
her so much, don't you?

170
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,250
The whole village does.

171
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,333
[SUGIMOTO]
Farewell.

172
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,916
[ASIRPA]
He left without telling me?

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,083
I will never forgive him.

174
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,750
I won't feel right till I whack
him in the head with a <i>sutu</i> .

175
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,250
[ASIRPA]
There's no sign it was used.

176
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,458
So, he went to town
and didn't come back?

177
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,041
This doesn't feel right.

178
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,916
It'll be really hard to find
him in that huge town, though.

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,125
What do I do? I've got to try.

180
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,958
[whistling]

181
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,458
[ASIRPA] If I keep playing my
deer flute on this deer path,

182
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,083
then maybe he'll think
there's game here

183
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,708
and he'll come to hunt it.

184
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,666
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, big guy.

185
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,625
Huh? Oh, it's you again.

186
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,416
Has anything strange
happened lately?

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,083
[MAN A]
Hm. Yeah, one thing.

188
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,333
A girl who works at a place
a friend of mine owns

189
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,083
was badly hurt by a customer.

190
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,375
That kind of thing
isn't too rare, though.

191
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,916
[MAN A] Well, the customer
had weird tattoos.

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,708
That's what you were looking
for the last time, right?

193
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,000
[SUGIMOTO]
Hm.

194
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,875
[OLD WOMAN] I'll go get the
girl and bring her down.

195
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,583
You wait here. Have a nice,
hot bowl of herring soba.

196
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,500
Our herring soba is
the best in town.

197
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,166
This looks good.

198
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,916
The broth's nice and thick,

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,666
it's just right for a boy
from Kanto like me.

200
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,125
[SUGIMOTO] And the subtle
sweetness of the herring

201
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,333
as it melts in your mouth.
She wasn't kidding.

202
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,250
This is delicious.

So, which man was it?

Who was asking about
the strange tattoos?

207
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,750
It was the one

You should think of me as

At any moment I
should desire it,

that's what he said. I ask
around about the guy,

and suddenly I'm surrounded

gonna run, right?

Which one of you was it
that hit me with the gun?

You should mark up your face,

tell you apart.

My name isn't Sugimoto.

253
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,541
[TSURUMI] I saw Immortal
Sugimoto once at Port Arthur.

254
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:53,375
Even from far away,
I was in awe of his ferocity.

255
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,791
A demon on the battlefield,
merciless and unstoppable.

I know it was you
who I saw that day.

257
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,500
After that display
at the soba house,

258
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,458
there's no doubt in my mind.

259
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,750
Except, I was in the Second.
I wasn't even at Port Arthur.

260
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,791
Looks like you really
do have the wrong guy.

261
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,500
Why would Private Ogata
do something as foolish

262
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,125
as attacking the
Immortal Sugimoto?

263
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,291
The only reason I can think of
is you had one of the tattoos

264
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,958
that show where the
missing gold is hidden.

265
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,625
I believe that's why you
tried to flee from us.

266
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,083
Because you were afraid
we'd figure that out.

267
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,291
You have one of the
tattooed skins, don't ya?

268
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,291
Why don't you tell
me where it is?

269
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
Wait, gold? And tattoos?

270
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,625
Yeah, I dunno what
you're talking about.

271

Hey, buddy, what do you think?

Is your boss alright
in the head?

273
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,083
Actually, a shell blew away
a little chunk of my brain.

No reaction at all.
Not even so much as a blink.

277
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:08,458
That's impressive. I knew it.
You are Immortal Sugimoto.

278
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,208
But if you're immortal and
I can't blow out the candle

279
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,958
of your life the way I
had promised, it'll be

280
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,625
a lot less gratifying, but I'll
just have to chew that

281
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,708
candle from the top down.

282

[ASIRPA] This is one of
Sugimoto's socks.

283
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,291
He left it behind.

00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,583
You stand out, Retar,
so we'll wait for nightfall.

285

[TSURUMI] There's only one way
for you to survive this one,

my friend. Agree to
come and work for me.

287
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,458
I'm afraid I lost many of my
men out on the battlefield.

288
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,166
I need more of 'em now.

289
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,250
I have a little under a hundred
men searching all of Hokkaido.

290
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,875
It isn't even close to enough.

291
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,583
[SUGIMOTO] That sounds like
an awful lot of people

292
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,291
to split the gold with,
if you ask me.

293
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,500
The gold goes into
our war chest.

294
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,125
The weapons and ammo
we stole from Asahikawa

295
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,625
aren't going to last forever.

296
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,625
[SUGIMOTO] What exactly
are you planning to do?

297
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,625
[TSURUMI] We're going to buy
weapons from an American.

298
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,083
The very latest weapons,

299
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,083
gathered from all
over the world.

300
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,833
We'll start by taking
over the Seventh.

301
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,916
After that, we'll assume
control of all the major ports

302
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,416
that control the flow of
goods to the mainland.

303
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,041
Hokkaido will be ours.

304
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,166
We were heroes
on the battlefield,

305
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,416
but when we arrived back home,
we became vagrants.

306
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
Think, did you gain
anything from fighting?

307
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,291
Or did you lose far more?

308

You're not Sugimoto.

Aren't you?
You're the Scat King.

I'm Yoshitake Shiraishi,

Huh? Wait just a minute.

Aren't you that

Don't eat him.

Retar would never
mistake a scent.

325
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,125
Now, where is Sugimoto?

326
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,833
I don't know! He's not
with me! I'm alone!

[ASIRPA] But, that doesn't
make any sense.

328
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,000
We followed the
scent from his sock.

329
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,500
Why would his scent
lead us here to you?

330

[SHIRAISHI]
His sock?

Wait a minute.
That has to be it.

Sugimoto left and
betrayed you, didn't he?

00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
I'm betting he up and
ran off with those skins.

337

Shut up.

Yeah, I see now,

around is about Sugimoto.

[SHIRAISHI] Yesterday, a man

got in a huge

Take me to where he is.

swelling's gone down now.

If it's really him,
we could rip out his guts,
