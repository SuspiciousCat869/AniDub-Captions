00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,833
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

158
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,458
He's been actively recruiting
the other prisoners, too.

159
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,458
If we find him, chances are,
we'll find a lot of tattoos.

160
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,958
Toshizou Hijikata.
What's that guy like, I wonder?

161
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,708
[SHIRAISHI] He was right in
front of you not long ago.

162
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,333
He has a way about him
that makes it impossible

163
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,416
to believe that he's over 70.

164
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,916
In fact, the other prisoners
used to say he must've eaten

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,541
mermaid flesh.

166
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,125
Mermaid?

167
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,458
It's a monster with the torso of
a man and a bottom like a fish.

168
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,291
If a human eats their flesh,

169
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,083
it's said they receive endless
youth and eternal life.

170
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,833
Yeah, there's that old
legend called "Yaobikuni".

171
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,166
A girl who eats mermaid flesh
then becomes forever young.

172
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,416
But she lives so long,

173
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,375
she can only watch as
everyone she loves dies.

174
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,333
She lives for centuries
before finally becoming a nun

175
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,916
and retreating from the
world to live in a cave.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,083
Oh, the pain of not being
able to die when you should.

177
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,625
[sighs]

178
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,708
You know, if I was immortal,
I wouldn't care about the gold.

179
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,291
Hey, look!

180
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,708
Check it out, Sugimoto! It's a
perfect little Adonis flower!

181
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,833
It's so adorable.
Spring's on its way, huh?

182
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,375
[ASIRPA]
<i>Cirai appapo</i> .

183
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,958
We call this bright little
guy the <i>huchen</i> flower.

184
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,250
[SUGIMOTO]
<i>Huchen</i> ? You mean like the fish?

185
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,458
[ASIRPA] Yup. The <i>huchen</i>
appear in the spring.

186
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,625
The blooming of the
<i>cirai appapo</i> is a sign

187
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,291
they're coming up
the river soon.

188
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,625
[SHIRAISHI]
Huh? The river's been damned.

189
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,250
[ASIRPA] It's one of the
ways the Ainu catch fish.

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,833
[SHIRAISHI]
I've heard that <i>huchen</i> are

191
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,875
actually pretty tasty. Think we
could catch some around here?

192
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,583
[ASIRPA]
It's not that easy.

193
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,541
You run the risk of finding an
<i>Iwan Onnechep Kamuy</i> .

194
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,625
What the hell is that?

195
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,291
[ASIRPA] Once, there was a
hunter being chased by a bear

196
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,291
who tried to escape
across Shikaribetsu Lake.

197
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,958
After a while the bear vanished,
so he went to see what happened

198
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,541
and he saw a huge <i>huchen</i>
with the bear's front leg

199
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,916
sticking out of its mouth.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,666
<i>Iwan Onnechep Kamuy</i> ,
greatest of all <i>huchen</i> .

201
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,208
Ah... The greatest, huh?

202
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,458
[SHIRAISHI] It's surprisingly
deep, you guys! Help me!

203
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,958
It's cold!

204
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,041
[SUGIMOTO] What are you doing?
Here, grab on, you idiot!

205
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,958
<i>Iwan Onnechep Kamuy</i> !

206
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,166
That fish ate Shiraishi!

207
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,125
Shiraishi...

208
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,250
[SUGIMOTO]
Shiraishi!

209
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,791
[ASIRPA, SUGIMOTO gasp]

210
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,083
[SUGIMOTO]
Look a mermaid.

211
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,625
[ASIRPA gasps]
Kiroranke Nispa!

212
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,083
That you, Asirpa?

213
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,833
Wait, you know this guy?

214
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,791
Sure I do. He's an old
friend of my father's.

215
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,375
I finally found you,
and it's about time.

216
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,625
[ASIRPA]
Huh?

217
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,458
Look at all this great skin.

218
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,666
You could make a whole
suit of clothes with it!

219
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,333
Wait, fish-skin clothes?

220
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,291
[ASIRPA]
Sure, it's called <i>cepur</i> .

221
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,208
It keeps the wind and rain out.

222
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,541
You can also use it to make
boots or a sheath for a dagger.

223
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,958
Well, that's very
useful information.

224
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,166
Thanks for that.

225
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,000
But also, the skin is
seriously delicious.

226
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,625
Makes it hard to decide whether
we should use it or just eat it.

227
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,041
Ah... It's a real
dilemma every time.

228
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,125
You know my vote.

[ASIRPA, SUGIMOTO giggle]

230
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,000
The skin's so thick, but then
it gets nice and soft

231
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,208
when you cook it!

It's a pretty great day when
you eat a legendary giant fish.

234
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,708

are like boiled octopus.

00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,041
You open wide and suck.

00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,708
It's so big.

Well, I'm with the
Seventh Division.

[ASIRPA, SHIRAISHI gasp]

242
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,833
You work for
Lieutenant Tsurumi?

243
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,041
[KIRORANKE]
Mm?

244
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,208
Wait, Sugimoto.

245
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
Lieutenant Tsurumi?

246
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,750
My platoon was commanded
by a different lieutenant.

247
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,750
And I've had nothing
to do with them.

248
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,875
Not since I left the army.

249
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, I suppose there
were twenty thousand men

250
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,458
in the Seventh. I guess not
everybody works for Tsurumi.

251
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,291
I recognized the name
and the facial wound.

252
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,583
Didn't think I'd be seeing a
hero from the war way out here.

253
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,666
A hero? All I did was not die.

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,916
Tell me, Asirpa,

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,666
why is it you're hanging
around with these men?

256
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,333
He's my partner. But Shiraishi
here is basically useless.

Mm-hm.

Alright, then. If you say
they can both be trusted,

Listen, Asirpa.

There's something important
that I need to tell you.

[ASIRPA gasps]

263
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,916
[KIRORANKE] An old Japanese
man came to my village.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,083
He said he was looking
for a particular woman.

Asuko Kochoube.

Oh, no! But how does he know
that name? My Japanese name!

[HIJIKATA]
Do you mind if I ask her name?

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
I already knew everything
about what happened

272

at the Abashiri Prison.

273
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,875
Nopperabo gave the prisoners a
hint so that they could make

274
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,291
contact with his friends
who were on the outside.

"Asuko Kochoube in Otaru".

276
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,750
Nopperabo was trying to
entrust the gold to Asirpa.

00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,125
[SUGIMOTO]
Hm...

Wait a minute, are you saying?

279
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,041
[KIRORANKE]
Nopperabo. is Asirpa's father.

[grunts]

284
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Okay, tell me, how do you
know Asirpa's Japanese name?

285
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,625
It's because I came to Japan
with Asirpa's father.

286
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:11,041
[HIJIKATA] You see, Nopperabo
isn't an Ainu from Japan.

287
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,291
Judging purely from the
route he ended up taking

288
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,208
after stealing the gold,
he was trying his best

289
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,083
to take it through Otaru, and
eventually, out of the country.

290
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,000
And all this time, I thought,
if we finally found the gold,

291
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,416
Nopperabo would die and
Asirpa would have her revenge.

292
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,041
[ASIRPA] I won't believe it.
Not until I see it for myself.

I'm going to
meet Nopperabo, in person.

294

If all of this is true and
he really is my father,

295
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,000
then I think he should
be willing to tell his

Truth be told,

00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
i'm sure that'll be easier
than finding the prisoners

all around Hokkaido.
