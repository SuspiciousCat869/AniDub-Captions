00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,291
[ASIRPA]
That's right.

157
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,416
This deer died and
now it's warming you.

158
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,541
Its body heat is becoming
yours and keeping you alive.

159
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,375
We and the other animals
will eat the meat.

160
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,833
The rest will feed the trees,
and the grass, and the earth.

161
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,208
The value of the deer's
life still goes on.

162
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,708
[SUGIMOTO]
Should we eat it?

163
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,833
[ASIRPA gasps]
Yes! Let's!

164
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
[SUGIMOTO]
Hm? Retar's acting strange.

165
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,333
[ASIRPA]
Hm?

166
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,875
He's warning us.
Someone's coming.

167
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,291
It must be that soldier.
Why is he still looking for me?

168
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,333
Go ahead. Go.

169
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,666
[ASIRPA] Let's grab what we
can and get out of here.

170
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,208
Retar will come back later
and finish off the rest.

171
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,750
You don't mean this, right?

172
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,166
[ASIRPA] We're eating
the brains. Bring it.

173
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:47,208
[TETSUZOU] Look. Wolf tracks.
And big ones, at that.

174
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,458
Hmm. There's no
sign of it feeding.

175
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:54,333
Did it make the kill and then
some hunters took the meat?

176
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,625
Piss poor job cleaning up.

177
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,083
[TANIGAKI]
A Type 30 rifle and boots,

178
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,333
and a child wearing
deerskin shoes.

179
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,583
Those two from before.

180
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,833
Must be them.

181
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,083
Are you talking
about the Ainu girl?

182
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,666
I don't really know why,

183
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,208
but that wolf doesn't
seem to fear the girl.

184
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,958
However, it sensed us and ran.

185
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,000
Sounds to me like they left
the meat behind for the wolf.

186
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,208
Maybe it'll head back
here to eat it, then.

187
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,833
Tanigaki. I think it's
time for a bath.

188
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,166
[TANIGAKI]
Huh?

189
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,208
Matagi always bathe in
cold water before hunting,

190
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,583
don't they?

191
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,916
We're up against a wolf
with a sharp sense of smell.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,125
We need to do everything
we can to prepare.

193
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,375
[SUGIMOTO]
It's too far away to see much,

194
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,416
but one is carrying
soldier's gear.

195
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,958
At least they don't seem to
be following us. Let's go.

196
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,875
[SUGIMOTO grunts]

197
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,083
[SUGIMOTO]
Someone's here.

198
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,791
It's about time.

199
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,458
[SUGIMOTO]
Oh. It's you.

200
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,041
[SHIRAISHI]
What kinda greeting is that?

201
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:06,291
Oh, you got a fresh kill?
Talk about perfect timing!

202
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,500
I brought some saké to
warm us all up tonight!

203
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,416
[ASIRPA]
Deer lung. You eat this raw.

204
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,375
[SUGIMOTO grunts]

205
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,375
[SHIRAISHI] Why do I have
to chop this, again?

206
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,000
[ASIRPA]
It's <i>chitatap</i> !

207
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,708
[ALL laughing]

208
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,750
Hey, Sugimoto, there's still
some <i>chitatap</i> . Finish it off.

209
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,875
Can't fit another
bite in my belly.

210
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,958
What?

211
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,041
[SHIRAISHI groans]

212
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,333
We will honor the
deer who died today!

213
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,083
The heat of its organs
and taste of its meat!

214
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,375
It's all proof that
the deer lived!

215
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,375
Eat it and remember it all!

216
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,958
That is how we take
responsibility for our prey!

217
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,250
If I were to die,
would you forget me?

218
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,583
Or would you be
the one who didn't?

219
00:14:55,666 --> 00:15:00,875
[ASIRPA]
Huh? Why would you say that?

220
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,583
Don't die, Sugimoto!

221
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,291
I am immortal!

222
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,666
[ASIRPA sobs]

223
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,208
See? He won't die.
Now, open wide.

224
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,875
<i>Chitatap</i> makes
everything better.

225
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,375
<i>Chitatap</i> ' <i>s</i> the best!

226
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,500
[SHIRAISHI]
Oh, right, I almost forgot.

227
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,291
I'm here for a reason.

228
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,208
I wanted to tell you
something I heard in town.

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,041
[SUGIMOTO]
Hm?

230
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,541
Information about one of
those tattooed prisoners

231
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,625
you two've been looking for.

232
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,041
I heard it from
a pelt trader.

233
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,875
A man who'd been arrested for
three murders several years ago

234
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,208
apparently showed
back up in Otaru.

235
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,166
He was a famously
talented hunter,

236
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,708
feared and respected enough
by the pelt traders that they

237
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,916
gave him a second name.

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,625
"The Hunter Who Gives
Hibernating Bears Bad Dreams".

239
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,458
Otherwise known
as Tetsuzou Nihei.

240
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,166
One of those tattoos.

241
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,291
[TETSUZOU] Hey, don't you
look at me like that.

242
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,041
So much judgement. It's only
small because of the cold.

243
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,291
Trust me, it's usually
a monster.

244
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,250
How do you dare joke with me,

245
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,791
after you murdered
those soldiers.

246
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,875
You gonna shoot and
skin me right here?

247
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,708
Then run on back
to the military?

248
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:22,916
Matagi, or soldier? Which one
are you right now, boy?

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,500
That's what you've got
to decide for yourself.

250
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,375
Tetsuzou Nihei. I know where
I've heard that name before.

251
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,958
[SHIRAISHI, SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

252
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,416
[ASIRPA] There used to be this
group of men who'd kill hunters

253
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,125
and steal their prey.

254
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,875
But then, one time it was pretty
clear they picked the wrong

255
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,541
guy to go after.

256
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,000
I'd tracked and slain
a bear that left its den

257
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,333
and was field dressing it.
That's when it happened.

258
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,125
[TETSUZOU]
Can you hear me, thieves?

259
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,583
When I hunt a bear, I'm willing
to risk my life doing it,

260
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,041
you damn cowards!

261
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,708
If you wanna try and hunt me,

262
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,875
you'd better be prepared to
end up a piece of animal shit!

263
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,000
[TETSUZOU]
You're lower than animals.

264
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,958
I won't waste a bullet.

265
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,458
[gasps]

266
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,583
[TETSUZOU] I spent three days
tracking them, one by one.

267
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,666
and beating them to death.

268
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,666
But the last one, the police
that were searching the mountain

269
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,541
got to him first.

270
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,625
Oh, you finally made it, Nihei!
Looks like you're too late.

271
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,625
[OFFICER A]
Hey, put the club down!

272
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,166
Halt! Stop where you are!

273
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,041
Please, you need to
leave him to us, now.

274
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,375
[MAN C laughs]

275
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,875
[TETSUZOU] I'm more obsessed
with tracking my prey

276
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,958
than any bear. Although,
unfortunately, I'm not a bear.

277
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,458
I'm human. And human beings have
their own laws, don't they?

278
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,750
My penalty for following
the law of the mountains

279
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,625
was to be sent to
Abashiri Prison.

280
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,250
I escaped because I wanted
to die in the mountains.

281
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,708
At the end of my journey,
the beasts of the wild will

282
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,333
eat me and shit me out, and I'll
become part of the land.

283
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:13,166
That's my ideal end.
You can understand that, right?

284
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,125
Tanigaki Matagi?

285
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,500
So, he's an older man
and he has an Ainu dog.

286
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,250
The guy from earlier.

287
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,666
Oh, also, there was
one more thing.

288
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
He asked the pelt trader
something interesting.

289
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,166
He said, "If I had
a white wolf pelt,

290
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,875
what would you pay for it?"

291
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,416
[ASIRPA] Why didn't you
tell us that first?!

292
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,708
[ASIRPA] It wasn't me, after
all. They were after Retar.

293
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:45,041
Asirpa, we'll go tomorrow.
We have to get some sleep.

294
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,833
[ASIRPA breathes unevenly]

295
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,541
[SUGIMOTO] This is it. A clue
to the gold's location.

296
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,500
At this point,
he won't be much use,

297
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,625
except to keep you warm.

298
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,000
You'll tell me if the
wolf comes, won't you?

299
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,458
[RYUU growls]

300
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,125
Wolf droppings. He got us.

301
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,625
When could he have?

302
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,500
[TETSUZOU]
If he's smart,

303
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,666
he did it when we were bathing.

304
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,541
[TANIGAKI]
A "watching wolf."

305
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,125
[TETSUZOU]
Hm?

306
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,250
[TANIGAKI] I've heard stories
about wolves that track humans

307
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,458

you're supposed to
take off your clothes,

on those rather than you.

Matagi word: " <i>kibake</i> ,"
