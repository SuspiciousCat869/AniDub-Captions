<i>Ikkakar cironnup</i> , huh?

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
[KIRORANKE] Her fortune-telling
is almost disturbingly accurate,

156
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,500
and the villagers seem to
have gone a little crazy

157
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,375
offering her gifts.

158
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,583
I bet she's visiting a
lot of different villages

159
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,333
and doing the same thing.

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,583
I knew this would happen.
Shiraishi's gone missing.

161
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,000
[SUGIMOTO]
Sheesh.

162
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,583
[KIRORANKE] I found him.
I know where Shiraishi is.

163
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,833
[SUGIMOTO]
Where is he?

164
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,208
[SHIRAISHI]
Okay, we're here.

165
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,125
Do your magic and
make me filthy rich!

166
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,958
Sounds like fun! Count me in.

167
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,666
[SHIRAISHI] Now, first, we need
to choose our horses.

168
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,208
That's your cue,
lovely new friend!

169
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,875
[SHIRAISHI]
How about that one?

170
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,833
[INKARMAT gasps]
Yes. That's the horse you want.

171
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,583
The <i>Sirakki Kamuy</i> says
number four's the one.

172
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,250
Really? You're absolutely sure?

173
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,750
[INKARMAT] I am.
My <i>Sirakki Kamuy</i> never lies.

174
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,291
You know, I've got
just the thing for you.

175
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,791
This is a talisman
called an <i>ekaeka</i> .

176
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,208
If you wrap it
around your wrist,

177
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,708
it will protect you
from disaster.

178
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,833
Well, thank you,
that's wonderful!

179
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:52,833
Twenty sen, please.

180
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,000
Huh?

181
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
[SHIRAISHI]
Okay, I'm counting on you!

182
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,416
Because if I lose here,
I'm flat broke!

183
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,458
Number four.
Number four! Go! Go!

184
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,833
Looking good! There it goes!
Just like that!

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,625
Wow. Whaddya know.
I actually won.

186
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,291
You! You are magic!

187
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,958
Okay. Now help me
with the next race!

188
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,958
[INKARMAT] Of course!
I've got just the thing.

189
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,291
[SHIRAISHI]
Eh?

190
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,000
This is called
an <i>ikema</i> root.

191
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,833
You'll notice that
it smells terrible,

192
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,708
but that's to keep
the evil away.

193
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,833
How much is this one?

194
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,041
Just 70 sen!

195
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,000
And, sold!

196
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,416
[INKARMAT] The next winner
will be number two!

197
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,083
Okay, here we go!
Counting on you!

198
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,291
[SHIRAISHI shouts victoriously]

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,750
There! The red fox
and the scat king.

200
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,250
Hey, Shiraishi!

201
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,000
[SHIRAISHI]
Huh? Oh!

202
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,000
Ha. I thought I
smelled the poor.

203
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,416
And look, it's you guys.

204
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,916
[SUGIMOTO]
You should be ashamed!

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,875
At a racetrack even though
you still owe Asirpa her money.

206
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,375
Pretty damn brave of you.

207
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,500
[SHIRAISHI] Oh, that's right.
Well, let's remedy that.

208
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,416
Two yen? Or three?
Here, pick it up.

209
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,250
What's the-- What're you doing?

210
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,750
Wake up, you fool!

211
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,833
[SHIRAISHI shouts]

212
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,666
If you use fortune-telling
to gamble,

213
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,333
you're going to end
up regretting it.

214
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,791
Don't you let this
fox woman trick you!

215
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,875
[SHIRAISHI] Who are you
calling a fox, rude little girl?

216
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,750
You call her Inkarmat!

217
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,000
Your breath stinks.

218
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,583
The two most likely to win
next are three and four.

219
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,041
Kiroranke you're magic too?

220
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,291
There's no magic about it.
I grew up riding horses.

221
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,000
I know enough about them
that back during the war,

222
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,250
they had me take care of the
combat engineers' animals.

223
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,666
The fox skull confirms that
number three will win,

224
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,791
so you're right.

225
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,041
Woo, number three! Let's go win!

226
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,708
Wait, you idiot!

227
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,958
[KIRORANKE]
Hm...

[BOOKIE A]
Oh, there you are, Takasaki!

229
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,041
Where've you been?

230
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,416
[KIRORANKE]
What?

[BOOKIE B] Hey, that doesn't
look anything like him!

232
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,750
Takasaki doesn't have
a beard like this!

233
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,541
And he isn't an Ainu.

234
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,166
[BOOKIE A]
Uh...

235
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,541
[KIRORANKE]
Is something wrong?

236
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,041
The jockey that cap
belongs to ran off!

237
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,833
Hey, can you ride a horse?

238
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,166
Wait, what?

239
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,500
[BOOKIE B] The horse's owner
told his jockey to cheat,

240
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,000
but the guy took off instead.

241
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,041
[BOOKIE A]
The owner is a yakuza boss.

242
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,583
He's planning to make
an unpopular horse win.

243
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,625
If we fail, they'll make
<i>us</i> pay for it.

244
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,541
We'll give him a lot of
water before the race

245
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,958
to slow him down. It's cheap,
but effective enough.

246
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,250
You can just ride the
way you normally would.

247
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,041
You want to win,
don't you, buddy?

Hey, hold it down!

250
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,416
[KIRORANKE] Hm? What're they
doing over there?

251
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,583
That's the horse that
they've chosen to win.

252
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,333
They mix powdered
viper into the water,

253
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,125
then jam a rubber hose up
its nose and pour it in.

254
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,458
Sometimes they accidentally
put it down the trachea

255
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,375
and end up killing it, though.

[KIRORANKE]
I'll give you the details later.

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,666
I'll be riding number
three in the last race.

And I'm going to win.

<i>Sirakki Kamuy</i> has spoken.

00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,583
It says that number

Shiraishi. I think
that's enough, don't you?

274

Fortune-telling is something
people turn to when they're

not sure what to do.

276

But I have no uncertainty
about this journey.

So, we don't need
fortune-telling.

Sorry, I already did it.

it would actually be better for
