Could this grizzled antiquity
really be the Shinsengumi's

159
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,875
finest swordsman,
Shinpachi Nagakura?

160
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,458
[USHIYAMA] Hey, you old
Shinsengumi geezers.

161
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:00,333
Tell the truth. You're not
just after the gold, are you?

162
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,958
[SHIRAISHI] So, what should
we do with this horse?

163
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,208
That is a good question.
We can't just leave it here.

164
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,791
I mean, would you look
at this guy? He likes me!

165
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,250
No, no, no, we have
to get rid of it.

166
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,083
Stands out like a sore thumb.

167
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,500
And Retar deserves a reward.

168
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,083
[SUGIMOTO groans]

169
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,750
Then it's settled.

170
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,875
[SHIRAISHI] Alright! Horse meat!
Who's up for <i>sakuranabe</i> ?

171
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,333
<i>Sakuranabe</i> ? What's that?

172
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,083
It's just horse meat
prepared like sukiyaki.

173
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,291
Very popular dish in Tokyo.

174
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,041
So, sukiyaki. Is it good?

175
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,541
It's the best!

176
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,291
But we're gonna need an egg
to really make it properly.

177
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,875
I'll go hit up
the local farmers!

178
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,291
Back in a bit!

179
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,208
[SUGIMOTO]
This is awkward.

180
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,500
[SUGIMOTO]
Uh...

181
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,708
I noticed, they really
ripped up your face, huh?

182
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,125
You're probably
covered in wounds.

183
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,416
You should rest.

184
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,458
Asirpa.

185
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,416
This is what it's going to
be like, searching for the gold.

186
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,375
If something were to happen
to you, I don't know how I'd

187
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,916
face your grandmother and
the rest of the village.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,458
What you're saying is that
I'm slowing you down.

189
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,708
No, that's not what I meant.

190
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,541
What's this?

191
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,083
Put it on your face.

192
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,708
I've heard that horse meat can
help reduce swelling, so...

193
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,291
[SUGIMOTO grunts]

194
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,625
[ASIRPA] Sugimoto, I've already
seen my father brutally killed.

195
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,291
I know this is dangerous.

196
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:41,416
But I've chosen to go, and it
was completely my decision.

197
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,666
I made it in order to achieve
my goals and forge my own path.

198
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,875
The one who treated
me like a child,

199
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,916
didn't trust me as
a partner, acted alone,

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,125
made dumb choices,
and was caught.

201
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,541
That was you.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,750
[SHIRAISHI] Look, I got burdock,
cabbage, and the eggs.

203
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,750
Plus, they gave us sugar,
soy sauce, and saké!

204
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,625
Great. Thank you.

205
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,625
[SHIRAISHI]
What's going on here?

206
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,250
Did someone's dog just die?

207
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,833
C'mon, we're about to
have a great meal!

208
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,041
Hey, I'm not lookin' to get
involved in some kinda

209
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,000
couple's quarrel,
so let's eat some stew.

210
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,291
You two can make up later. Eh?

211
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,041
Once the meat's the color of
cherry blossoms, it's ready.

212
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,916
Mix it with the egg, and then...

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,458
[SUGIMOTO]
Ready to eat.

214
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,291
It's great! Seriously, amazing!

215
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,333
So good! The horsemeat
is nice and mild,

216
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,833
so the miso flavor
really comes through.

217
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,750
We're lucky you had
that miso paste!

218
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,583
Wait. Is there <i>osoma</i> in this?

219
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,333
Huh? <i>Osoma</i> ?

220
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,916
[SUGIMOTO groans]
Look, Asirpa, I'm sorry,

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,166
but proper <i>sakuranabe</i>
needs miso!

222
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,375
[ASIRPA groans]

223
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,625
[SHIRAISHI]
Uh-oh, she's not a fan of miso?

224
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,333
[SUGIMOTO] She's convinced
herself it's actually poop.

225
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,333
[SHIRAISHI]
Really? Huh.

226
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,583
The Japanese and the Ainu
sure have culture gaps

227
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,541
in some unexpected places.

228
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,250
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, I'm sorry.

229
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,958
There's plenty of
meat left over.

230
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,833
I'll remake it for you.

231
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,625
[gasps]

232
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,708
[ASIRPA gags]

233
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,708
She's gonna do it!

234
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,500
[ASIRPA groans]

235
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,083
[SUGIMOTO gasps]

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,583
[SUGIMOTO gasps]

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,458
[ASIRPA]
Huh...? <i>Osoma</i> is yummy!

238
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,666
Oh, I'm so proud
I could just cry!

239
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,166
I don't know what
just happened,

240
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,041
but I'm guessing
you liked it.

241
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,416
<i>Hinna</i> , <i>hinna</i> !

242
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,916
<i>Hinna</i> is right!

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,083
[ASIRPA]
More poop, please!

244
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,208
[SHIRAISHI]
Sure, eat up!

245
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,958
[SUGIMOTO]
I'm so happy!

246
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,916
The man we're about to meet,
Zenjirou Shibukawa,

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,291
has his own gang of bandits.

248
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,708
I assume your plan is
to bring him and his men

249
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,291
over to your side.

250
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,416
[HIJIKATA] I sent a messenger,
but he didn't come back.

251
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,583
So you're busting your way in?

252
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,041
There are more of them
than there are of us.

253
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,541
Numbers don't make a difference
to us and they never have.

254
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
The only people who are worth
a damn in this world are

255
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,041
the ones who are willing
to lay down their lives.

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,500
[HIJIKATA] If you want to live,
then prepare to die!

257
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,791
[MEN]
Huh?

258
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,916
[MAN B] Hey! Who the hell said
you could just walk in here?

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
How cute of you to try!

260
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,916
Back off! Up you go!

261
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:45,250
Shibukawa. My messenger...
I trust he spoke with you?

262
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,958
Yeah, I beat the living hell
out of him till he squealed.

263
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:53,708
Told me about the treasure.
It's all very fascinating.

264
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,166
Why don't you show
me your tattoos?

265
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,000
Not yet.

266
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,916
[HIJIKATA]
These are the heads of your men

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,333
who were on guard outside.

268
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,583
So, do we help each
other or kill each other?

269
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,416
I'll leave it to you.

270
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,916
[sighs]
You win, friend.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,375
Kill them, now!

272
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:23,000
[yelling, grunting]

273
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,708
Slaughter them all!
No one's leaving here alive!

274
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,916
[USHIYAMA]
The demon.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,291
Former Vice-Commander
of the Shinsengumi.

276
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,791
[USHIYAMA] The saying goes
that if a man doesn't die

277
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,291
when he should, he faces a
shame even greater than death.

278
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,916
Are you sure you know
what you're doing,

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,666
starting a war at our age?

280
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,333
It's sheer madness,
and you know it.

281
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,833
Hijikata, you wouldn't be
looking for a reason

282
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,125
to die now, would you?

283
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,250
I plan to live for
another century.

284
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291
Don't worry, my friend.

285
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,333
[USHIYAMA]
Old man,

286
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,333
you really planning on making
a new Shinsengumi?

287
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,583
Sorry to disappoint, but I'm
only in this thing for the gold.

288
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,166
You have to know taking over
Hokkaido is nothing more

289
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,708
than a fantasy.

290
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,000
There are many
who long to make

291
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,125
the fantasy of Ezo's
independence a reality.

292
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,500
They've dreamed
of it for generations.

293
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,916
Perhaps now is their time.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,708
Where did the Scat King go?

295
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,833
Shiraishi went into town
to gather up some info.

296
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,791
It's probably best if I stay
away from there for a while.

297
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,541
[ASIRPA] Sugimoto, look!
Ezo deer tracks.

298
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,833
They're still fresh.

299
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,666
Right! You ready to track?

300
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,458
Let's do it.

301
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,041
Are Ezo deer good?

302
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,750
[ASIRPA] The brains are pretty
tasty if you add a little salt.

303
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,958
You're moving way too slow.
We'll never catch this deer.

304
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,666
Just gimme a minute, okay?

305
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,875
I'm so tired.
Man, I need water.

306
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,875
Sad little <i>Sisam</i> .

307
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,541
[ASIRPA] You're in luck,
look what we have here.

308
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,916
Sarunashi vines.
These suck up tons of water.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,625
[ASIRPA] If you cut them,
the sap comes pouring out.

310
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,958
We use these when we run out

Uh... Hey, hey, could I?
Give me some.

Don't drink it all!

How're you so strong?

314
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,791
There are lots of good
uses for sarunashi vines.

315
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,375
Look, they're even sturdy enough
to make snowshoes out of, see?

00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,750
That's much better!

[SUGIMOTO]
What is it?

318
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,875
Look, Sugimoto. A buck
sharpened his antlers here.

319
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,000
He did that to
mark his territory.

320
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,208
If we're noisy and hit
this tree with a stick,

321
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,500
he might come back to defend it.

322

You use that thing
way too much!

323

Huci told me that there used to
be a lot more deer in this area.

324
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,041
They were easy to catch.

[ASIRPA]
Deer aren't treated as gods.

326
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,708
They were called " <i>yuk</i> ,"
which means " <i>prey</i> ,"

327
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,166
because they were easily caught.
It was said that <i>yuk</i> were

328
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,958
scattered across the world by
the gods to be food for humans.

[ASIRPA] But one winter,
the snow fell so heavily

330
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,833
the deer weren't able
to find enough food.

331
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,833
Many of them starved to death.

332
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,833
We believed that someone
must've treated the deer poorly.

333
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,625
And so, it was said that the
gods got angry and stopped

00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,458
sending them for us.

I have to finish it
for its own sake.

This looks like one
dog and two men.

One of the men is big,
with a strange gait.

348

An injured right leg, maybe?

[TETSUZOU] Comparing the brown
bears of Hokkaido to the black

bears Tohoku Matagi hunt is
like comparing wolves to pups.

352

This breed here has been raised
by the Ainu for generations.

It doesn't fear brown bears.

A Murata rifle. Hard to use,
and it only holds one bullet.

That thing's obsolete.
Why arm yourself with a relic?

[TETSUZOU grunts] Yeah, the guns

Hey, where're your
other bullets?

If you have five bullets,
