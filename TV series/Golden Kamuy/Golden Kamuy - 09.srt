[SHIRAISHI, SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

162
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,625
It's like it's
playing with its food!

163
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,916
What's it doing?

164
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,500
Well, if it's not gonna
eat him, let's grab him.

165
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,416
This is the only
chance we're gonna get!

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,666
[HENMI]
No way. Is this happening?

167
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,708
I never would've dared to hope.
A death like this...

168
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,208
[HENMI]
It's the best I could imagine!

169

Come on, heart.
Don't quit on me, now!

Sugimoto! Hurry up, it's coming!

It'll pull us! Grab on!

173
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,833
[TSURUMI]
We can't catch up with him, now.

174
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,208
Very interesting.

175
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,541
Sugimoto's working
with the Ainu?

176
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,000
Whales that come to
hunt the herring,

177
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,583
and orcas that
come to hunt them.

178
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,125
If you want to eat from
the top of the food chain,

179
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,333
I guess you have to
fight as one of them.

180
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,875
Or become one of the
disgusting creatures

181
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,500
that feed on the bodies.

182
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,625
The carcasses that fall
to the great depths.

183
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,125
You certainly have some
fascinating friends,

don't you, Shiraishi?

185
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,791
Particularly the

from the hospital.

And another one, Private First

190
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,833
has apparently been
missing for days.

191
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,166
He's scarier than anybody.
Don't you think?

192
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,833
I won't forget you.
Or how you gleamed.

[TANIGAKI sighs]

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Granny. I'm back.

so much tension, dear.

00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,208
If it isn't Private

[OGATA]
So, it was you, then.

203
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,458
A villager told me there
was an injured soldier,

204
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,458
so I thought I'd wait here.

205
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,833
You seem to be making
yourself comfortable.

206
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,041
There was an <i>amappo</i> ,
an arrow trap.

207
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,916
The poison paralyzed me.
Thankfully, the Ainu saved me.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,125
[OGATA] I see you've
recovered enough to walk.

209
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,166
Is there a reason you didn't go
back to Lieutenant Tsurumi?

210
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,375
Today's the first day, though.
Using a staff.

211
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,000
I planned to stay at least long
enough to repay their kindness.

212
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,458
And today was the
first day, huh?

[TANIGAKI gasps]

Noma and Okada, too.

218
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,708
In fact, none of the others
who were with you came back.

219
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,416
We were tracking some
suspicious hunters.

220
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
I got separated from them.

[HUCI grunts]

What exactly was it that
Corporal Tamai told you?

227
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,416
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

228
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,916
but get away
from her, Nikaido.

If you get rough,
you're gonna regret it.

soldiers in your unit,

231
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,208
didn't you, Tanigaki?

232
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,583

Of course not!

00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,958
[TANIGAKI] This is a
dangerous misunderstanding.

Tell me.

[TANIGAKI grunts]

236
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,291
You can make a jump for it,

237
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,916
but without this,
it won't do you much good.

You really are such a
terrible liar, Tanigaki.

242

If you want to spend some
time repaying your debt here,

243
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,541
that's fine. I'll pretend
I never found you.

Let's go, Nikaidou.

Oh, right, by the way.

Have you seen Immortal Sugimoto?

247

He's apparently working
with an Ainu child

248
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,833
and he's got a few
tattooed skins.

249
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:02,916
This village is close to where
I met him before, so, seen him?

00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,875
No, I haven't.

00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,125

I can't stay here any longer.

00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,250
[KOUHEI]
It seems we missed.

264
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,000
We probably should've just
killed him when we had

265
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,708
the chance, don't you think?

266
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,375
[OGATA] We would've had to
kill the witnesses, too.

267
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,458
I love my grandma.
Don't make me do that.

268
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,666
[OGATA]
Tankigaki's an honest man.

269
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,250
He wouldn't agree to do anything
to betray Lieutenant Tsurumi.

270
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,708
I made that clear
to Corporal Tamai.

271
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,750
[OGATA] Apparently, I didn't
make that clear enough.

272
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,833
My guess is, after they
failed to persuade him,

273
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,416
they tried to shut him up,
but he killed them instead.

274
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Tanigaki must have planned
to wait until he was recovered,

275
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,500
then tell Lieutenant Tsurumi
that we betrayed him.

276
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,125
Just stay down, okay?

277
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,000
I have to fight, but...

278
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:56,458
...how'm I supposed to fight a
master marksman with no gun?

279
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,166
[OGATA] This Type 30 infantry
rifle is a good gun.

280
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,750
But it's difficult for your
average soldier to inflict a

281
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,083
fatal wound from a distance
of more than a hundred meters.

282
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,916
While that's not bad,

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,208
I can blow someone's head
off with perfect accuracy

284
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,083
within 300 meters.

285
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,500
The Seventh had a rough
time with the Russians.

286
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,125
They'd unleash their maxim guns

287
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,500
from the protection
of their bunkers.

288
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,666
If there was a unit of
precision marksmen like me,

289
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,291
many soldiers would
still be alive today.

290
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,458
I'm seeing movement in the
furthest window to the right.

291
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,375
He's using some kind of
claw to close the shades.

292
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,541
[TANIGAKI] From the way
they were talking today,

293
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,125
I think I can guess why
they want me dead.

294
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,041
[TAMAI] You see,
the thing to remember is,

295
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,625
the Seventh Division is just
a collection of strangers

296
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:55,125
from all over Japan. It's more
fragile than you might think.

297
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,541
And not everyone's interested
in Lieutenant Tsurumi's

298
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,458
grand ideals.

299
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,791
Then, are you saying that
there are people who intend

300
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,916
to betray him? Who are they?

301
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,750
Well, if that were to happen,

302
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,791
which side would
you find yourself on?

303
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,666
[TANIGAKI] So, he was talking
about Private Ogata.

304
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,791
I never imagined Corporal Tamai
would betray Tsurumi, too.

305
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,083
At this point, they're not with
the Seventh or anybody else.

306
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,291
They're just my enemies.

307
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,000
[SUGIMOTO] We were lucky
to find a place to sleep.

308
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,000
[SHIRAISHI] And we got
a little sake, to boot!

309
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,250
This is paradise!

310
