They're not. We send
them back to the gods.

It's a traditional ceremony.

Oh, so, in other words...

266
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,666
I had a baby bear.

267
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,500
I took care of him like
I would a little brother.

A year later, just before
the ceremony,

I tried to send him
back to the mountains

missed one before.

So you'll kill him after all.

We don't think of it as killing.

We believe we're returning
them to the gods.

276
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
The Ainu call everything
in our world that helps us,

277
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,833
or that is beyond
our control, " <i>Kamuy</i> ".

278
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,916
Or Gods. We honor these Kamuy
with ceremonies of thanks,

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,208
showing them respect
and devotion.

280
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,208
This maintains a good
relationship with them.

281
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:14,375
My people are hunters, so animal
<i>kamuy</i> are important to us.

282
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,666
In the land of the gods,
animals have human forms.

283
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,416
We believe they come
to play in our world.

284
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,916
Providing us meat and pelts.

285
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:27,666
The most important of all is
the <i>Kimun Kamuy</i> . The bear.

286
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,166
To raise a cub is a great honor.

287
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,916
We lovingly care for
them for a year or two.

288
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,750
When we send the bear back,
the whole village comes together

289
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,875
for a huge ceremony.
This is called " <i>iomante</i> ".

290
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,000
We ask them to tell the other
gods that our world is a fun,

291
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,750
joyful place. It is
said that if we do this,

292
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,083
the <i>kamuy</i> will keep
returning to us.

293
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,708
Okay, but do you really
believe all of this?

294
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,125
[ASIRPA]
You have to understand,

295
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,666
our beliefs make up
our way of life.

296
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,708
For example, I believe that
we raise these bear cubs,

297
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,208
because when they're grown,

298
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,208
they in turn provide us with
much needed pelts and meat.

299
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,875
My people have lived this
way for many generations,

300
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,750
so, yes, I believe that
it's true and right.

301
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,000
There's no way to prevent
the sorrow of parting,

302
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:21,416
I've learned to keep my distance
so I won't get too attached.

303
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
That's a very pragmatic
way of thinking.

304
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,208
You know what I bet, Asirpa?

305
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,041
I bet you're not like most
of the other Ainu are you?

My father gifted me
with the name, "Asirpa".

307
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,458
Its literal meaning
is "a new year".

But it can also mean
"the future".

it's going to be difficult

tracking in this snow.

After all, we know
Tanigaki is a Matagi.

What a surprise to see you.

condition! Four missing!

You're going to pay

Oh, please forgive me.

off the front of my skull

[TSURUMI] I lost a bit of
my frontal lobe, you see.

I'm afraid that it's done
horrible things to my temper.

Beyond that, I'm the

Wounds to the body,
are like a medal.

I feel a nice injury
improves one's looks, see?

Look at this, Ushiyama.

You put oiled paper
against their body

and copy the tattoos
when they show through.
