Yes. It's an Ainu dish.

Here, watch this.

207

First, you skin them.

208
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,375
Once you score the pelt, you can
peel it off like clothing.

Squeeze out the contents of
the organs and wash them clean.

The gall bladder's bitter,
so we remove it.

Usually, you toss the
brain into the <i>chitatap</i> ,

212
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,708
but it's delicious alone.

213
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,250

have the brain.

214

Uh! You mean you
want me to eat it

[ASIRPA]
Squirrels are small,

223
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,541
so we chop the meat
with a <i>tashiro</i> .

224
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,625
A <i>chitatap</i> is chopped
up very finely,

225
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,291
so you can eat
the entire animal,

226
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,208
none of it goes to waste.

227

You're so knowledgeable
about this stuff.

I don't have brothers, so he
took me with him to hunt.

I like the mountains
better than weaving.

Staying home never suited me.
So, it worked well.

It's your turn now.

234
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,791
<i>Chitatap</i> means
"something we carve together".

235
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,125
The "we" is because
we take turns chopping.

You eat it raw, after all.

went into the <i>chitatap</i> , too.

244

flavor of the salty broth.

Hypothermia causes confusion.

find the bullets that
fell into the river!

or not? It's up to you!

[BOTH laugh victoriously]

356
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:42,000
[SHIRAISHI] There are 24
tattooed prisoners, all in all.

357
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,833
How many are actually still
alive is anyone's guess.

358
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,083
As for Nopperabo's friends,
I really have no idea.

359
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,875
The only one who could even
possibly know at this point is

360
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,333
the leader of the prisoners,
who led the escape.

361
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,750
This leader,
tell me about him.

362
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,916
At first, I thought he was
just an old political prisoner.

363
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
A quiet, model captive.

364
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,000
But it turns out, he had us all
fooled from the beginning.

365
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,416
I watched him steal a sword
off one of the soldiers

366

right in front of me.

In less than a second,
three men were dead.

368
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,666
It was later, that I found out
that he was a survivor of the

369
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,291
Hakodate War, 30 years ago.

370

A samurai from
the old shogunate.

371
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,583
But the interesting thing about
that is, I was told that

372
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,166
according to the records, he
actually died during that war.

Nopperabo gave everyone:

"Get yourself to Otaru."

after the tattoos, you know.
