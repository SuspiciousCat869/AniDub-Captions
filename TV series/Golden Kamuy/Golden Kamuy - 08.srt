157
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,875
[SHIRAISHI shouts]

158
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,083
You escape by
dislocating your joints?

159
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,958
[SHIRAISHI] I swear,
I'll skewer your eyeball!

160
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,416
[USHIYAMA grunts]

161
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,125
[SHIRAISHI groans]

162
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,041
No fair using
weapons now, Shiraishi.

163
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,333
[gasps]

164
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,791
[HIJIKATA]
Don't kill him, Ushiyama.

165
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,583
[USHIYAMA]
Hm?

166
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,750
[gasps]

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,541
I'm actually amazed you
found this place, Shiraishi.

168
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,750
Toshizou Hijikata!

169
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,458
[USHIYAMA] I know he looks
like an idiot, but I warn you,

170
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,458
don't underestimate him.

171
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,000
What will you do, Shiraishi?

172
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,666
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

173
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,208
[USHIYAMA] We're willing to
keep you alive, for right now.

174
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,500
Long as you let us
copy your tattoo.

175
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,875
The old man and me
are working together.

176
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,625
Did you seriously plan on
fighting the Seventh Division

177
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,041
all by yourself?

178
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,041
[HIJIKATA] You're not really
working alone, are you?

179
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,041
There's also a man called
the Immortal Sugimoto.

180
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
Immortal Sugimoto?

181
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,000
Now, there's an
interesting nickname.

182
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,500
Is this man your partner?

183
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,583
Well. Actually, it's a bit
more like he works for me.

184
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,333
He's strong, but he's
a super moody guy.

185
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,833
And he doesn't trust us
prisoners one bit.

186
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,250
There's no need for you to
tell him anything about us.

187
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,791
Just make sure that you make
good use of your bodyguard.

188
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,625
[HIJIKATA]
By the way.

189
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
[SHIRAISHI]
Mm?

190
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Do you and this
"Immortal" Sugimoto

191
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,291
have even one of the
tattoos we're looking for?

192
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,666
No, we don't!

193
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,250
[HIJIKATA] Choose right now
whether we fight each other,

194
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,875
or work together.

195
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,750
[SHIRAISHI] The thing is,
I'm a pacifist.

196
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,625
[HIJIKATA] Then maybe
a good place to start,

197
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,875
would be with the skin
of Kazuo Henmi.

198
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,875
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

199
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,208
[SUGIMOTO]
The <i>yanshuu</i> ?

200
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,750
[SHIRAISHI]
Seasonal laborers.

201
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,458
They're hired to
fish for herring.

202
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,458
This time of year, people
migrate in from all over.

203
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,958
Perfect place for an escaped
convict to hide, right?

204
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,458
Lately, though,
some of the <i>yanshuu</i>

205
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:43,250
have been turning up dead.
The killer is a man named Henmi.

206
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,791
How do you know that?

207
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,875
[SHIRAISHI] Because the same
character was found carved

208
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,833
into all the dead
bodies' backs.

209
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,166
Their backs?

210
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,083
I've heard it said
that killing comes

211
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,583
as naturally as
breathing to him.

212
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,541
He looks like a normal man,
but he's just not.

213
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,416
[HENMI] There was a time I
had a brother, but one day...

214
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,666
...he was eaten by a boar on
the mountain near our home.

215
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,166
[HENMI]
All I did was hide and watch

216
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,958
while he cried and screamed.

217
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,708
I just sat there and
watched him suffer.

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,791
When I think about how
he struggled so hard,

219
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,083
how he was killed so
horribly by that monster,

220
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,791
even though he
fought and fought...

221
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,833
A monster he couldn't
bargain with.

222
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,291
When I think of how much
fear and pain he felt.

223
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,166
How the light faded from his
eyes as he gave in to despair.

224
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,708
When I remember those eyes,

225
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,791
It makes me want to kill
anyone and everyone I see.

226
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,958
[SHIRAISHI] His tattoo had the
character for "eye" in it.

227
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,333
[SUGIMOTO]
Makes sense. What a story.

228
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,208
I'm worried that prisoner
might go after my uncle.

229
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,583
Why?

230
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,541
He's on the coast
with the other men.

231
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,958
They're trying to
catch the whales

232
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,875
that are following the herring.

233
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,333
A whale hunt?

234
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:01,083
Sugimoto, let's go.
Off to the coast!

235
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,541
[SUGIMOTO]
Whatever you say.

236
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,125
[SUGIMOTO]
So, this prisoner, Henmi.

237
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,291
You mentioned he had
no interest in the gold.

238
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,291
[SHIRAISHI]
Right.

239
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,958
That doesn't make sense.

240
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,500
He's been so cautious in order
to avoid being arrested.

241
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,208
So, why would he then
leave clues that are

242
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,041
meant to lure out
other prisoners?

243
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,541
I don't even want
to think about

244
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,208
what's going on in Henmi's head.

245
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,875
[SUGIMOTO]
Well, bright side:

246
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,333
if he's that bad a guy,

247
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,208
I won't feel as bad about
stripping off his skin.

248
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,875
[ALL cheer]

249
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,458
[SHIRAISHI] There are some
pretty large herring

250
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,000
fishing zones just
off the coast.

251
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,583
When they bring the
fish back to land,

252
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,208
they process them right there.

253
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,666
I wouldn't be
surprised if Henmi's

254
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,083
trying to blend in
with the workers.

255
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,416
[MAKANAKKURU]
Asirpa!

256
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,208
<i>Achapo</i> !

257
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,583
[MAKANAKKURU] Oh! Great timing!
Hurry, this way! Follow me!

258
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,208
[ALL]
Huh?

259
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,291
[MAKANAKKURU]
Row harder, Sugimoto!

260
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,125
Put your back into it!

261
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,125
Why are we doing this, again?

262
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,958
Another <i>kotan</i> ' <i>s</i> boat found a
whale and hit it with a harpoon,

263
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,875
but the whale's been
dragging them along the coast

264
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,375
ever since yesterday!
Sugimoto, let's help.

265
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,458
[ASIRPA]
That's the boat! We found them!

266
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,750
Look there! A <i>humpe</i> !

267
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,875
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

268
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,291
Try to aim for the neck!
The skin in that area's softer!

269
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,333
[SUGIMOTO] 
Yeah, but where's the neck?

270
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
Yes! I got it!

271
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,166
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

272
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,875
[MAKANAKKURU]
Hang on tight

273
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,208
and don't get knocked
outta the boat!

274
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,416
Even this time of year,

275
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,791
the sea is plenty cold
enough to kill you!

276
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,125
[FISHERMEN chanting]

277
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,541
[SHIRAISHI] Oh, boy! The whale!
It's heading straight for them!

278
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,583
Hey, listen, it's going to
ram you guys! Be careful!

279
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,291
[FISHERMAN A] Hey, I think
that kid might be trying

280
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,625
to tell us something.

281
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,750
[HENMI]
Huh?

282
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,458
[FISHERMEN shout]

283
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,833
[HENMI shouts]

284
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,750
One fell in!

285
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,791
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

286
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,958
[FISHERMAN B]
Grab on! You can do it!

287
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
Let's help!

288
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,541
Quick! That ship's too big to
get back to the coast in time.

289
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,208
He needs to be fireside soon
or he'll die of hypothermia!

290
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,583
Got it! I'll cut the nets!

291
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,416
Shiraishi! It's up to you!

292
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,208
Bring us back
some whale, alright?

293
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
[SHIRAISHI]
Wh-What? H-Hold on!

294
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,625
[SHIRAISHI yells]

295
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,000
[SUGIMOTO]
Hang on!

296
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,291
We've got ya!

297
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,750
[MAKANAKKURU]
Let's hurry!

298
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,041
There should be fires on the
coast to help process the fish

299
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,583
once they're caught!

300
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,708
[HENMI]
Thank you. Thank you.

301
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,875
I didn't want to die.
Not today. Not this way.

302
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,375
Not 'cause I fell in the sea.

303
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,458
That would've
been so boring!

304
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,958
[HENMI] It's so warm.
I've really been saved!

305
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,291
[SUGIMOTO] You should
warm your back, too.

306
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,583
And take off all
those wet clothes.

307
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,000
Uh. Take 'em off here?

308
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,458
[HENMI]
I'm sure that was Shiraishi

309
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,291
on the boat back there.

310
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,916
That soldier is
