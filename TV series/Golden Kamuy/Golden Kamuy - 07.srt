This is salmon <i>ruype</i> .

164
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,041
We make it by hanging
raw meat or fish

165
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,083
from a tree until it freezes.

166
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,000
It's half frozen so the
texture's real crunchy!

167
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,250
But if you keep chewing,
then it melts in your mouth.

Juicy!

169

Well, of course! " <i>Ruype</i> "
does mean "melted food"!

Can you... translate that?

174
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a <i>paskuma</i>
about fish. A legend.

175
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,875
She's talking about something
that happened in Hidaka,

176
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,583
Kushiro, Shiraoi-- everywhere.

177
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,625
Delegates from each village
took to the sea and brought all

178
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,000
the gold they had
gathered to one place.

179
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,250
After this continued
for several years,

180
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,583
villagers could no
longer catch salmon,

181
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,833
and life became very difficult.

182
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,791
The Ainu held a meeting
and agreed to stop

183
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,750
gathering the gold.

184
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,125
After that, they hid it away,
and to prevent conflict,

185
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,041
they forbade speaking of it.

186
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,958
Time passed.
People grew old and died.

187
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,916
Eventually, only one
man was left

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,958
who knew the
location of the gold.

189
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,666
And of course, he's dead.
Murdered by Nopperabo, huh?

190
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,833
[SHIRAISHI]
H-Hold up. Something's wrong.

191
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,708
This is our gold you're
talking about, right?

192
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,916
That means they spent
years gathering the stuff

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,291
from all over Hokkaido!

194

[ASIRPA]
I don't know.

195

I've never heard this

196
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,333
Then what if this
legend is actually true?

197
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,708
We thought we were looking
for 20 <i>kan</i> worth of gold,

198
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,916
but it could be much
more than that!

[TANIGAKI]
There is more.

[SHIRAISHI, SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

201

There's more than
you could imagine.

202
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,541
Like she said,

203
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,416
that story has been passed
down in secret by the Ainu.

204
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,208
My commander
confirmed it himself.

205
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,875
I trust his judgement.

206
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,833
He's an intelligence officer,
and a thorough one, at that.

You mean, Lt. Tsurumi?

208

[TSURUMI] Nopperabo wanted to
make sure no one could retrace

209
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,583
his steps to guess the
location of the gold,

210
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,125
so he spread false information.

211
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,958
Twenty <i>kan</i> is a reasonable
amount for one man to carry.

212
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,916
But in reality,
there was so much gold.

It's more than any
man could ever carry.

214

If Lt. Tsurumi is correct,

215
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,791
there could be a thousand times
more gold than you thought.

Is that really the smartest
thing to do with all that money?
