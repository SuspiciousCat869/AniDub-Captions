1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,666
Why do you find it so necessary

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,541
to use the students here
as subjects for your art?

3
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,541
Because this is an
all-girl boarding school.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,958
What are your thoughts

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,083
on Ousou Academy's curriculum,
Mister Makishima?

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,041
Darn it, we almost had them.

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,666
I already had the guys
put Rikako Ouryou

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,291
on the Wanted List.

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,708
We'll get her soon enough.

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,750
She's dead

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,166
What?

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,291
Come with me. We gotta talk.

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,500
Well, what is it You gotta
problem with me, spit it out.

14
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,083
I'm sorry, Kogami.

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,833
I was the one who got
emotional on this case.

16
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,625
And you weren't deluding
yourself about him,

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,250
either; you were right.

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,541
Don't worry about it.

19
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,250
If you took everything your
Enforcers said as gospel,

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,958
you wouldn't be a
very good Inspector.

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,875
I mean, you're supposed
to be skeptical, right?

22
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,500
Yeah, but...

23
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,166
It's like my prey's tail brushed
my nose as he ran right by me.

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,541
But you know for the
first time in a long while,

25
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,166
I actually feel good.

26
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,125
Nice.

27
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,208
Have you decided?

28
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,416
Yep.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,708
Would you please tag
this outfit combination

30
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,000
as one of my "Favorites"?

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,250
Roger, that!

32
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,416
Oh!

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,291
You gotta hot date, tonight!

34
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,791
It's not like that!

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,541
Holo Team!

36
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,583
Use the pattern we
agreed on yesterday!

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,875
Sure!

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,291
Sorry, not feeling it now.

39
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,458
I'm worried our viewers
might think it's tacky.

40
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,250
Well there are plenty of
different patterns we could try

41
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,416
How 'bout bringing him a gift?

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,833
I have some choices for you!

43
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,958
Also, I could arrange a
pretty flower bouquet--

44
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,125
Candy, it's not a date!

45
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625
Cancel action! Delete Memory!

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,208
As you wish, Akane!

47
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,375
Speculation Macro reset!

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,041
Turn on some news.

49
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,875
The Ministry of Welfare

50
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,291
just flagged a video
as "recommended."

51
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,583
Sure. That's fine.

52
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,291
Alright!

53
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,666
Today, I'm talking with
Toyohisa Senguji,

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,416
a pioneer of body cyberization,

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,041
and the chairman
of Teito Construction,

56
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,208
which specializes in
underground redevelopment.

57
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,666
my pleasure to be here today.

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,416
Recent years have seen
the use of cyborg technology

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,041
in all branches of medicine
become affordable and accepted.

60
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,666
But it still can be a bit
unsettling to meet someone

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,250
like Mister Senguji, whose
body is entirely cyborg,

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,208
save for his brain and
central nervous system.

63
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,625
It remains a mystery to me

64
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,958
Why people refuse to recognize

65
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,791
just how limiting their
natural biology can be.

66
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,458
"Limiting" is a strong word.

67
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,833
The ancient philosopher
Plato once said

68
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,666
"Our souls are
imprisoned in our bodies."

69
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Wow, you look like you're

70
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,250
in a bad mood already,
Mister Kogami.

71
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,416
That thing tried to bite me

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,458
because I tried
to have a cigarette.

73
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,291
What's your problem!

74
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,625
That robot touched
a nerve with you.

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,666
Sorry.

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,041
What?

77
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,125
Oh it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

78
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,458
I was fighting with
Candy this morning.

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,458
It's enabled me to experience

80
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,416
all sorts of new
activities in my life.

81
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,125
I honestly never
expected that beating

82
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,250
the disease of aging would
bring me this kind of happiness.

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,125
But that's something a
person can't understand

84
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,583
until they embrace
a cyborg body.

85
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,000
Sir, even with all our advances,

86
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,875
I understand that the
human brain cannot

87
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,416
live beyond one
hundred fifty years.

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,041
Being able to fully cyberize
a brain for an infinite lifespan

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,666
may prove to be
beyond science's reach.

90
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,166
Long as I keep
my brain stimulated,

91
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,875
I'll be able to squeeze
plenty of life from it!

92
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,416
Enough, I believe,
for them to find

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,208
a cyberization breakthrough
in the meantime.

94
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,166
Now I see. If that happens
while you're still alive

95
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,958
That's right

96
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,708
I'll have achieved immortality.

97
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,416
The Old Testament tell us

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,750
that God created
man in His own image.

99
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,458
Don't you think it's
time for us humans

100
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,625
to take some of God's
power for ourselves?

101
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,875
Do you think eternal
life's worth it

102
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,250
If it means you have
to become a cyborg?

103
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,166
I don't really care.

104
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,041
Life as a "latent criminal"
isn't something

105
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,041
you like to think
about going on forever.

106
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,958
But it's always possible
the social system

107
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,666
will continue evolving and
one day latent criminals

108
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
will have more rights.

109
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm starting to see why your
Psycho-Pass is always clear.

110
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,583
According to a recent survey,

111
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,916
a super-majority of respondents
said they'd be uncomfortable

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,750
with any more than fifty
percent of their bodies

113
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,250
being replaced with cybernetics.

114
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:44,208
I understand the hesitance the
public still has on this issue.

115
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,041
But we're all more
machine than we realize.

116
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:52,041
Take you for instance.
You're already quite the cyborg.

117
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,375
Mister Senguji,
I assure you I have

118
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,750
no artificial arms legs,
eyes, or other body parts.

119
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,250
But you do carry around

120
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,666
a portable information
terminal, don't you?

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,333
Well, yes,
but, doesn't everyone?

122
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,208
And a costume device?

123
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,291
Of course.

124
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,625
And your home's functions

125
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,333
are all fully automated
with an AI secretary, yes?

126
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,875
Yes.

127
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,416
So what would happen to you
if all your settings and data

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,208
in those devices were to be
lost in some kind of disaster?

129
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,875
I guess

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,333
I wouldn't be able to do

131
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,541
any work done until
they were restored.

132
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,125
When you hand over
so much of your life

133
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,458
and work to digital devices, the
insistence you're not a cyborg

134
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,541
doesn't sound very convincing
anymore, now does it?

135
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,916
For you, all these
terminals and AI programs

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,916
are practically a
second brain. Am I right?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
It's said the arc of progress

138
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,541
is the expansion of the
body's functionality.

139
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,583
That means,
man's history is also

140
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,875
the history of cyberization,
and vice-versa.

141
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,041
Like I said. We're more
machine than we think.

142
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,833
Yeah?

143
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,208
Hello? It's Kogami.

144
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,750
Alright. Hold on.

145
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,166
I don't see much
environment holo in use here.

146
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,708
Because that stuff irritates
the hell outta him.

147
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
Professor Saiga.
It's been a while.

148
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,166
Stop calling me Professor.

149
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,958
Don't you know how many
years it's been since I quit?

150
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,458
And this beauty must be

151
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,291
Akane Tsunemori I'm an
Inspector with the MWPSB.

152
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,083
Nice to meet you, sir.

153
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,333
You are welcome to
come inside, detectives.

154
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,958
Is coffee okay?

155
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,458
Sure.

156
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,875
Yes, please.

157
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,208
That's good.
'Cause coffee's all I got.

158
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,958
Hm.

159
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,958
Inspector Akane Tsunemori

160
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,625
Yes, sir?

161
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Are you from Chiba?

162
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,625
I am, actually.

163
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,875
I assume you've
got a decent amount

164
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,375
of natural athletic skill then.

165
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,000
And yet, I wonder why...

166
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,291
Hm...

167
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,958
You can't swim!

168
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,041
What!

169
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,166
I can tell your mother

170
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,250
and father are still
alive and healthy.

171
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,291
Though they are worrying about
when their only daughter's

172
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,458
going to find a boyfriend
and settle down.

173
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,875
How'd you...

174
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,500
And they don't like you working
for the MWPSB, do they?

175
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,250
And one of your grandparents...

176
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,083
Hm...

177
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,833
Your grandma.

178
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,750
She was quite
affectionate with you.

179
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,291
You think of yourself
as a "Grandma's Girl."

180
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,041
Which is good, because
it's a scientific fact

181
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,791
that the more time you spend
with the elderly as a child,

182
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,583
the better your
relationships will be

183
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,291
with Holo Avatar
AIs as an adult.

184
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,416
That's the pattern
you fit, Miss Tsunemori.

185
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,250
Uh... Yeah.

186
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,375
You're sharper than
ever, Mister Saiga.

187
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,208
How do you...

188
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,833
...read people like that?

189
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,708
It's simple observation,
my dear.

190
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,166
People manifest
hundreds of signs,

191
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,791
or "tells," about
themselves subconsciously.

192
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,375
Once you know what to look for,
reading those tells

193
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,708
and filling in the blanks
becomes second-nature.

194
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,208
Mister Jouji Saiga
I understand you're...

195
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,250
...also an expert in
clinical psychology.

196
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,375
I started in that career,
yes, but as I spent more time

197
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,458
assisting police investigations,
my interest naturally turned

198
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,666
to criminology and profiling.

199
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,791
I need your help.

200
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,750
Of course, what is
it I can do for you?

201
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,416
I'd like you to give
Inspector Tsunemori

202
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,375
a crash course on your skills.

203
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,791
Mainly, your profiling.

204
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,458
They say it's outdated,
but it seems to have value.

205
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,916
Watching you work is just-

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,125
I mean, you've made
me very interested.

207
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,250
I haven't seen such
passion in a long time.

208
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,583
This could be fun.

209
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,458
So, anything else?

210
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,291
I was hoping you've
kept a complete list

211
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,541
of all the students

212
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,166
who've attended your
courses over the years.

213
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,125
Is that an order from the MWPSB?

214
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
No, sir. It's a
personal request.

215
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,875
Good, because if it was an order
I would have flat-out refused.

216
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,583
Who're you looking for?

217
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,750
A guy who I'm pretty
sure is the worst criminal

218
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,416
since the creation
of the Sybil System.

219
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,125
You're being serious.

220
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,041
He's proven to be
exceptionally smart, genius.

221
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,375
And he must be physically fit.

222
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,708
His greatest skill,
though, is his charisma.

223
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,375
He rarely gets his hands dirty.

224
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,375
Instead, he brainwashes
and manipulates

225
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,541
others into murdering for him.

226
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,916
Think of him as
a music conductor,

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,291
orchestrating one
murder after another.

228
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,583
Kogami, Define "charisma"
for me, please.

229
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,125
Innate appeal.

230
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,500
A personality trait that can
convince others to do things.

231
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,250
I'll give that answer... a "B."

232
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,916
There are three elements
that comprise charisma.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,666
As you said, there's the innate
appeal, often found in leaders.

234
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,791
There's also a power to
make others feel good,

235
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,583
simply by being
in your presence.

236
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,833
And finally, there's the
ability to talk confidently

237
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,875
about all things
with all people.

238
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,000
Of these three
different elements,

239
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,750
which does he possess the most?

240
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,166
I would say this guy's got
all those traits in abundance.

241
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,833
This is Yukimori Shibata,
an Art teacher at Ousou Academy.

242
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,250
Or rather, this is
the real Shibata.

243
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,291
In reality, he's an
old man in a nursing home

244
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,125
who's never had any kind
of connection to the Academy.

245
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,291
The mastermind we're after
stole the old man's name

246
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,375
and background to get
a job at the school.

247
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,416
Pretty crafty of him to
steal a real ID instead

248
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,208
of trying to create
a new one from scratch.

249
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,000
The guy hid in plain sight,
working as a teacher.

250
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,625
I can't decide whether
that's brilliant or stupid.

251
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,708
About that, sir

252
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,541
All the school's video
was destroyed.

253
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,458
The only thing we were
able to piece back together

254
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,375
was a short sound file.

255
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,416
That left two ways to image him:

256
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Create an old-school
photofit picture,

257
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,750
or bring in a composite artist.

258
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,083
Needless to say we
tried both methods.

259
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
And it sounds
like neither worked.

260
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,750
No.

261
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,250
So we're back to square one.

262
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Our only image is a blurry
photo Sasayama took years ago.

263
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,791
Did you at least get
something out of it?

264
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,541
Yes! Of course!

265
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,583
He's a fantastic teacher.

266
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,625
In fact, I don't
get why his lectures

267
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,875
aren't in the MWPSB archives?

268
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,125
They would never do that.

269
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,625
What's the real story with him?

270
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,916
It was back when the
University System

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,750
still existed alongside
the Sybil System.

272
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,000
Saiga's criminology courses

273
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,000
were specifically set up
to train investigators.

274
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,541
But one day they
found a big problem.

275
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,916
The hues of his
students became clouded,

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,291
and their Crime Coefficients
saw a big jump.

277
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,666
Relax, not for every student.

278
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,750
One-on-one lectures
like yours today are fine.

279
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,958
And besides, your Hue's
impossible to cloud anyway.

280
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,416
Yeah, but, to think listening

281
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,666
to a guy speak could raise
your Crime Coefficient.

282
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,250
Say there's a dark swamp,
and you can't see the bottom.

283
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,666
If you want to know what's
down there, you gotta jump.

284
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,916
Mister Saiga can handle it,

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,416
because he swims
down there all the time.

286
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,125
But for most of his students,
it's a new experience,

287
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,291
and they can't
always surface safely.

288
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,791
They can't handle
what's in the swamp.

289
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,375
You seem like someone
who could dive in,

290
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,125
touch the bottom and come
back without a scratch.

291
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:54,916
Thanks.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,541
But I doubt that.

293
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,250
If you were to ask our dear
friend the Sibyl System,

294
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,833
I'd hit the black mud
and never come back.

295
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,708
What kind of animal do you
think is the most cunning,

296
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,875
and has the lowest
risk of going extinct,

297
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,458
no matter how many
are hunted and killed?

298
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,416
That can only be Man.

299
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,166
That was too easy for you.

300
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,291
Nowadays

301
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,458
It's hard for the common citizen
to get a hunting license.

302
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,208
Makishima I appreciate,
your company.

303
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,458
That pipe of yours...

304
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,375
That's not ivory, is it?

305
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
I suppose I haven't
shown it to you yet.

306
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,750
Excluding the mouthpiece,

307
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,083
this pipe is made from
Rikako Ouryou's bones.

308
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,625
Oh.

309
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,125
When I inhale it like this...

310
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,833
My mind feels as sharp
as a young man's again.

311
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,083
It's like I'm breathing in
the souls of my terrified prey,

312
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,833
so that I might feast upon
their life-giving energy.

313
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,958
Obviously, you've overcome
your body's aging.

314
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,666
Your only worry
left is your mind.

315
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,291
That's exactly correct.

316
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,541
To maintain a healthy mind and
body requires some sacrifices.

317
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,791
Particularly, the
lives of others.

318
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,666
Unfortunately, many of
those seeking eternal life,

319
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,333
neglect feeding their minds

320
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,583
in favor of keeping
their bodies young.

321
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,458
This has one result: A long
life, as beautiful zombies.

322
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,916
It's a rather foolish
end, don't you think?

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,958
The thrill you get
from a successful hunt

324
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,416
It's like a reward for
coming face to face

325
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,291
with death and surviving.

326
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,541
You're quite right.

327
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,500
In hunting, the more
dangerous your prey,

328
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,666
the more potent the stimulation
your brain gets from killing it.

329
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,333
Then I have good news for you.

330
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,583
I think I can arrange

331
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,833
for your next prey to
be the most potent yet.

332
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,250
Go on.

333
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,083
He's an Enforcer.

334
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,208
How intriguing.

335
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,333
His name is...

336
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,458
So much for that.

337
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,666
I thought for sure
we'd find something

338
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,541
in his lecture attendee list.

339
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,583
That's how it goes

340
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,500
But as long as
Makishima's alive,

341
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,375
he must be leaving
some kind of trail.

342
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,958
I heard you took
Inspector Tsunemori

343
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,125
to meet with Jouji Saiga today.

344
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,208
Yeah.

345
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,333
I asked Kogami to
take me there, sir

346
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,583
What're you thinking, Kogami?

347
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,500
Trying to drag her
down into the mud?

348
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,916
Make her someone
who gives it all up

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,875
to be a latent
criminal like you?

350
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,166
Hey, that's not true!

351
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,958
And I don't want you
treating me like a child!

352
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,500
That is exactly what you are!
A clueless naive child!!

353
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,458
Why do you think we have
different classifications

354
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,958
for Inspectors and Enforcers?

355
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,375
It's to lower the risk of a
healthy person's Psycho-Pass

356
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,250
becoming clouded during
a criminal investigation.

357
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,750
We have latent criminals,

358
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,833
with no hope of returning
to society do our dirty work.

359
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,166
That way, Inspector,

360
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,416
you can fulfill your duty
and protect your mind.

361
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,041
That doesn't sound
like teamwork!

362
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,208
Is our job to solve crimes,

363
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,500
or to protect our
own Psycho-Passes?

364
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,958
Just tell me what's
important, so I know!

365
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,333
Akane, are you trying
to throw away your career?

366
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,041
You're gonna sacrifice
everything you've built so far?

367
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,916
For what!

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,458
Sir, it's...

369
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,583
It's true that I'm a rookie!

370
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,083
And I do have great
respect for your seniority!

371
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,166
But don't forget,
I am still an Inspector,

372
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,291
and we are on equal
footing in terms of rank.

373
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,208
I can manage my Hue
just fine, thank you!

374
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,875
Just 'cause you're my senior
doesn't give you the right

375
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,750
to keep embarrassing
me in the workplace,

376
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,458
or to question my Psycho-Pass

377
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,291
and abilities in
front of our Enforcers.

378
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,041
I can't believe his nerve!

379
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,666
Whoa, where are you going?

380
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,416
To file a complaint
with the bureau chief.

381
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,750
Any chance you'll let me
talk ya outta that, Missy?

382
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,083
Try.

383
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,916
Ginoza's father, well, poor
guy's a latent criminal.

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,833
What?

385
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,791
Ginoza was a little
kid when they first

386
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,208
put the Sibyl System
into operation.

387
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,791
In those early days, rumors
about latent criminals spread

388
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,791
around the country like
wildfire, causing mass panic.

389
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
If anyone showed a
high Crime Coefficient

390
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,041
that was enough for the
whole family to get treated

391
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,833
as if they were
all latent criminals.

392
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,500
Can't imagine being a kid

393
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,833
and going through
something like that.

394
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,375
When a detective
immerses himself in a case,

395
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,208
sooner or later the Sibyl System

396
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,541
will start keeping
an eye on him, too.

397
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,333
Most think of criminals
and cops as opposites

398
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,666
but they're actually
on the same wave.

399
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,916
Now we've got the
Enforcer and Inspector

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,333
arrangement to minimize risk,

401
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,375
but in the early days,
many detectives

402
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,750
saw themselves classified
as latent criminals.

403
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,791
Ginoza's Dad was one of
those unlucky detectives.

404
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,666
I never knew that.

405
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,708
This is why he comes
down so hard on those

406
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,041
he thinks are unnecessarily
risking their Hues.

407
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,333
It happened with his
old partner, Kogami.

408
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,916
Yes, I'm aware.

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,166
Ginoza feels he was betrayed
twice.

410
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,833
First by his father,
then by his best friend.

411
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,208
This is why he acts the
way he does toward you.

412
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,375
He doesn't want it
to ever happen again.

413
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,875
But does he have to be a jerk?

414
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,666
No, you're right. He doesn't.

415
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,166
But, Missy you got lotsa friends
and family back home, don't ya?

416
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,750
Times have changed some,
but one thing's certain:

417
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,000
if your Psycho-Pass
ever comes up clouded,

418
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,208
the people you care
about will still stuffer.

419
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,625
That's why we
Enforcers are here.

420
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,458
To help ya avoid that.

421
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,083
Does Mister Kogami
see his Enforcer job

422
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,333
the same way that you do?

423
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,250
He used to.

424
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,541
But now, I don't know...

425
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,041
I don't think he
cares about anything

426
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,000
beyond finding Makishima
and getting his revenge.

427
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,833
I'm afraid I won't
capture him alive.

428
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,750
Is that okay?

429
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,166
Why yes of course.

430
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,916
I expect nothing less from you.

431
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,250
I should mention something
I don't think you've noticed.

432
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,375
Shinya Kogami, whenever you
mention him in conversation...

433
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,625
You get such an amused
look on your face.
