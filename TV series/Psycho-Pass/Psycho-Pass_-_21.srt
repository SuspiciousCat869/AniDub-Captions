1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
So that's it?

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,000
It's really that easy to adjust
the Ukanomitama virus?

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,041
Yes, the process itself
should be automated,

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
or close to it, as long as
the equipment still works.

5
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,625
I would guess that's why
they chose Ukanomitama,

6
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,708
because it is so easy to update.

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,166
A good virus, transformed
into a destructive disease.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,791
We thought we'd built
the perfect iron wall

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,291
for our food supply.

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,875
In truth it was more like
a double-edged sword.

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,875
All right let's go.

12
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,333
And now we come to one
of my favorite stories

13
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,541
from the Book of Matthew.

14
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,250
Jesus told them another parable.

15
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,083
The kingdom of
heaven is like a man

16
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,541
who sowed good
seed in his field.

17
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,166
But while everyone was sleeping,

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,291
his enemy came and sowed
weeds among the wheat,

19
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,958
and went away.

20
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,458
The surest way to buy some time.

21
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,958
And yet, he didn't do that.

22
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,125
Security's still active.

23
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,166
I need another way in.

24
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,583
Well, well...

25
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,958
Damn it. This place is huge.

26
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,416
It has to be.

27
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,666
These machines centrally
manage the defense virus

28
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,500
and distribute it to
the entire Hokuriku area.

29
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,916
Hard to believe a
facility this big can be

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,750
fully-automated,
with no humans on site.

31
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,291
The bigger the prey,

32
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,666
the easier it is to hit
the target on their back.

33
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,125
Especially when you're working

34
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,791
with a poisoned needle
powerful enough to kill a whale.

35
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,625
These tactics are
just like Makishima.

36
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,541
It's probably from Kogami.

37
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,041
I'm guessing he saw us land.

38
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,041
He has to be somewhere nearby.

39
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,875
Tsunemori here.

40
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,208
Didn't think you'd
get here this fast.

41
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,125
Then you shouldn't be
underestimating the bureau.

42
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,708
You're not the only person

43
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,083
who can chase
Makishima into a corner.

44
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,875
He's already in the facility.

45
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,250
He must be using the
equipment Professor Kudama

46
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,708
left in the university's lab

47
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,958
to alter the Ukanomitama
virus as we speak.

48
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,958
And that's assuming
he's not already finished.

49
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,416
He won't pull this off.
We can't let him.

50
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,083
Then we've gotta be quick.

51
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,958
Before he distributes his
skewed version of the virus,

52
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,791
we've got to shut down
the entire facility.

53
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,250
You should be able
to cut off the power

54
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,208
to this place under the
authority of the MWPSB, right?

55
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,083
If we do that,
it won't just shut down

56
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,458
the factory's machines,
but the security system, too.

57
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,666
That's what you want, isn't it?

58
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,416
You're trying to use us
to lower the defenses,

59
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,916
so that you can get to Makishima
before we can and take him out.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,625
Isn't that right Kogami?

61
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,625
We'll never let you do that.

62
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,625
That man wants to
bring down this society.

63
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,125
That means the MWPSB
has only one choice.

64
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,083
Cut off the power. Do it
and you save our country.

65
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm gonna find a
way to save you also.

66
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,250
I will not make
Shinya Kogami a murderer.

67
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,083
Then we've got ourselves a race.

68
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,208
The security here.

69
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,625
Can't we have it
transferred to our control?

70
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,958
So that we can
shut down the plant

71
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,833
without leaving it undefended?

72
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,791
That process would
take some time.

73
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,041
Makishima could put us into
check-mate while we sit.

74
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm afraid we have
no other option here.

75
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,041
We have to kill all the power
like Kogami wants us to.

76
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,583
Kunizuka?

77
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,833
I've disabled the
command to switch

78
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,916
to the secondary power supply.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,125
All we have to do now is cut
off the main line and we're set.

80
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,250
There's something I'd like
to ask the both of you.

81
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,041
If you do encounter
Mr. Kogami somewhere in there.

82
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,125
And if his Crime
Coefficient is over 300

83
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,458
so it activates the Eliminator.

84
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,416
Will you promise to call me
in before you shoot him?

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,833
And what's the point
of you being there?

86
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,833
I've got a trump card
I can use against him.

87
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,500
Just trust me.
Let me handle this.

88
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,083
We're going after Makishima now.

89
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,583
This time you'll help me, right?

90
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,416
The Dominator will assist.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,125
I'm glad to hear that.

92
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,375
Then lock this gun on
Paralyzer with the safety off.

93
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,750
You can do that
for me, can't you?

94
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,333
The Dominator determines
its enforcement mode based

95
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,750
on the measured
Crime Coefficients.

96
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,250
This is the basis for the system

97
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,750
that maintains the
current public safety.

98
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,208
It will not be
changed or violated.

99
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,666
Makishima threatens that public
safety on a massive scale.

100
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,125
To stop him and
protect ourselves,

101
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,125
we need suitable weapons.

102
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,666
If we can't use the Dominators,

103
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,958
we'll have no choice but to
depend on more primitive arms.

104
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,333
And that could be lethal.

105
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,333
Killing him would be worse than
paralyzing him, don't you think?

106
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,625
That would be a result of
your lack of resourcefulness.

107
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,250
It's a fact our resources
are limited in this case.

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,208
Our chances of
capturing Makishima alive

109
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,250
without someone getting
hurt aren't likely at all.

110
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,458
If you grant me an exception,

111
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,000
those chances get
a whole lot better.

112
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,166
Think of the end results,

113
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,791
and the justice you're
trying to enforce.

114
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,416
You're good at calculating
risk and reward, aren't you?

115
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,666
Beginning now, and ending when
Shogo Makishima is captured,

116
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,125
we will grant an exception on
the applicable terminal device.

117
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,333
Safety will remain unlocked.

118
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,583
Enforcement mode:
Non-Lethal Paralyzer.

119
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,750
Please exercise maximum
discretion when using weapon.

120
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,375
Do not allow other detectives

121
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,708
to become aware
of this exception.

122
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,333
I understand.

123
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,541
Something wrong, Missy?

124
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,041
Cause you haven't
been acting like yourself

125
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,208
ever since the
Chief called you in.

126
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,791
I know it's prob'ly
none of my business,

127
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,916
but some burdens can be
too heavy to carry alone.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,458
Are you worried about me?

129
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,291
I am. You're reminding
me of Kogami.

130
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,333
I don't want to see the end

131
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,666
of another good
Inspector's career.

132
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,333
That's what happens
when you're in too deep.

133
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,500
Well if you're so concerned,

134
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,125
you want to check
my Crime Coefficient?

135
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,333
Hey, that's not what I-

136
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,625
No it's okay.

137
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,083
Go ahead and point
your Dominator at me.

138
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,875
I'll clear the record of it with
my authority as an Inspector.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,166
Crime Coefficient: Twenty Four.

140
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,666
Target is a
registered Inspector.

141
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,833
See?

142
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,750
Right now I'm exactly
the kind of person

143
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,875
that the
Sibyl System wants here.

144
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,125
Guess so.

145
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,458
Please proceed Miss Kunizuka.
We're ready now.

146
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,500
Copy that.

147
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,208
I'm separating
the entire facility

148
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,083
from the main power grid.

149
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,000
Not bad at all for the police.

150
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
Yes.

151
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,250
Well we know one thing at least:

152
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,208
Makishima's bio-terrorism
plot has failed.

153
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,333
If he's the genius
everyone says he is,

154
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,041
won't he realize it's
over now and try to escape?

155
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,833
I'm not so sure.

156
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,625
It's true Makishima's put
a great deal of thought

157
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,583
into his plans and
executed them carefully,

158
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,916
but that doesn't
mean everything's

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,458
just a calculation to him.

160
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,125
You think he'll stick to his
plan even with the power out?

161
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,250
If he still thinks
there's a way.

162
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,666
Then he will try it.

163
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,083
Right now we're simply
preventing the emergency power

164
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,000
from kicking in
automatically, aren't we?

165
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,166
Yes.

166
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,958
Then it can still be
switched on manually

167
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,416
using the control board
inside this facility.

168
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,916
That would bring
the plant back online.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,208
This isn't over yet.

170
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,458
That's in the
central control room.

171
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,791
Should we cast a net?

172
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,916
Hold on.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,166
If he is thinking
rationally he'll try

174
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,625
to escape while he can.

175
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,708
We don't have
time for a side trip.

176
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,750
Okay then we should split up.

177
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,541
I'll check the control room.

178
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,333
Inspector Ginoza,
I want you to look

179
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,125
for him in the university's lab.

180
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,375
I'll go with
Inspector Tsunemori.

181
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,916
I can run a hard-patch into
the main security console.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,375
And with Shion helping
from Headquarters.

183
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,000
We may at least
be able to control

184
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,916
the security cameras
so we can spot this guy.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
And I guess that
makes us the lucky dogs

186
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,500
in charge of chasing him.

187
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,541
Come on, what are you
making that face for?

188
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,166
This is where we men get
to puff out our chests.

189
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,916
Damn it.

190
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,708
Did something happen at
the Ministry of Welfare?

191
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,208
Why do you ask,
am I acting differently?

192
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,791
Of everyone on this team.

193
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,083
I'd say you're
contributing the most.

194
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,791
Yet there's a cloud over
your head you can't shake.

195
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,791
I may want to give up, but
that won't resolve anything.

196
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,666
I just have to keep on moving.

197
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,291
No matter how small it is,
there's still hope.

198
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,416
And as long as I cling to that.

199
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,875
I can do my job and
see this to the end.

200
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
When you first joined
us as a new Inspector,

201
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,166
I admit, I had my doubts.

202
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,416
I thought you were
a naïve little girl

203
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,333
who couldn't possibly
handle this work.

204
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,500
You're right. I was so naïve.

205
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,375
No. You've proven my first
impression was completely wrong.

206
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,833
At this point there's
no doubt in my mind.

207
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,875
I know that I can put
my life in your hands.

208
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,208
You've earned that.

209
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,541
I think you're giving
me way too much credit.

210
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,708
Good. All clear.

211
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
Did we make it in time?

212
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,875
We're still assuming that
he'd be in this location.

213
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,500
You're right.

214
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,500
And it's strange
there's no one else here.

215
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,583
What?

216
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,791
He would've predicted
what Makishima

217
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,666
would do next a whole
lot better than me.

218
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,625
If this were the correct answer.

219
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,583
Mr. Kogami would've
made it here before us.

220
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,333
So why not?

221
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,500
I must be overlooking something.

222
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,791
You won't like it.

223
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,250
But I still need the answer.

224
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,666
That's my favorite
kind of question.

225
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,666
You did help him get away.

226
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,125
Isn't that right?

227
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,833
You're gonna keep up
your interrogation

228
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,416
at a time like this?

229
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,708
Your logic. Let Kogami
work outside the law.

230
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,083
Screw the system
if it gets the job done.

231
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,625
That's the crude,
selfish justice

232
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,291
of an old-fashioned
hunting dog like you.

233
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,458
Can you tell me
I'm wrong? Can you?

234
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,750
I know it's him.

235
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,583
He's the one you always rely on.

236
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,916
You don't expect
anything from me.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,416
Like catching Makishima.

238
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,833
You never thought
I had a chance, did you?

239
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,458
Kogami's an Enforcer
and a latent criminal.

240
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,125
He and I have gone
down the same dark road.

241
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,750
But you're still
on a different path

242
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,791
and I'll do anything
to keep it that way.

243
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,083
So I did what I thought was best

244
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,583
from the bottom
of my heart, son.

245
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,708
You can make
justifications for anything.

246
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,875
Bad guys run and
detectives go after them.

247
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,333
That's the assumption we make.

248
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,458
Inspector?

249
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,041
But Makishima looks
at things differently.

250
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,833
He understands how
badly we want to catch him.

251
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,708
He knows how afraid we
are of letting him slip by.

252
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,250
And he knows how
desperate that makes us.

253
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,791
Ginoza and Masaoka!

254
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,208
Wait, please!

255
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,958
It's too dangerous!

256
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,458
I need you to stay here.

257
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,875
Someone has to be
sure that Makishima

258
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,875
doesn't access
the emergency power.

259
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,083
Don't let him get near it,

260
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,458
destroy the whole console if you
have to!

261
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,750
Inspector Ginoza!

262
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,125
Can you hear me?

263
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,708
Don't move!

264
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,000
Nobuchika!

265
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,000
Hold on.

266
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,500
Behind you!

267
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,625
You trying to blow yourself
up and take me with you?

268
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,625
You honestly believe I'd
do a stupid thing like that?

269
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,916
Don't let that
man go at any cost!

270
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,083
You're a detective!
Fulfill your duty!

271
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,666
That bastard.

272
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,458
You idiot!

273
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,916
Why did you let him go?

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,708
Why? What kind of
detective are you?

275
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,458
I'm no detective.

276
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,083
I don't deserve the title.

277
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,791
You are my son, after all.

278
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,416
Look at those eyes.

279
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,625
They look just the
same as mine used to.

280
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,791
Back when I was young.

281
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:13,708
Dad, no. Don't go like this!

282
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,750
Why? Why would you?

283
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,708
It's too late now!

284
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,625
So you finally ditched
that kangaroo justice,

285
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,041
and now you've got some
real bloodlust, haven't you?

286
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:55,041
In the end, you're everything
I always hoped you'd be.

287
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,166
Is that right?

288
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,833
That's funny 'cause I have
no hopes for you at all.

289
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,541
You can't feign indifference
after coming this far.

290
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,416
Spare me the arrogance.

291
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,166
You're nothing special to me.

292
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,708
You're just a bag of trash
the city overlooked,

293
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,583
and I'm here to finish the job.

294
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,208
I know you feel bitter
for being rejected

295
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,416
and left out of
society your entire life.

296
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,958
Beneath your bullshit you
just couldn't bear the solitude.

297
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,666
You're no different
than the little kid whining

298
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,916
because he isn't
part of the game.

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,250
You really say
some funny things.

300
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,166
My solitude? As if that's
only applicable to me?

301
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,000
Really, who isn't alone in
this society we've constructed?

302
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,833
The time when our connection
to others defined us is gone.

303
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,458
We've lost all sense of self.

304
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,125
In this world where
we're watched over

305
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,291
by the system and
live by its standards,

306
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,041
a community is no longer needed.

307
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,375
It's not even relevant.

308
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,416
We all live in our own little
cell, and the system tames us

309
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,291
by giving each of us
our personal serenity.
