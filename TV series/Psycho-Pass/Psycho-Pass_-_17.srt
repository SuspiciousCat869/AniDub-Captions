1
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,583
Makishima's in custody.

2
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,208
And all the Helmet Criminals
have been eliminated.

3
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,500
I guess it's all over then.
The case is closed.

4
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,166
No, Kagari's still
among the missing.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,666
Of course. They're also saying
a Division Two Enforcer

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
escaped in the confusion.

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,333
Hey, Inspector.

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,708
Kagari wouldn't run away
like that, would he?

9
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,208
I can't decide.

10
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,541
Do you think we won this battle?

11
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,750
It's not about winning. It's
about picking up the pieces.

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,625
We only work once
there's a victim.

13
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,291
In that way, we've
lost before we've started.

14
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,500
But in this case,
versus Makishima,

15
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,416
we at least clawed
our way to a draw.

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,250
It's not ideal,
but it is what it is.

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,500
The idea of the Sibyl System

18
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,291
guaranteeing safety
now seems like a joke.

19
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,875
That kinda perfect society
has always been an illusion.

20
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,666
I'd say, in many ways,

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,583
the world's as dangerous
as it's ever been.

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,791
It is?

23
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,125
We live in an age where
people value immediacy

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,458
and convenience over safety.

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,583
Our government asked us
all to take a series of risks

26
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,500
but they're so dispersed
throughout our daily lives,

27
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,875
that no one ever noticed the
accumulated threat they pose.

28
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,416
No that's wrong.

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,250
We did notice
but pretended not to.

30
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,041
We spent our lives
looking the other way.

31
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,958
Precisely because
we knew the danger.

32
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,125
That's how everyone
kept their sanity

33
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,833
in this system that's
so clearly flawed.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,958
You think all of us including
me were really that clever?

35
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,125
Not just following blindly?

36
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,666
Look, I'm generalizing here.

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
Obviously there are
all kinds of people

38
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,625
and some may never think at all.

39
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,291
But I think more often than not

40
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,708
humans are clever wolves,
not dumb sheep.

41
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,416
We just convince ourselves
we don't know what's happening.

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,333
To avoid the responsibility.

43
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,583
Sorry, I guess I'm rambling now.

44
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,875
Honestly I'm just
as nervous as you are.

45
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:08,166
About how they'll
judge Makishima.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,416
I don't know what happens next.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Any kind of trial is
still a helluva lot harder

48
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,916
than just pointing
a Dominator at him.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,791
But there's no way we can
let him beat us and walk free.

50
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,083
We got irrefutable evidence

51
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,416
he committed mass murder
and civil unrest.

52
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,625
And there's still the
matter of figuring out

53
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,041
what the hell
happened to Kagari.

54
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,208
What we know is that
he went to the basement.

55
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:38,125
After that all
communication with him ceased.

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,333
The city continues to pick
up the pieces from the--

57
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,375
It's like a goddamn
pandemic swept through.

58
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,458
A Psycho-Hazard is
a disease of the mind.

59
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,250
When it spreads,
it's the same as a plague.

60
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,375
Thousands needing
mental health care.

61
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,250
Shelters packed
with the wounded.

62
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,125
Crippled infrastructure
wreaking havoc on the economy.

63
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,625
Makishima was a monster who
will haunt this town for years.

64
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,750
It's way too early to talk
in the past tense, honey.

65
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,041
Hell, we don't even know
what kinda sentence he'll get.

66
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,291
The Judiciary's been
abolished for years.

67
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,250
Do the higher-ups even remember
how to prosecute someone

68
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,708
with old-fashioned
evidence anymore?

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,833
Guess we're counting
you Inspector.

70
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,708
Don't get too
friendly. Enforcer.

71
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,416
Oh-kay!

72
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,583
It's the Chief.
She wants to see me.

73
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,125
The Minister of Welfare
has formed a special team

74
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,333
to investigate and prosecute
all the Makishima cases.

75
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,125
In short, you and the PSB no
longer have any authority on it.

76
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,458
What!

77
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,708
Understand this case is unique.

78
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,375
Questioning him is tricky.

79
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,291
Our medical staff will have
to treat anyone he talks to.

80
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,083
And the whole case will
be classified top secret.

81
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,666
We suspect
Makishima was involved

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,416
in dozens of cases
over the years,

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,208
and how can we hope
to investigate them

84
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,583
if he's off limits?

85
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,125
You would be preventing
us from doing our jobs.

86
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,458
It's essential that our
division be in the loop!

87
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,041
Are any of those
cases you mention

88
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,125
still classified as unsolved?

89
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,958
Not officially. But the truth...

90
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,375
Makishima will be treated as
a lab sample then disposed of.

91
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,916
If he hasn't been already.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,833
Instead of worrying
about a captured criminal.

93
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,458
Don't you have a bigger
problem on your hands

94
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,416
back at Division One?

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,541
An Enforcer escaped
in the attack.

96
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,375
And the trail's already cold.

97
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,083
Hold on. There's no
evidence he ran away.

98
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,125
The Sibyl System has
been restored to full power.

99
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,291
The only reason Kagari
hasn't been picked up

100
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,541
yet is because he knows how
to avoid the drones as he moves.

101
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,291
As of now, we're
holding you responsible.

102
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,416
That's not.

103
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,250
That's bullshit!

104
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,333
Give me one good reason why!

105
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,083
You can't talk to
your superior this way!

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,916
I don't give a damn
about our ranks right now!

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,333
Don't you think it's
strange we're not allowed

108
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,000
to question the mass
murderer we arrested?

109
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,833
This isn't my decision!!

110
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,375
If you wanna go complain.

111
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,333
Yeah, I'll walk right into the
Chief's office and say "Hi.

112
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,666
I'm an Enforcer!"
You know that can't happen!

113
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,041
But maybe I should try.

114
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,708
After all, it'd be your
ass in trouble, not mine.

115
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,916
So, what do you think's
gonna happen now?

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,125
Nothing, which is
exactly what they want.

117
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,958
Alright, settle down!

118
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,583
For now, we gotta put
everything into finding Kagari.

119
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,041
If he truly has gone rogue,

120
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,625
whatever he does out
there now could mean

121
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,041
the end of our whole program.

122
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,666
It's been a long time, Shogo.

123
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,083
It's nice to see that you
haven't changed at all.

124
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,333
You're Chief Kasei,
the head of the MWPSB.

125
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,791
Isn't that right?

126
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,583
We've never had the
pleasure of meeting.

127
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,000
Well.

128
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,625
Unlike you my
appearance has changed

129
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,958
quite a bit over the
last three years but

130
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,208
I owe you a personal
apology for this.

131
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,750
A long time ago you
let me borrow a book.

132
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,625
It got lost in the shuffle

133
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,041
when I had a little
run-in with the law.

134
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,083
Oh.

135
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,708
I found a replacement.

136
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,541
This is a surprise.

137
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,375
You're not you.
You're Kouzaburou Touma.

138
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,458
This brings back memories.

139
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,458
Hard to believe it's
been three years isn't it?

140
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,083
Yes it is.

141
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,708
When I heard you got captured,

142
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,708
I assumed I'd never
see you again.

143
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,541
And I suppose I was right.

144
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,958
How then?

145
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,708
Some kind of plastic surgery?

146
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,416
No, it couldn't be.

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,541
That's an entirely
different body.

148
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,500
Recall that your recent
accomplice, Toyohisa Senguji,

149
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,083
achieved a passable form
of whole body cyberization.

150
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,958
But this form is of
a build quality that

151
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,000
not even the richest
private citizen could afford.

152
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,791
You can't tell the difference

153
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,083
between this body
and a real one, can you?

154
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,416
The only element left
of the Kouzaburou Touma

155
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,250
you knew is his brain.

156
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,875
What's really going on here?

157
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,833
I can comprehend a cyborg body,

158
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,208
but how does a serial killer
become the Chief of the PSB?

159
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,375
Is this supposed to
be some kind of joke?

160
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,041
No. It's no joke the
truth of the matter is

161
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,916
I'm not the only Kasei.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,791
And I'm not always
the one controlling

163
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,541
this particular version of her.

164
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,291
Each one of our brains is
kept unitized and healthy.

165
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,375
This allows for them
to be easily swapped.

166
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,291
Basically, we each take turns
piloting this android body.

167
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,625
In truth.

168
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,041
It's a nice diversion from
our everyday activities.

169
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,500
Who are these others?

170
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,208
Ah yes.

171
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,625
Today I am a diplomat of sorts.

172
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,333
Because of our
prior relationship.

173
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,750
They entrusted me with
Kasei's body in your presence.

174
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,833
We make an effort to not
show the public our true forms.

175
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,375
But everyone grows up feeling
our reach into their lives.

176
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,291
And fearing our power.

177
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,083
Your self included, old friend.

178
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,750
You know us all
as the Sibyl System.

179
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,541
There's no way in hell
Kagari would suddenly go AWOL.

180
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,833
Sure he gets worked up.

181
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,750
But he's not the
type to run off.

182
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,583
He weighed his
options a long time ago

183
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,041
and chose the Enforcer life.

184
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,291
Kagari disappeared.

185
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,541
Because someone made it happen.

186
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,666
So what, you think he
was abducted or something?

187
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,000
Or he was killed in a way that
wouldn't leave any trace behind.

188
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,541
Like with a Dominator
set to Decomposer.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,375
Hello. Tsunemori here.

190
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,458
I'm on the streets where
a citizen filed a report.

191
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,750
He found an abandoned,
broken Dominator.

192
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:08,000
We're about twenty
miles from Nona Tower.

193
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,333
Even considering all
the chaos from the riots.

194
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,333
There's no way Kagari
could've made it this far

195
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,500
without showing up on camera.

196
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,416
Scans confirm,
this is Kagari's piece.

197
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,208
It's really beat up, though.

198
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,375
Even the hardened
GPS sensor's broken.

199
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,083
Did he break it himself?

200
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,833
So we'd be unable to track him?

201
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,375
Or it's a set up.

202
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,000
Maybe someone's trying to make
it look like Kagari ran off.

203
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,375
As for your recent attack.

204
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,833
Your target clearly
reflects your intelligence.

205
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,208
In fact, your helper
friend was able

206
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,625
to find the truth that you seek.

207
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,875
What in the hell
am I looking at here?

208
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,125
It's the truth.

209
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,750
The real form of
the Sibyl System!

210
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,000
We say the Sibyl System
is a PDP architecture.

211
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,333
Basically super computers

212
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,750
performing parallel
distributed processing.

213
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,166
In a massive network.

214
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,916
There's some truth to that.

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,291
But it's not the
whole truth, either.

216
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,666
Sibyl's ability to use
a knowledge base

217
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,583
and perform inferences, is not
achieved by performance gains

218
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,375
in what we think of as
conventional computing.

219
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,416
Rather, by organically
expanding a system

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
that was already able
to do those things,

221
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,750
and then parallelizing it,

222
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,791
we were able to achieve
exponential increases

223
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,541
over baseline performance.

224
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,333
No civilians are aware of this,

225
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,250
but the incorporation of human
brain activity as a means

226
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,541
of speeding up
silicon computers was

227
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,875
first put into successful
practice over fifty years ago.

228
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,333
But by keeping this brain
computer technology a secret,

229
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,083
and methodically maturing
and implementing it,

230
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,291
ours is now the only
country on Earth still

231
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,875
under the peaceful rule of law.

232
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,875
The best part is, we don't
even have to destroy it.

233
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,750
Just making this
information public

234
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
will lead to the
downfall of our society.

235
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,375
And then the riots
will really begin.

236
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,708
The Sibyl System
currently comprises

237
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,208
two hundred forty
seven member brains.

238
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,708
So long as a minimum of
two hundred of the members

239
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,916
are connected and in session,
the System is able

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,041
to continuously monitor
and judge the Psycho-Passes

241
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,250
of every person in the country.

242
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,458
The abilities of
artificial computers

243
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,666
to judge human
emotions are remedial.

244
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,541
They can only handle
Hue Check data.

245
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,458
But, since Crime Coefficients
reflect the profound elements

246
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,416
of human nature, their
analysis demands an expansive,

247
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,875
adaptable range of
intelligence and judgment.

248
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,666
This is what the human brains
of the Sibyl System provide.

249
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,000
What a farce.

250
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
They promised a
society managed by fair

251
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,958
and impartial
machine intelligence.

252
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,291
A law free of petty human ego.

253
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,625
People only accepted Sibyl

254
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,541
because that's what they
thought they were getting.

255
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,625
But it was a lie.
Sibyl's arbitrary and unfair.

256
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,208
It's nothing but a committee of
pickled brains in mason jars.

257
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,458
No! It is logical and
overwhelmingly fair!

258
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,041
Sibyl's members may be organic,

259
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,000
but we are able to judge
and supervise the people

260
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,416
because we are so
different from them.

261
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,125
The first qualification needed

262
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,750
to be a member is a
rare personality type.

263
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,333
One that does not fit
in with society by virtue

264
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,166
of being unable to empathize
with the suffering of others.

265
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,875
One that does not
become lost in emotion.

266
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,875
One that is clinical
and detached.

267
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,708
A personality that
observes other humans

268
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,416
as if they are strange
animals in a zoo.

269
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,291
Those are rare traits
we want in our people.

270
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,916
People with
special personalities

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,083
like you and I possess.

272
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,916
Go on.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,666
I'm like you. A person
whose Crime Coefficient

274
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,708
can't be measured by
reading his Psycho-Pass.

275
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:52,166
Because of this, I spent much
of my life alone and ignored.

276
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,875
A personality that even
Sibyl's collective intelligence

277
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,666
can't measure is said to be
"criminally asymptomatic."

278
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,416
Not only are such
people incredibly rare,

279
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,625
their way of observing
represents a new value system.

280
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,416
By incorporating more of the
criminally asymptomatic into

281
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,791
its fold, Sibyl is expanding
its cognitive frontiers,

282
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,416
opening up new
areas in society

283
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,958
for the application of
collective intelligence.

284
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,708
So, what you're saying
is three years ago,

285
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,250
you weren't captured and
executed by the PSB, you were...

286
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,583
incorporated.

287
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,375
Yes. But I prefer to say

288
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,041
that I became a member
of the Sibyl System.

289
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,333
It was strange at first,

290
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,625
but I quickly came to see
and embrace its splendor.

291
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,916
It's a kind of omnipotence.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,291
By sharing my cognition
with dozens of other minds,

293
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,208
I can understand and
judge all of society.

294
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,625
I feel like a god from a
pantheon of ancient myth.

295
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,791
Everything in the
world is under my rule.

296
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
Pleasures of the
body have limits.

297
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,791
But pleasures of
the mind are infinite.

298
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:59,416
You can understand what
I'm describing can't you, Shogo?

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,375
Of course. It's not
hard to imagine.

300
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,458
Ours is a world of
maddening contradictions.

301
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,583
And it isolated and oppressed
both of us for too long.

302
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,291
But we needn't dwell on that.

303
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,791
We can be proud of the
gift fate has bestowed,

304
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,000
and the noble mission
we can accomplish.

305
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,791
The time has come.

306
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,291
To join us and put your
gifts to use judging society.

307
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,708
So you want me or
rather, my brain to

308
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,958
become the newest member
of the Sibyl System. Right?

309
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,375
Your great intelligence.

310
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,458
Your insight into human nature.

311
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,500
And of course your
asymptomatic personality

312
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,000
are all qualities we need
to further evolve the System.

313
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,625
Let me remind you this
invitation is a courtesy,

314
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,125
as we could simply make
you a member by force.

315
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,875
But "people only have real value

316
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,416
when they act on their
own impulses and desires.".

317
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,291
You said that, right?

318
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,208
That's why I was
hoping after you heard

319
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:56,250
my sales pitch you'd jump at the
opportunity to experience this.

320
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,541
Sorry, but becoming
part of some brain farm

321
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,958
collective isn't
exactly my dream.

322
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,625
Actually, joining
Sibyl shouldn't impede

323
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,208
your individualism or
independence in the slightest.

324
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,583
Even in this cyborg
body, I'm still able

325
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,916
to maintain a sense of
myself as Kouzaburou Touma,

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,083
Just say yes.

327
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,750
The operation is simple,
and relatively painless.

328
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,291
We can begin your
transfer before we even get

329
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,458
to the Ministry of Welfare with
the equipment we have on hand.

330
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,791
The mass murdering
Shogo Makishima known

331
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,708
to the public will disappear,
along with his body.

332
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,916
He will become
an omnipotent god.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,833
And the public he
once terrorized

334
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,875
will be none-the-wiser.

335
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,208
You sound like the
doctor in Balnibarbi.

336
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,333
I'm not familiar.

337
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,750
It's a reference to Gulliver's
Travels by Jonathan Swift.

338
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,375
It's in part three.

339
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,125
Balnibarbi is
where Gulliver visits

340
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,500
after the floating
island of Laputa.

341
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,583
To put an end to
partisan politics.

342
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,125
A Balnibarbian doctor develops
a surgery for politicians

343
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,416
He'll remove the brains of each
partisan and cut them in half.

344
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,625
Then, he'll sew the
halves into new brains.

345
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,875
And once placed back
in the politicians' heads,

346
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,208
they will produce "moderation,

347
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,458
as well as regularity
of thinking."

348
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,708
It's for the self-absorbed lot.

349
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,666
People who "come into
this world only to watch

350
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,250
and govern its motion."

351
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,416
Swift writes that this is

352
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,375
the most desirable
approach to government.

353
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:22,125
You're a genius
at sarcasm, Shogo.

354
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,208
That's too much credit.
The genius is Swift.

355
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,791
You probably assumed I wouldn't

356
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,208
put up a struggle until
I figured out my location.

357
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,208
But as usual, you aren't
very careful, are you?

358
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
A few minutes ago, you said,

359
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,958
"Before we even get to
the Ministry of Welfare."

360
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,500
That meant we're
currently still in transit.

361
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,333
And if we're not in the MWPSB,

362
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:11,208
then now is the perfect time
for me to make my escape.

363
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,791
Why did you refuse...?

364
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,000
Of all people, I thought you'd
welcome the joy of omnipotence

365
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,125
and the pleasure
of ruling the world.

366
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,750
Just like a god out of
ancient mythology, right?

367
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,708
I suppose that would
have its moments.

368
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,458
But I'm not high on
the idea of living out

369
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,666
my days in a jar as
one of society's umpires.

370
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,791
I want the thrill that comes

371
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,541
with actually
playing in the game.

372
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,250
How could you
think I'd join you?

373
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,416
I love this game
with all my heart.

374
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,791
And I'd like to keep playing it

375
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,500
on my terms for a while longer.

376
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,916
Please don't.

377
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,791
I didn't know you could still be

378
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,583
afraid of dying
after becoming a god.

379
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,791
Hope you don't mind
me calling so late.

380
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,875
This is Shinya Kogami's
number, right?

381
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,541
Today, I learned the true
nature of the Sibyl System.

382
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,916
If I were you, I wouldn't want

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,458
to put my life on the
line to protect it anymore.

384
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,625
Just thought you
deserved to know.

385
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,625
Well. See you around, Ko.

386
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,000
Gino! How the
hell did he escape?

387
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,375
Slow down. Who told you that?

388
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,750
Dammit, tell me what happened!

389
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,833
The PSB hasn't confirmed it yet.

390
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,791
But the transport
plane carrying Makishima.

391
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,291
It appears to have crashed.
