1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,125
I have to take you off
of this case, Kogami.

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,666
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,208
The victim's body was broken
down by a special kind of resin.

4
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,666
Forensic analysis has confirmed
the resin is an exact match

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,875
to what was used in the
Specimen case three years ago.

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,541
So after three years of silence,

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,125
our homicidal maniac
has come back to play.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,500
This man in the picture.

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,083
Do you know anything more?

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,541
Only the file
name for the image.

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,791
"Makishima."

12
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:24,291
Security here. It's gotten
rather tight, hasn't it?

13
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,666
Two students dead
one after the other.

14
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,708
Both in ways that appear
to share the same MO.

15
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,291
Of course the school
has to take action;

16
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,250
otherwise they'll face a
revolt from parents and donors.

17
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,041
Plus, the prime suspect
is Kouzaburou Touma,

18
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,666
a former teacher.

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,500
The MWPSB's investigation.

20
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,875
Will focus on
Ousou Academy for awhile.

21
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,458
So my hands are tied for now.

22
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,291
Why do you find it so necessary

23
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,625
to use students here as
the subjects for your art?

24
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,291
Because this is an
all-girl boarding school.

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,625
What are your thoughts

26
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,208
on Ousou Academy's curriculum,
Mister Makishima?

27
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,625
It's a relic but I can see how

28
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,583
some rich parents might
like its traditions. Perhaps.

29
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,125
If you're conservative-minded.

30
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,750
and you want an
old-fashioned approach

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,416
to education for your children,
this is the only school left.

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,791
Chastity and gracefulness.

33
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,583
Classic virtues that
are nearly extinct.

34
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,750
Except for here
at Ousou Academy,

35
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,791
where they're still
taught and celebrated.

36
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,333
In boys, these
virtues have no value.

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,000
Only in girls can
they be cultivated.

38
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,458
After which we can be shipped
out as replica antiques.

39
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,625
"Refined, pure maidens" for
wealthy older men to purchase

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,375
and turn into idealized partners

41
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,458
for an archaic
arrangement called, marriage.

42
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,625
Perhaps even the word "antique"
is too charitable, though.

43
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,625
Maybe it's better to describe
them as mere components.

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,875
Pieces that can be sculpted into
an artwork called, "The Lady."

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,541
They're rough stones,

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,875
waiting to be chipped
and polished into shape.

47
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,250
If given the chance, there are

48
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,250
so many ways in which
these girls could bloom.

49
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,291
And yet, their fate
is the most boring

50
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,500
and inconsequential
of all imaginable lives.

51
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,291
That's an interesting
perspective.

52
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,041
I didn't know there was so
much philosophy in your work.

53
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,833
As for this latest
piece of yours.

54
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,208
Have you decided
where you'll display it?

55
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not sure yet.

56
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
But it must be perfect.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
Out in the open.

58
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,500
Somewhere that will attract
as much attention as possible.

59
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,666
We haven't found
a solid lead yet.

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,000
Here's the case's
latest grim development.

61
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,833
Got a tip that two
sophomores never returned

62
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,708
to their dorm the other night.

63
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,083
The school went to
their parents' homes,

64
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,166
but they weren't there.

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,458
Those two might
be our next victims.

66
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,541
It's strange we
know that for sure.

67
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,875
This school's on a lockdown

68
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,583
so tight it would make
the military envious.

69
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,750
How is it even possible

70
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,500
for our guy to get a
victim out of here?

71
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,750
Let's think about this.

72
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,291
First off, why does
the killer only seem

73
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,958
to be targeting students
here at Ousou Academy?

74
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,916
Touma is probably familiar

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,875
with every square
foot of this school.

76
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,416
Maybe he knows a secret way

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,375
in through the sewers
or sub-basements.

78
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,208
Yeah that's as
good a theory as any.

79
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,291
I mean, this Academy is what?

80
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,875
A hundred-years-old?

81
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,125
How many renovations have some
of these buildings been through?

82
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,333
Just trying to understand

83
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,541
the blueprints must
make people's head spin.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,666
Maybe he's not moving in
and out with his victims.

85
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,500
Maybe his kill room or hideout

86
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,166
is somewhere on
the Academy property?

87
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,541
I knew you were
looking into this case!

88
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,125
Did Ms. Karanomori
give this to you?

89
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,208
Any thoughts?

90
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,208
I'm assuming it you've
read the same reports.

91
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,916
You want to know what I think?

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,083
Well, based on the
matching chemical,

93
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,125
I think it's looking more
likely it's the culprit

94
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,458
from the old case.

95
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,458
That's funny, my theory's
the exact opposite of yours.

96
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,666
The opposite?

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,875
Yeah.

98
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,500
For example, in the
case three years ago,

99
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,500
this guy was one of the victims.

100
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,458
Lower House member,
suspected of corruption,

101
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,708
specifically falsifying
his Crime Coefficient.

102
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,208
They gave him
the chance to get it

103
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,458
re-measured out in
the open but he refused.

104
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,791
When the media and his rivals

105
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,000
questioned him he
offered up clichéd denials.

106
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,750
Saying stuff like,
"Not to my recollection."

107
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,333
Next thing you know,
they found his body.

108
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,958
His skull sliced open
like a ripe watermelon,

109
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,416
and his brain
cleanly scooped out.

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,833
The autopsy discovered
that the killer

111
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,833
had taken the hippocampus,

112
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,708
the part of the brain
responsible for memory,

113
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,208
and shoved it up
the poor guy's ass.

114
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,500
Sasayama's death
was just as greusome.

115
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,166
But each time the killer
seemed to be sending

116
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,583
a very specific
message about the victim,

117
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,958
it was sick but literal enough
for anybody to figure it out.

118
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,541
There were four victims
during the first go around.

119
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,458
Each one found in a
completely different spot.

120
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,166
Beneath a Holographic
illumination,

121
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,958
at a five-star
restaurant, in a zoo,

122
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,583
and above a stage
for a pop concert.

123
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,708
The locations were
half the message.

124
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,041
But these two
were left in a park.

125
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,333
That's too boring
a place for him.

126
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,666
Boring?

127
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,833
These new murders lack
the ironic sense of humor

128
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,291
and clear messages
of the earlier ones.

129
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,458
They look like works of art,

130
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,791
but they're too
sterile and clinical.

131
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,958
It's like there's
something missing now.

132
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,000
And that is?

133
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,916
Originality.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,416
Originality? How so?

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,708
Like the killer wants
to be seen as profound.

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,958
But he doesn't
have anything to say.

137
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,583
At least no message
I can make sense of.

138
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,375
When Kouzaburou Touma
was killing people.

139
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,458
He was just creating materials.

140
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,208
Bodies to complete his work.

141
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,000
This killer has that in common.

142
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,250
But beyond the
unusual medium, nothing.

143
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,041
No parallels in how the
bodies are manipulated.

144
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,750
I get a totally different
vibe from this killer.

145
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,708
The crime scenes
show he's intelligent

146
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,875
and got assigned a well-paying
job thanks to Sibyl's Judgment.

147
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,541
But he's also young,
or at least immature

148
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,333
and childlike at times.

149
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,166
Considering none of
the victim's bodies

150
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,833
showed signs of sexual abuse,
we can guess that our killer

151
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,208
himself never suffered
any as a child.

152
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,750
It kinda sounds like you're.

153
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,375
Profiling.

154
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,500
Inspector, I'd like permission
to go out in the field.

155
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,500
What? You can't leave here
without me chaperoning.

156
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,458
Alright, then I'm
inviting you to chaperone.

157
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,416
This place?

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,250
Is this your first time?

159
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,916
Actually, I guess you never
had any reason to visit.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,083
You know, once you

161
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,791
or Gino decides I've
worn out my welcome.

162
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,208
I'll be thrown in here

163
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,250
and never allowed in
the outside world again.

164
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, but why are
we here right now?

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,208
I've got a hunch
the way the bodies

166
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,750
are arranged in our current case

167
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,083
is actually based
on some artwork.

168
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,583
So, I thought we'd get a
real expert's opinion on it.

169
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,208
We're entering the ward

170
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,416
where they isolate patients

171
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,583
with Crime Coefficients
over three hundred.

172
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,708
In case of emergency,

173
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,041
the vents'll flood
the room with toxic gas.

174
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,666
Basically, you're walking

175
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,583
through a part-time
execution chamber.

176
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,875
That's brutal.

177
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,208
Even if these guys could leave,
they wouldn't last a second.

178
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,875
The Dominators would immediately

179
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,041
give an execution order
and turn them into pink slush.

180
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
But, by spending
their lives in a cage,

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,208
at least they get to live.

182
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,166
Hi, Doggie!
It's been awhile hasn't it?

183
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,041
You've been busy with your art.

184
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,791
Getting them on your
back must've been hard.

185
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,750
I assure you,
my body is quite flexible.

186
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,166
I can get it onto my back,
as long as I have a mirror.

187
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,916
You see the news?

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,666
If the world does not
show an appreciation for art.

189
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,958
I won't appreciate it.

190
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,291
I'm looking for pieces
similar to these bodies.

191
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,541
Paintings, sculptures,
illustrations.

192
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,083
Even stuff like movies,
games or comics.

193
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,250
These are good.

194
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,333
They're exactly like
Roichi Oryo's work.

195
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,291
Ever heard of him?

196
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,125
No.

197
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,625
Aw. It's so sad that a talent

198
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,208
as great as his
has been forgotten.

199
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,666
In my day, any art the
government deemed "obscene,"

200
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,541
still ended up squirreled away

201
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,875
by hackers into the
recesses of the Net.

202
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,750
Kids today lack guts.

203
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,083
You realize, don't you.

204
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,500
Today hackers would
be in here, too.

205
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,625
All thanks to the Sibyl System.

206
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,500
You're a cold bastard,
Ko. Look .

207
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,500
Similar, isn't it?

208
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,000
When I had a gallery,

209
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,041
I often sold his pieces
for tens of thousands.

210
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,958
Because not only were
they obscenely original,

211
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,833
but the product
of a coherent voice

212
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,291
who infused them
with fundamental themes.

213
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,875
Thank you for your time.

214
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,583
Let's check the investigation
materials again.

215
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,958
Maybe there's a reference to
this Rouichi Ouryou we missed?

216
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,125
Okay, hold on.

217
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,916
There's a student at Ousou
Academy with the same last name.

218
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,250
Kogami. It's the guy's daughter!

219
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,500
Seen any suspicious
men around campus?

220
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,458
No.

221
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,875
All right. Thank you, Miss.

222
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,958
Hey, Ko!

223
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,125
That idiot.

224
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,208
Wait! We think a girl
here's the killer!

225
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,583
What?

226
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,625
Hey, officer, you can't
just march into the Academy!

227
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,708
Your boss told us
you'd be delicate

228
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,916
with this investigation!

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,916
The students are
already on edge as it is!

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,041
You have to turn around!

231
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,916
Are you Rikako Ouryou?

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,916
And what is this about?

233
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,166
Crime Coefficient:
Four Hundred Seventy-Two.

234
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,541
Enforcement Mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

235
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,041
Aim carefully
and eliminate target.

236
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,333
No, you can't!

237
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,458
No, stop!

238
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,666
Hey--What the hell's
wrong with you guys!

239
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,500
She's only a teenager!

240
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,750
Hate to tell ya, It's been years
since we've had juvenile law.

241
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,958
That was a little too close.

242
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,500
Thank you for your help.

243
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,708
Did Mr. Makishima
tell you to be here?

244
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,625
Yes.

245
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,250
I want a perimeter
around the Academy!

246
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,541
Use every drone we've got!

247
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,583
We don't have enough?

248
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,708
Well, scrounge some up, dammit!

249
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,125
That's Kagami!

250
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,083
Will one of you please explain

251
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,000
to me how we can't
find a teenage girl!

252
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,166
Security is geared
toward monitoring people

253
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,750
coming in and
out of the Academy.

254
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,250
Finding a person already hiding
inside is much trickier, sir.

255
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,708
If you were to analyze all
security camera recordings

256
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,083
from the last few
days would you be able

257
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,791
to quickly isolate
Rikako Ouryou?

258
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,375
As long as I get help from
the lab at Headquarters.

259
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,750
It shouldn't take me more
than fifteen minutes or so.

260
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,583
Then get started.

261
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,041
So. You said, "Rouichi Ouryou".

262
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,625
How'd you track down our
killer from this obscure artist?

263
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,541
You were looking for
originality. Right, Kogami?

264
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,958
Originality?

265
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,750
Yes, sir.
See, well, our killer...

266
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,458
Her message struck
Mr. Kogami as boring,

267
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,125
so he thought
to use... y'know...

268
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,250
profiling to find
a lead, or sort of.

269
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,750
Kogami. How long have you
known these two murders

270
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,833
were not committed
by Kouzaburou Touma?

271
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,875
Was it from the start
of our investigation?

272
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,083
The killer we're after now
displays her victims in places

273
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,666
where she's certain they'll
attract the most attention.

274
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,208
But if it were Kouzaburou
Touma on the other hand.

275
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,875
He'd never use an ordinary
park twice in a row.

276
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,208
Your profile aside.

277
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,625
We still lack hard proof
the killer's Rikako.

278
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,583
That may be but we
can't have a person

279
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,833
with a high Crime Coefficient
out walking the streets, either.

280
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,625
Right, sir?

281
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,500
All the recordings
are downloaded now.

282
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,500
I'll put them on the wall.

283
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,458
She looks pretty popular
for a murderer.

284
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,375
It's almost like she's
got her own fan club.

285
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,125
Where's this camera looking?

286
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,583
The garbage disposal
facility behind the dorms.

287
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,125
What the hell's she doing there?

288
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,250
Kogami. How long have you known

289
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,458
these two murders were not
committed by Kouzaburou Touma?

290
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,708
Was it from the start
of our investigation?

291
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,958
The killer we're after now
displays her victims in places

292
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,500
where she's certain they'll
attract the most attention.

293
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,291
I didn't know you were a
music fan, Mister Shibata.

294
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,583
Yes. I'm always looking

295
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,041
for promising young
talent to mentor.

296
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,583
There's no better feeling

297
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,375
than finding them an
audience for their work.

298
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,958
Help! Vice Principal!

299
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,416
The police just found two more
bodies on the Academy grounds!

300
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,541
Oh no, not again.

301
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,666
You must've been
very close to her.

302
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
How did you know?

303
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,208
It's the look in your eyes.

304
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,875
There was something
important I never

305
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
worked up the courage
to tell Kagami.

306
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,041
She'd been so
worried for Yoshika.

307
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,583
All she cared
about was finding out

308
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,916
what happened
to her best friend.

309
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,166
I was the one who
told her to ask Rikako.

310
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,125
If I could go back,
I'd never let her go alone!

311
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,208
I'm responsible.

312
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,541
It's like I'm the
one who murdered her.

313
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,541
If I hadn't said that
she'd still be alive!

314
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,208
Get all your crying out now.

315
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,625
Before you become unstable
and your Hue clouds up. Kay.

316
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,958
We still have too many
unanswered questions.

317
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,291
The escape route that
was used by Rikako.

318
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,625
The stuff down in the basement.

319
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,125
No matter how smart she may be,

320
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,958
these aren't things a high
schooler can manage on her own.

321
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,375
I think there's
someone helping her.

322
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,250
What if, like you said, she--

323
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,166
Wait.

324
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,416
What's wrong?

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,250
Some of the data is damaged.

326
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,708
When Kunizuka
first downloaded all

327
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,291
of it everything was
in pristine shape.

328
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,125
It looks like all the
damage has been done

329
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,250
to the feed from
the art room camera.

330
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,666
It's unwatchable.

331
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,041
Hold on. This one. I think
we can restore the audio.

332
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,958
Why do you find it so necessary

333
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,791
to use students here as
the subjects for your art?

334
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,458
Because this is an
all-girl boarding school.

335
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,208
What are your thoughts

336
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,958
on Ousou Academy's curriculum,
Mister Makishima?

337
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,625
Are you sure this
is the right way?

338
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,375
Choe Gu-Sung?

339
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
Rikako Ouryou.

340
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,000
There's something I need to
know before this is all over.

341
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,541
Do you realize what
you've done wrong?

342
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
What you've done
to disappoint me.

343
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,083
Your dear mentor?

344
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,958
What? What on Earth
are you talking about?

345
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,458
I didn't do anything wrong.

346
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,166
Hm. Well, if you don't realize

347
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,416
what you've done wrong,
you certainly can't discuss it.

348
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,083
My fears have sadly come true.

349
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,041
Your growth has stunted.

350
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,666
It's so depressing.

351
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,125
When I first met you, I thought,

352
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,000
"Here's a smart girl with
great things in her future."

353
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,416
Wait, please! Mister Makishima!

354
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,625
If you're mad at me, I'm sorry!

355
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:34,125
I like this quote
from Titus Andronicus.

356
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,125
"And So should I rob
my sweet sons of their fee?

357
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,708
No Let them satisfy
their lust. On thee."

358
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,416
What is this?

359
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,250
"The Hunt is up.

360
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,416
The morning is bright and gray.

361
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,166
The fields are fragrant
and the woods are green.

362
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,666
Uncouple here.

363
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,083
And let us make a bay."

364
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,125
"They told me, here,
at dead time of night.

365
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,583
A thousand fiends,
a thousand hissing snakes,

366
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:11,333
ten thousand swelling toads,
as many urchins.

367
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,500
"Would make such
fearful and confused cries."

368
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,208
"Listen, fair madam.

369
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,958
Let it be your glory to see
her tears, but be your heart

370
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,375
to them as unrelenting
flint to drops of rain."

371
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,791
"And so now go tell.

372
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,041
An' if thy tongue of
yours can speak it,

373
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:08,791
who 'twas that cut thy
tongue and ravish-ed thee.

374
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,625
Write down thy mind,
bewray thy meaning so.

375
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,208
An' if thy stumps will
let thee play the scribe."

376
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,166
He'll kill you.

377
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,875
One day, Mister Makishima
will get bored

378
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,583
and toss you away like me.

379
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,541
Don't you worry about that.

380
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,625
In the end,
you were nothing more

381
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,666
than a little pet
for him to play with.

382
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,166
and, like Mister Makishima,

383
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,958
I did appreciate
the fun you provided.

384
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,208
"Her life was beast-like,
and devoid of pity.

385
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,125
And being so,
shall have like want of pity."

386
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,333
A most fitting end for Rikako,
courtesy of Titus Andronicus.

387
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,583
Was it fitting, though?

388
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,416
Until tonight, I was under
the impression you liked Rikako.

389
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,458
Yes. But I've found
a more interesting toy.

390
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,291
I need you to get
some information.

391
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,875
The man from the
MWPSB who came to school.

392
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:16,166
He is an Enforcer.
I believe his name's Kogami.

393
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,833
An Enforcer.

394
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,000
That's a strange choice
to set your sights on.

395
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,375
He is.

396
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,291
But the man's instincts
and intelligence.

397
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,125
Are extremely impressive.

398
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,083
I think Kogami should
prove quite entertaining.
