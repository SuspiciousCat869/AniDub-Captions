1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,958
Shepherd Two,
you're moving too fast.

2
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,583
What is your current location?

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,541
I can't find Hound
Four, Sasayama.

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,666
What's going on? Where
could he have gone off to?

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,125
Calm down, Kogami.

6
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,791
Things are getting out of
control. Come back for now.

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,833
I'm bringing Sasayama back!

8
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,250
Sasayama...?

9
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,958
Looks like she's working hard.

10
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,833
Due to her inexperience.

11
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,500
she acts unprofessionally
a little too often.

12
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,083
But she's still an
excellent employee.

13
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,041
I think she has a bright future.

14
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,666
Well, I certainly
hope that's true.

15
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,333
Of course, there's always a
chance she could wind up

16
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,666
going down the path
of your former partner.

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,875
Started same year as you.

18
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,541
Yes. Chief.

19
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,375
You Inspectors have
very demanding jobs.

20
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,416
Even as you face the
deviant and distorted minds

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,416
of all of those criminals
and Enforcers out there.

22
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,625
You must maintain the
unyielding spirit needed

23
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,416
to pursue your duties.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,791
You should be sure to
keep your guard up, too.

25
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,208
Ginoza. A causal
relationship between genes

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,375
and Crime Coefficients
as of yet

27
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,791
still hasn't been
scientifically proven.

28
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,666
Though just to be clear,

29
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,791
that also means that it hasn't
been disproven yet either.

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,250
I hope that you don't make the
same mistake as your father.

31
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,291
I hope it with every
beat of my heart.

32
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll keep that in mind.

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,750
"A blank, my lord.

34
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
She never told her love,

35
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,958
But let concealment,
like a worm in the bud,

36
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,541
Feed on her damask cheek:
she pined in thought,

37
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,708
And with a green
and yellow melancholy

38
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,166
She sat like patience
on a monument,

39
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,625
Smiling at grief.

40
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,416
Was not this love indeed?

41
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,916
We men may say
more, swear more: but indeed

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
Our shows are more than will;
for still we prove

43
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,416
Much in our vows,
but little in our love."

44
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Stop there.

45
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,208
Yes.

46
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,625
The first known performance
of Twelfth Night took place in

47
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,625
sixteen oh two, yet in
the verse Kagami just read,

48
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,791
you get a glimpse of the

49
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,958
enduring universality
of Shakespeare.

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,750
Are you in literature
class right now?

51
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,583
Yes. We're studying Twelfth
Night by Shakespeare.

52
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,875
Shakespeare's
comedies are boring.

53
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,791
You don't like his work?

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,041
I do like his tragedies.

55
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,750
Especially Macbeth
and Titus Andronicus.

56
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,208
So those two are the
interesting ones, huh?

57
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:39,375
Not only are they interesting,
but they're especially cruel.

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,500
Okay, but why don't you just
look it up in the database?

59
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,458
As an Inspector,
you're authorized.

60
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,250
Yeah, but if I
access those files,

61
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,958
Mister Kogami will find out.

62
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,875
Is it that you don't
want him to know?

63
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,833
Or is it that you're seriously
concerned about Kogami?

64
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,916
Are you in love?

65
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,041
So. Have you ever been in love?

66
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,750
Let me put it like this, Akane.

67
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,166
I'm way more experienced
in life than you.

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,375
And not just when
it comes to love.

69
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,666
I've done all
kinds of bad things.

70
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,375
I've ventured into a world so
depraved that a wholesome girl

71
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,916
like you wouldn't even
be able to imagine it.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,958
Really?

73
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,875
For instance, this...

74
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,166
You mean juice?

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,791
Not juice! It's booze!
Real alcohol!

76
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,666
Ol' Masaoka gave some to me.

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,041
These days, people are afraid
of getting addicted to it.

78
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,250
So they stick to safe
therapeutic tripping

79
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,750
or go virtual, you know.

80
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,041
That's for drinking?
Not for breathing fire?

81
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,416
Never mind.

82
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,791
Well, this is the
kind of naughty fun

83
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,166
that is now our privilege,

84
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,708
and dare I say it,
our duty to enjoy.

85
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,166
I see. Whoa, that's good!

86
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,458
Of course it is,
this is real cooking.

87
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,750
Hey, those snacks are only
for people who are drinking!

88
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,958
No fair.

89
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,541
You're more than welcome
to try some, though.

90
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,166
If you get me drunk,

91
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,583
I may start talkin'
'bout all sorts of things.

92
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, see, the thing is
by the time I came along

93
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,833
and joined the unit,
Ko had already been

94
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,708
stripped of his Inspector title.

95
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,041
So I don't really
know all the details

96
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,708
but what I heard is that it had
something to do with an Enforcer

97
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,958
who was under his command
at the time getting killed.

98
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,166
How was he killed?

99
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,958
Well, he was chasing
down a suspect,

100
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,750
but the tables turned
and he became a victim.

101
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:50,125
If I'm remembering right,
his name was Sasayama.

102
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,666
He was killed same way
as the other victims.

103
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,916
From what I hear,
it was all pretty gruesome.

104
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,875
The whole thing
really messed Ko up bad

105
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,708
and caused his Crime
Coefficient to shoot up.

106
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,416
The case may never
have been solved,

107
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
but Ko refuses to give up on it.

108
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,833
The stubborn guy is still
investigating it to this day.

109
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,791
That sounds awful.

110
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,333
Now tell me.

111
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:17,125
How is it you're okay
after drinking so much?

112
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,416
Well, maybe you just
get drunk way too easily.

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,083
Enforcer Sasayama?

114
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,916
Oh. There's no
way I could forget

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,208
the Specimen Case,
even if I tried.

116
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,750
"Specimen Case?"

117
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,041
Yeah, that was how we all
referred to the investigation.

118
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,375
Akane, you've
heard of plastination?

119
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,500
It's a process they use

120
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,625
to create biological
specimens, right?

121
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,291
Yeah. It's a technique
for preserving tissue.

122
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,833
Water and fat are
replaced by polymers.

123
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,625
But in the Specimen Case,
it was used to commit murder.

124
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,416
First the killer dismembered
and cleaved open the body,

125
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,625
then used plastination to
turn it into a human specimen.

126
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,916
They brought their handiwork
right into the middle of town,

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,708
and displayed it under

128
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,041
a Holographic illumination in
the entertainment district.

129
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,333
So wrong.

130
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,041
Thousands of
passersby thought they

131
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,000
were just looking
at ordinary environment Holo.

132
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,250
But the truth was, they
were walking right past

133
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,708
the mutilated cadaver
hiding underneath it.

134
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,083
When people found that out,

135
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,875
the Area Stress
jumped up four levels.

136
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,875
It was so bad, they
imposed a news blackout.

137
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,625
Sorry. We shouldn't discuss
this while you're eating.

138
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,916
Why not?

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,375
It takes a lot to
ruin Yayoi's appetite.

140
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,708
Believe me, that girl
is into some stuff

141
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,791
way more sick and
twisted than this.

142
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,250
Uh, that's...

143
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,083
You were talking about the
Specimen Case, right? Continue.

144
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, you see.

145
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,708
Since the procedures were
obviously performed by an expert

146
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,000
the investigation was focused
almost entirely on specialists

147
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,958
in the fields of
pharmacy and chemistry.

148
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,750
But then, in the midst
of all this, Sasayama was.

149
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,500
While looking into a
totally unrelated report

150
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,541
of a missing high school
teacher, they were searching

151
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,416
the guy's apartment and they
came across plastination resin.

152
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,750
It was this guy. Kozaburo Toma.

153
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,541
As soon as he went missing, the
killings came to an abrupt stop.

154
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,750
So it seemed clear he
must've been the culprit.

155
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,458
But all we had was
circumstantial evidence

156
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,875
so it ended up an unsolved case.

157
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,291
On top of that,
Toma didn't have any kind

158
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,000
of background in chemistry,
so even the question of

159
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,750
who created the resin he
used remains a mystery.

160
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,416
You're saying he
had an accomplice?

161
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I don't think we can call
this person an accomplice

162
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,500
since we just have no
way of knowing whether

163
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,541
he had the slightest clue

164
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,416
of what the resin he was
making would be used for.

165
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,875
Hell, we don't even
know how it was acquired

166
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,583
at this point. Only God
knows for sure. I'd say.

167
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,375
I take it you're having
a rough day, as usual.

168
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,791
You can tell?

169
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,958
Considering how crappy you look,
it'd be pretty hard not to.

170
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,208
Guess being on the
fast track gets bumpy.

171
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,000
Keeping all those secrets.

172
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,625
Yeah exactly. It sucks.

173
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,250
So, does this have
something to do

174
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,750
with that loose
cannon you work with?

175
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,458
I feel like I just can't
get a read on him, you know?

176
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,458
And then, to make things
even more confusing,

177
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,791
I just found out
he used to have my job.

178
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,000
Wait, don't tell me
this dude used to

179
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,041
be some kind of
honor student, too.

180
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,458
Did everybody but me and
Yuki score a seven hundred?

181
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,916
He's like, super-smart!

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,125
This is just a thought.

183
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah?

184
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,916
But could it be, the problem.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,416
is that you two
are too much alike?

186
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,125
Sorry, it's urgent! I gotta go!

187
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,625
Hey, you can't leave!
We just got here!

188
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,791
I'll make it up
to you next time!

189
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,833
It looks like Satsuki
Kuzuhara is still missing.

190
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,416
She just vanished.

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,833
I heard the teachers
were ordered

192
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,416
to keep silent about her.

193
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,375
They're afraid if they discuss
it then the students will worry.

194
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,541
Don't they know.

195
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,958
That makes us worry even more?

196
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,250
The chief selling point of this
school is that they keep girls

197
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,500
of a susceptible age isolated
from society, locked away

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,916
in this conservatory
environment,

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
to prevent our Psycho-Passes
from getting cloudy.

200
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,000
That's why they sweep all
the problems under the rug.

201
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,625
And besides, they have to keep
up appearances for our parents.

202
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,416
Oh no. I'm scared!

203
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,750
If you think that's bad,
listen to this rumor.

204
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,333
Apparently, one of the teachers

205
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,375
who taught here a
few years ago. He was...

206
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,625
Miss Ouryou!

207
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,250
It's Rikako!

208
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,041
I can't figure it out. Why the
hell is Rikako so popular?

209
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,541
She's pretty and
she's intelligent.

210
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,750
Do you really need me to go on?

211
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,416
Yeah, well something
about that girl scares me.

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,750
Why's that?

213
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,875
Her eyes can be
so blank sometimes.

214
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,416
It's as if they're staring far
off into another dimension.

215
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,083
Kawarazaki. Shimotsuki.

216
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, hey.

217
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,375
Yes, good afternoon.

218
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,333
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch, girls.

219
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,125
What brings you?

220
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,666
Well, neither of
you ladies belongs

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,291
to any extracurricular
clubs, am I right?

222
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
These days, having a school
that offers club activities,

223
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,291
like Ousou Academy does,
is pretty uncommon.

224
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,125
Really, it's a rare luxury.

225
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,208
It's a shame to
miss out on that.

226
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,625
Are you recruiting us?

227
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,583
You got me. You see,

228
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,208
I'm the president
of the art club here.

229
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,416
If you're interested,
come see us in our clubroom.

230
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,791
Oh, and Shimotsuki.

231
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,125
I may get a little
lost in thought sometimes

232
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,750
but I can't see
into other dimensions.

233
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,125
I mean, I'm not an alien.

234
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,000
Way to go. She heard.

235
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,666
Sorry.

236
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,833
Excuse me.

237
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,583
Thanks for coming.

238
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,583
I know about your
step-father, Yoshika.

239
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,500
Your mother's new husband.

240
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,791
You're interested in my life?

241
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,333
Yeah. Of course,
I've been watching you

242
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,625
for a while now, you know.

243
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,750
Miss Ouryou.

244
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:53,416
Tell me what happened
in your own words.

245
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,375
That man he's
always looking at me

246
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,916
with these disturbing, almost
just like predatory eyes.

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Every time I go home.

248
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:08,000
I find traces that
someone's been in my room.

249
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,250
I just can't take it! But...

250
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,750
But there's no way you can
talk to your mother about it.

251
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,000
My real father left
behind so much debt

252
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,875
that it'd be impossible for my
mom to pay it off on her own.

253
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,875
So we have to
depend on that man.

254
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,750
But at my regular
checkup last week,

255
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,541
they said my Psycho-Pass
had gotten all cloudy.

256
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,500
As it is I might...

257
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,625
Yoshika.

258
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,833
It feels like you're not allowed

259
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,125
to choose the life you
wish you could live.

260
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,833
I understand how hard that is.

261
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,708
In this day and age the
System determines our aptitudes

262
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,875
and we have no choice but to
live by that and be satisfied

263
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,916
with just whatever happiness
is forced upon us,

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,375
unable and unpermitted

265
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,541
to make any of our
real dreams a reality.

266
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,791
The person that you long to be.

267
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,875
Your true worth in this world.

268
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,875
Don't you want to at least
try to discover that?

269
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,291
I can show you, Yoshika.

270
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,625
The beauty that's hiding inside
you, just below the surface.

271
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,333
Would you like to hear some
more about Shakespeare's work?

272
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,583
Please.

273
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,041
Let's start with
Titus Andronicus.

274
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,541
My favorite character in that
one is Titus' daughter, Lavinia.

275
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,041
She was punished for
the sins of her father.

276
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,416
His enemies raped her, and then,
so she couldn't tell anyone.

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,208
they cut out her tongue
and chopped off her arms.

278
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,916
"and he that wounded her Hath

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
hurt me more than
had he killed me dead".

280
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,625
Poor Lavinia. In the end,

281
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,708
put to death at the
hand of her own father.

282
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,875
There are millions of things.

283
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,708
that we humans are capable
of but animals are not.

284
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,750
One of those things
is safety control.

285
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,500
No matter what we create,

286
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,666
humans always put a
safety mechanism on it.

287
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,166
Enforcers are equipped
with a safety mechanism

288
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,041
in the form of Inspectors.

289
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,166
And the Drones you
controlled were furnished

290
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,833
with their own set of
rigorous security measures.

291
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,500
Those Drones were supposed
to be absolutely safe,

292
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,625
and yet, this memory
card made them kill people.

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,291
Where did you obtain it?

294
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,041
The safety override
program that Kanehara put

295
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,083
to use in the
Hachioji Drone incident

296
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,416
and then Mido's
Holograph cracking.

297
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, in both of those
instances I was only able

298
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,708
to recover a small
fragment of the source code.

299
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,625
but there are
clear similarities.

300
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,500
I think the same programmer
wrote code for both.

301
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,875
Hell, I'm so sure of that, I'd
bet the bra I'm wearing on it.

302
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,416
Keep it please.

303
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,458
Mido may have been overly
obsessed with social networks.

304
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,625
but he didn't possess
the skills necessary

305
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,541
to tamper with public
Holo to that degree.

306
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,125
There's no mistaking the
fact that Kanehara and Mido

307
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,000
were both being backed by a
professional cyber-criminal.

308
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,333
Yeah, but this testimony

309
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,625
from Kanehara isn't gonna
help us any, is it, now?

310
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,833
I swear!

311
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,375
It was just sent to me
in the mail one day,

312
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,708
clear out of the blue!

313
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,125
The letter wasn't signed;
there was no name on it.

314
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,250
All it said was he had a
grudge against the factory

315
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,625
so he wanted us
to destroy it together!

316
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,041
Pretty vicious.

317
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,041
Seems this person
will kill for kicks.

318
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,875
How could whoever sent
that letter have predicted

319
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,500
that Kanehara would be open
to killing in the first place?

320
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,375
Why not?

321
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,708
Pops had Kanehara figured out

322
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,583
just by looking at the
staff's periodic checkups.

323
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,000
Surely someone else could've
done the same thing.

324
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,375
It's not like those evaluation
files were kept confidential.

325
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,083
So what's this guy's
motive for helping Mido?

326
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,916
It was Kanehara and
Mido who had the motives.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,708
And that would be more than
enough of a reason for him.

328
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,458
Kogami?

329
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,416
Intent and means.

330
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,458
Engineering a crime
by bringing together

331
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,791
those two otherwise
disparate elements.

332
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,166
That's how he plays his game.

333
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,166
Hey!

334
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
Kogami you can't keep...

335
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,708
Gino, it's the
same as that case.

336
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,666
Someone out there is
providing the means to people

337
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,500
who have the desire to kill,
but don't know how.

338
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,791
Turning these wannabes
into actual murderers.

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,458
Stop and think this through.

340
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,250
Back then they used a resin.

341
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,958
But this time, it was a
tool for cracking programs.

342
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,958
There's no connection.

343
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,041
The engineer and the middleman
are two different people!

344
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,375
There's somebody who
brings them together.

345
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,791
Those who wish to kill and those

346
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,541
who can create the weapons
they need to pull it off.

347
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,375
That's the real mastermind.

348
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,916
Enough of this!

349
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,416
You've been chasing
a damn ghost!

350
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,458
One that may never have existed!

351
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,125
Sasayama was on the
verge of a breakthrough.

352
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,083
I'll settle this score for him.

353
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,416
That's what I've been working
towards for three years.

354
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,125
It's Takahashi from
Public Cleaning Bureau.

355
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,250
Yeah, I'm over at the
Central Fountain Tower.

356
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,333
Noise has been in the
Hologram for a while.

357
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,583
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,166
You mind turning off
the fountain Holo

359
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
so we can check it out?

360
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,291
What the hell?

361
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,375
Whoa that's creepy!
Is it a doll?

362
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,916
Looks like some kinda art
project or something.

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,958
Huh, maybe.

364
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,250
Whatever it is,
it's in poor taste.

365
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,333
It's gross. Who did this?

366
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:21,333
Y'know, when you get up close,
it looks pretty damn real.

367
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,708
Such detail.

368
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,708
Still. I don't
think I'd want that

369
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,291
on display anywhere in my house.

370
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,166
I'm curious. Do you think
Lavinia was happy at last?

371
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,500
Finally liberated from her
violated body?

372
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,333
It's like Saturninus
says in Act Five,

373
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,791
just before Titus kills her.

374
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,000
"Because the girl should
not survive her shame,

375
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,708
And by her presence
still renew his sorrows.".

376
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,125
Is that right. Mister Makishima?

377
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,083
Even beautiful flowers
eventually wither and fall.

378
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,750
It's a fate that
meets all living things,

379
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,333
one way or another.

380
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,875
Knowing that sad fact, it's only
natural to want to stop time,

381
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,208
preserving the blossom
while still in full bloom.

382
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,041
But if you did truly
love the girl as though

383
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
she were your own daughter,

384
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,458
do you believe that you,
too, will be moved to say.

385
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,125
"Kill'd her for whom my tears

386
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,458
have made me blind."
as Titus was?

387
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,750
Oh, that might be
a problem for me

388
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,125
because I have many
more works of art

389
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,833
that I wish to complete
in the days that lie ahead.

390
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,333
I'm just getting started.
