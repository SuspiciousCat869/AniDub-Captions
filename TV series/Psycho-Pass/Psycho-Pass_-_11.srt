1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,750
Inspector Tsunemori,
take Masaoka

2
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,333
into those tunnels
and find Kogami.

3
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,083
Let us know when you do.

4
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,500
The rest of us
will search the area

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,166
for the source of that
jamming signal and destroy it.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,166
Careful out there.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,375
Yes sir.

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,750
To be honest. I have no
idea what's going on.

9
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,791
The powerful jamming.
This unmapped underground.

10
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,625
And a call for
backup from Kogami.

11
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,083
Well we know one
thing: it's serious.

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,750
Yes, it would seem so.

13
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,541
I've never heard Ko like that.

14
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,250
He really sounded desperate.

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,291
There's something bad down here.

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,166
I don't care much for
games of hide and seek.

17
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,125
They want to spoil my fun.

18
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,791
This must be it.

19
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,500
Take that!

20
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,541
User authentication,
Enforcer Shinya Kogami.

21
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,208
You are a valid user.

22
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,583
The Target's Threat Judgment
has been reappraised.

23
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,750
Enforcement mode:
Destroy Decomposer.

24
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,083
Target will be
completely annihilated.

25
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,125
Please proceed
with maximum caution.

26
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,541
Aim carefully and
eliminate the target.

27
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,208
There's a pattern.

28
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,166
Silence after every two shots.

29
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,166
This guy must be using a
double-barreled hunting gun.

30
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
I've got bad news

31
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,708
Your time is up.

32
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,333
Seems they've destroyed
the jamming device.

33
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,625
According to protocol,

34
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,916
the main unit of the
MWPSB is about to rush in.

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,166
Lovecraft was
just blown to hell.

36
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,916
That bastard enforcer
destroyed it.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,125
He finally got his nerve
and started to fight.

38
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,625
What will you do now?

39
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,041
When I was young I spent a
long time working construction

40
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,416
in developing countries,
mostly infrastructure.

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,333
The more dangerous the place,
the more the job would pay.

42
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,333
Conflict would
come out of nowhere,

43
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,375
and there was no way to
predict the next danger,

44
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,708
or limit the risk.

45
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,791
I remember our people
getting ambushed

46
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,583
once by guerilla troops.

47
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,416
That must've been seventy
or eighty years ago.

48
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,791
It was gruesome.

49
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,916
The colleague next to me
was shot with an incendiary.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,625
He was a good friend, and
one minute he was shouting

51
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,583
and crying out in horror, and
then the next he was nothing

52
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,791
but a disgusting lump of
flesh melting in the seat.

53
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,208
His blood splattered
and dripped down my head,

54
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,583
and the smell of
his remains-- my god.

55
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,666
It stuck to me, stayed with me

56
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,916
no matter how I tried
to get rid of it.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,875
I don't want you to get the
wrong idea when I say this,

58
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,583
but for me that's a
memory that I cherish.

59
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,833
That moment I felt awake, alive.

60
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,500
It was an indescribable
intensity

61
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,916
of existence I've never equaled
for the rest of my life.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,125
But after all this time

63
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,791
I'm finally feeling
that intensity again.

64
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,041
My heart may now be mechanical,

65
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,083
but my blood burns in
a way I had forgotten.

66
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,041
And you're suggesting I run?

67
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,750
Not even you could
be that cruel of a man.

68
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,958
From here on, it won't
be a game anymore.

69
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,750
That's exactly right.

70
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,958
As an avid hunter,

71
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,958
I've shot down countless
prey over the years.

72
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,125
But now I want to
confront that Enforcer

73
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,750
as a duelist man to man.

74
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,250
Tell me the truth, Makishima.

75
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,000
Surely you didn't
invest all this time in me

76
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,166
because you thought I would
turn tail now, did you?

77
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,666
That wouldn't be
interesting to you at all.

78
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,458
Clearly you know me too well.

79
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,208
I'll witness the
splendor of your life

80
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,958
all the way until you
draw your last breath.

81
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,916
It'll be checkmate for you
soon enough, Enforcer hound.

82
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,500
Crime Coefficient, 328.
Enforcement action required.

83
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,833
Amazing. We did it!

84
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,458
We really beat that monster!

85
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,875
I'm sorry for putting
you at so much risk

86
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,125
Once we're out of this place

87
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,208
get therapy treatment
as soon as you can.

88
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,625
You saw way too many
things you shouldn't have.

89
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,875
I'm just sorry I couldn't
shield you from that.

90
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,875
That's okay.
Don't blame yourself.

91
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
You've been wonderful.

92
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,833
If you're what latent
criminals are like,

93
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,000
I wouldn't mind
being one myself.

94
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,416
Don't be stupid.

95
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,583
Stop it! Let me go!

96
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,000
I would love to
stay here with you

97
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,666
and talk the
whole night through,

98
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,083
but you don't seem to be
in proper shape for that

99
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,541
I'll see you again soon.

100
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,958
Stop! Mr. Kogami!

101
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,541
Don't let your guard down.

102
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,125
Calling this dangerous would
be an understatement.

103
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,666
There's bullet holes everywhere.

104
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,875
Must be a shotgun.

105
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,583
I think it's been years

106
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,041
since I've seen the
traces of actual gunpowder.

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,541
Do you see this blood?

108
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,125
Where are you Kogami

109
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,958
Someone help!

110
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,333
Yuki!

111
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,500
Do you know that voice?

112
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,083
It sounds like my
friend who went missing.

113
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,666
Please we have to
find her, let's go!

114
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
That's Kogami!

115
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,333
Kogami!

116
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,208
He's in bad shape.

117
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,916
Looks like multiple bullet
wounds from close range.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,041
First aid.
Think you can you do it?

119
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,208
I've had my training sessions,

120
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,958
but I've never actually
done it for real.

121
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,083
Then you'll have
to leave it to me.

122
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,791
Akane.

123
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,791
There's a second man here.

124
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,958
He handcuffed your friend
and went that direction.

125
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,416
Try to stay out of the way.

126
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,791
I can at least
stop his bleeding.

127
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,166
Where the hell are
you going? Inspector!

128
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,416
This case isn't over yet!

129
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,125
Shit!

130
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,166
It's like a battlefield,

131
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,291
no, an execution ground.

132
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,625
Look at all this blood.

133
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,083
It couldn't have been
just three or four people.

134
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,958
I'd say several dozen, at least.

135
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,750
For all we know, a hundred
people could've died down here.

136
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,125
It seems Kogami was
lured into this place.

137
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,666
So many massacred.
And to what end?

138
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,541
What did the killer do this for?

139
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,375
Some kind of a game, maybe?

140
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,291
What?

141
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,791
I don't know.

142
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,333
It's just a feeling I've had
ever since we got down here.

143
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,166
This place looks like
the kind of battle arena

144
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
you'd see in a
fighting game online.

145
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,500
I could understand
if it were virtual,

146
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,541
but who would play a game
using live human beings?

147
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,125
This is Hound One.
Can anyone hear me?

148
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,833
This is Shepherd One.
What's your status?

149
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,708
I'm tending to Hound Three.

150
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,375
He's hurt so bad I'm
surprised he's still ticking.

151
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,416
A culprit is on the
run with a hostage.

152
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,541
Shepherd Two is
pursing him alone.

153
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,000
You have to hurry!

154
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,291
I don't think she's going
to fare so well by herself.

155
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,833
Dammit.
Message has been received.

156
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,375
Stay right where
you are Hound One.

157
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,541
We'll head there
to assist you now!

158
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,625
It sounds like this so-called
game isn't over just yet.

159
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,875
I want both of you
on high alert got it?

160
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,000
I feel so heavy.

161
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,000
It doesn't even seem
like my own body right now.

162
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,541
That's probably because
it's full of bullets.

163
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,625
If I try to pull 'em out and
my nervous hands hit an artery,

164
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,541
you could be finished for good,
so I'll save that for the pros.

165
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,208
Honestly I can't believe
you're even conscious right now.

166
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,041
And where is
Inspector Tsunemori?

167
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,791
Yeah that's what
I'd like to know.

168
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,083
She ran off alone.

169
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,916
Apparently she was
chasing somebody.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,833
I've done all the
first aid I can,

171
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,583
and you're at least stabilized.

172
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,208
So I'm going after her now.

173
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,500
I'm coming too.

174
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,125
Are you an idiot?

175
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,958
I have to.

176
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,208
I hate to do that to a
guy who's already hurt,

177
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,000
but you're a stubborn ass

178
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,458
and I don't have the
time to argue with you.

179
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,791
I'd say If the people
responsible for this are strong

180
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
enough to mess you up,

181
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,083
that girl's in all
kinds of trouble.

182
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
Enforcer Masaoka!

183
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,958
Good of you to
join us, Inspector.

184
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,208
Hold down Kogami so he
won't try to follow me!

185
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,625
Don't know when
to quit, as usual.

186
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,958
What is it?

187
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,416
Looks like Ko shot
somebody really dangerous.

188
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,833
Toyohisa Senguji?

189
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,500
Oh, you have gotta
be kidding me.

190
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,083
Who's that?

191
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,625
Don't you watch the Ministry
of Welfare's recommended news?

192
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,083
Why the hell would
I watch that crap?

193
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,708
Stop right there!

194
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,541
This is the MWPSB!

195
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,458
Drop your weapon and surrender!

196
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,916
Crime Coefficient: 79.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,250
Enforcement action not required.

198
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,958
The trigger is now locked.

199
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,833
Akane help!

200
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,208
Just hold on Yuki,
you'll be fine.

201
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, yes. I know your face.

202
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,833
You're the promising young

203
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,750
Inspector Akane
Tsunemori aren't you?

204
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,791
And you're the madman
who dragged Yuki into this.

205
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,541
I'm Shogo. Shogo Makishima.

206
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,166
Makishima?

207
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,875
Interesting. So you've
heard my name before.

208
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,500
That's encouraging.

209
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,291
Nice to know you're
not completely clueless.

210
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,750
We've got serious
charges against you

211
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,583
for multiple
crimes in this city.

212
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,333
Based on the Citizen's
Charter, I demand you come

213
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,416
with me for questioning and
the due enforcement of the law!

214
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,375
If we need to talk, let's
do it right here, right now.

215
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,166
We're both busy people, right?

216
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,708
You think you
can escape from me?

217
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,750
Don't they train you to buy time

218
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,375
for your backup
in this situation?

219
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,208
You should promote lively
conversation to distract me.

220
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,458
I'm sure a more experienced
detective would remember that.

221
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,000
Now when you
said multiple crimes,

222
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,083
which exactly were
you referring to?

223
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,833
Masatake Mido?
Or perhaps Rikako Ouryou?

224
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,041
Just as I thought.

225
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,041
I think people only
have real value

226
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,458
when acting on their own
impulses and desires.

227
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,875
So I've asked quite a few people

228
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,250
about their
suppressed free will.

229
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,458
I encourage them, I facilitate.

230
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,166
And then I watch for
the truth to play out.

231
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Don't talk yourself up!

232
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,125
You're a criminal, nothing more!

233
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,458
There's a good conversation

234
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,750
starter--how do
we define criminal?

235
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,583
Maybe that Dominator
you're holding.

236
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,000
Shall we allow the Sibyl System

237
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,375
that which governs it
to decide what I am?

238
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,250
Crime Coefficient: under 50.

239
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,541
Enforcement action not required.

240
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,958
Trigger will remain locked.

241
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,500
By reading a bio-organism's
force field using

242
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,166
a cymatic scan some
very smart people

243
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,500
have found a way to
analyze a person's mind.

244
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,750
The intelligence of science

245
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,250
finally uncovered the
secret of our souls

246
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,333
and our society has changed
drastically because of it.

247
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,166
The problem is free will has
been stripped from the equation.

248
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,208
And if man is not
judged by their choices,

249
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,083
then how are we really deciding
who is good and who is evil?

250
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,375
What on earth are
you talking about?

251
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm talking about seeing

252
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,958
the naked splendor
of people's souls.

253
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,166
I want to see our
precious lives played out

254
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,000
on the stage of the world.

255
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,541
But how can our
souls be precious

256
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,041
if they're not utilized?

257
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,583
If we base our lives
on Sybil's Oracle

258
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,208
and not our own free will.

259
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,166
Then can our souls have value?

260
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,625
Well since I'm here. I guess
I'll try testing you too.

261
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,541
Let's put your judgment
as a detective to the test.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,708
Hold on. What are
you planning to do now?

263
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,291
I'm going to stand
next to this woman

264
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,416
named Yuki Funahara,
and I'm going to kill her.

265
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,000
Right before your eyes.

266
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,083
Crime Coefficient: 48.

267
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,458
No enforcement action required.

268
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,458
Trigger will remain locked.

269
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,416
If you want to stop
me, instead of using

270
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,916
that useless piece of
scrap metal and circuits,

271
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,875
you can pick up the gun
I just gave you and shoot me.

272
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,750
Pull the trigger and a bullet
will fire, it's your choice.

273
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,083
I can't do that.
It's not my decision.

274
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,708
That isn't how it works.

275
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,541
You mean because I'm a
good upstanding citizen?

276
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,333
Because that's what
trusty Sibyl has declared.

277
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,833
Crime Coefficient: 32.

278
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,583
No enforcement action required.

279
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,916
Trigger will remain locked.

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,333
What? But why?

281
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,000
That's a question I've
been asking for a long time.

282
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,875
Ever since I was a child
actually, my Psycho-Pass

283
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,791
has never been anything
but the purest white

284
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,375
It's never gotten cloudy,

285
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,708
not even for a moment I think
my body must be deluding itself.

286
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,791
Performing all sorts of vital
reactions as if I'm a saint.

287
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,083
Encouraging me to continue on

288
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,125
with a clean conscience,
doing whatever I want to do.

289
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,791
Help me! Akane. Do something!

290
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,291
Yuki!

291
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,208
You Inspectors just aren't
qualified to measure my sins.

292
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,833
If there are people
left in this world

293
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,875
who can judge me,
It is the fallen.

294
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,333
those who've shown
they have the freedom

295
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,041
to become killers
based on their own will.

296
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm warning you now,
let her go! Or else!

297
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,541
Or else you'll kill me?

298
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,750
Get up off of the sidelines?

299
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,416
And for once lay
claim to your own soul?

300
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,625
That would be a rather precious
ending in its own ironic way.

301
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,625
Feel it? The importance of life?

302
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,250
Resting gingerly
against your fingertip?

303
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,625
As long as you're
Sibyl's puppet,

304
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,833
you can never experience that.

305
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,750
That's the weight of
decision and free will.

306
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,083
Crime Coefficient: under 20.

307
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,875
No enforcement action required.

308
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,416
Trigger will remain locked.

309
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,791
René Descartes.

310
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,041
He said that those who can't
make a decision can't do

311
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,916
so either because their
passions are too great,

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,666
or because they lack
the sufficient intellect.

313
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,083
Find your resolve.

314
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,083
Unless you hold the gun
firmly, the bullet will miss.

315
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,041
Now. Aim with
the intent to kill.

316
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,791
Wha--? Akane

317
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,791
Not enough resolve.

318
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,625
How very regrettable for you.

319
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,291
Your failure has cost
your friend's life.

320
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,875
No! Help me ! Akane!

321
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,458
You've disappointed me.

322
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,250
So I have to give
you your punishment.

323
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,833
Don't. Please!

324
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,958
Regret helplessness, Akane.

325
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,208
And feel true despair.

326
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,041
Crime Coefficient: Zero.

327
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,791
No enforcement action required.

328
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,833
Trigger will remain locked.

329
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,541
Yuki No!!!

330
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,250
That's Akane!

331
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,291
So you're awake.

332
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,666
Where's Inspector Tsunemori?

333
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,750
I let her die
without doing anything.

334
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,333
I let her die without
doing anything.

335
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,041
Tell me what happened.

336
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,583
The man from the
picture. It, it was him.

337
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,000
What man, what do you mean?

338
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,833
Shogo Makishima.

339
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,708
The Dominator won't work.
It won't judge him.
