1
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,208
Hope you don't mind
me borrowing this, Pops.

2
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,708
I'm afraid your Hue's
reached a critical state.

3
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,500
In a way it's good your Crime
Coefficient is fluctuating.

4
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,125
It means there's still
time for treatment.

5
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,916
But that could change quickly.

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,333
You must be aware of
the worst case scenario

7
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,791
if you don't fix your Hue.

8
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,375
Sibyl would declare
you a latent criminal,

9
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,083
and your life as you know
it would come to an end.

10
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,958
It's funny.

11
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,375
This happened to my old partner.

12
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,833
His Hue got cloudy like this

13
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,333
and we weren't certain
which way it would go.

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,000
So what did your partner
do then? Did he fix it?

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,416
No, and it cost him his job.

16
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,500
Now I'm his boss.

17
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,750
It sure is ironic.

18
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,750
The way I've conducted
myself ever since.

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,333
It was all to avoid his fate,
yet here I am. What a joke.

20
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,416
I'll set up a therapy program
you can begin immediately.

21
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,166
I have to notify your
office, though, okay?

22
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,541
No, not yet.

23
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,375
I can't start it right now.

24
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,583
So you're leaving?

25
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,833
Doc, I think I'll be
okay for a little bit.

26
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,083
But I can't be held responsible

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,041
for anything that
happens to you now.

28
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,875
My current partner
is a young woman

29
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,541
who just became an
Inspector this year.

30
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,791
Watching her approach to
the job it gives me hope.

31
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,000
A positive attitude makes
for a clearer Hue, right?

32
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,625
Professor Saiga.

33
00:03:53,708 --> 00:04:00,000
You should get inside.

34
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,791
Now hold on.

35
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,500
Are you carrying a gun?

36
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,125
How'd you know?

37
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,583
It's an old revolver, isn't it?

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,583
What, are you a mind reader now?

39
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,375
As I always say, there's
nothing magical about

40
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,166
careful observations
and deductions, Kogami.

41
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,541
I'm sure most of you have

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,250
already heard the
bad news by now.

43
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,291
Kogami's escaped.
There's no doubt about it.

44
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,750
Yes.

45
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,791
He's going after Makishima.
But we are, too.

46
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,541
If you find the escaped
Enforcer don't hesitate

47
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,125
to do what's necessary.

48
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:49,500
You want us to capture Makishima
alive, but kill Kogami on sight?

49
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,791
That's right.

50
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,000
Why don't we put
this Kogami situation

51
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,583
on the back-burner for a while?

52
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,916
Let's not lose sight of the fact

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,958
that Makishima's
the active killer.

54
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,791
I wonder where that
monster's been hiding.

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,833
Least now his face
is in the system.

56
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,166
But in the riots' aftermath,

57
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,750
many of the city's cameras
and scanners are down.

58
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,958
It'll be five more days
before they're all back up.

59
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,750
That means we can't
count on facial recognition

60
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,583
to help us track him.

61
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,333
Why are we assuming
Makishima's still in the city?

62
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,375
He could be using this
time to leave the country.

63
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,833
No. He'll simply
adjust his plans.

64
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,208
He won't flee.

65
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,333
It's not in his nature to give
up just 'cause there's heat.

66
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,083
He'll wage his war on our system
until his last dying breath.

67
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,916
Our society is built
on careful control.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,791
He's injecting it
with raw human nature.

69
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,708
That's why he called
Kogami that night.

70
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,500
To arouse his base curiosity.

71
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,666
He wants to wake us all up.

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,041
It's been a busy week.

73
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,291
Are you okay?

74
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,625
I guess so.

75
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,958
The team can't afford
for me not to be, though.

76
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,333
Well, my life's no bed of roses,

77
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,708
but if you ever need
someone to talk to.

78
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,250
Guess I haven't really
opened up about any of this.

79
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,083
If Kogami becomes...

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,791
If he becomes a real killer.

81
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,125
As opposed to a latent criminal.

82
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,958
Well, I can't let that happen.

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,041
Look, Akane.

84
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,041
You shouldn't be trying to
shoulder all this on your own.

85
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,375
I'll be fine!

86
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
Look, if you're worried
about my Psycho-Pass,

87
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,125
you're welcome to check my Hue.

88
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,833
In fact, I already ran
a check this morning.

89
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,791
Despite everything,
it's still pale turquoise.

90
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,958
Why doesn't this affect me?
Am I that cold-hearted?

91
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,791
Your heart and Psycho-Pass
are two very different things.

92
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,375
But then what is a
person's Psycho-Pass?

93
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,083
And what's their heart?
I don't know anymore.

94
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,750
You didn't sleep.

95
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,000
I was up all night
thinking about Makishima.

96
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,833
Trying to predict his next move.

97
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,083
But so far, nothing seems right.

98
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,083
Next move? You think
he's going to kill again?

99
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,541
There are five more days before

100
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,333
the metro area's security
network's fully restored.

101
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,583
That's the info I got
out of the CID's analyst.

102
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
I'm sure he knows, too.

103
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,875
That's a hundred
and twenty hours left

104
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,166
for him to pull off
his grand finale.

105
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,000
I made coffee.

106
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,916
It's brewed from real beans,
so it's nice and strong.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,541
Thanks, Saiga. I need it.

108
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,625
I read over

109
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,666
all the Makishima case
information you brought along.

110
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,125
I can see why you're
having a hard time.

111
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,791
I'll take any help I can get.

112
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,708
If our society was still
home to 20th Century-style,

113
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,333
political radicals
or reactionaries.

114
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,000
He'd be the one
leading the charge.

115
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,333
Terrorists, anarchists.
Leftists, Rightists,

116
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,083
Mass shooters, and bombers.

117
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,625
Really, anyone who
targets innocent civilians.

118
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,791
All misanthropic madmen.

119
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,583
How would you define anarchism?

120
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,208
It's the complete
absence of government.

121
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,791
Not just civil disorder,
it's the lack of civil anything.

122
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,500
Ah.

123
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,958
That's right.

124
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,291
It's denying the artificial
systems of human control.

125
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,250
The only laws followed
are those of nature.

126
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,375
Makishima is close
to being an anarchist.

127
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,958
But he enjoys
destruction, too much.

128
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,625
He's different from
the strict definition.

129
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,500
"An artificial system
of human control.".

130
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,416
Sounds like the
Sibyl System to me.

131
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,541
To paraphrase
Max Weber's writings.

132
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,666
The ideal bureaucrat is one who
performs his duty without anger,

133
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,416
or fondness, and without
hate or zealousness.

134
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,125
And without love or
personal predilection,

135
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,708
and therefore, without grace.

136
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,333
If Weber were to be transported
to our time and country,

137
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,208
he'd say the Sibyl System
is the bureaucrat perfected.

138
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,291
That's assuming that it does not
malfunction or make mistakes.

139
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
And that everything
we've been told about

140
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,791
its specs is accurate.

141
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,666
The other day, he called me.

142
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,458
Told me he found out
the true nature of Sibyl.

143
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,208
And that it's not something

144
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,625
I should be risking
my life to protect.

145
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,583
Allow me to paraphrase
some more of Weber's writing.

146
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,208
A bureaucratic
administration dominates

147
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,041
the people through its firm
command of knowledge.

148
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,375
Both technical and
practical expertise. And then.

149
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,333
They keep everything a secret
to increase their control.

150
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,375
Makishima is trying to strip
away the System's control.

151
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,875
And he nearly succeeded, too.

152
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,375
His riots pushed our
society right up to a line,

153
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,750
that if crossed, we'd be
unable to come back from.

154
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,250
So someone high up in
the Ministry of Welfare

155
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,125
made an offer to Makishima.

156
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,583
But it was an offer
that he clearly refused.

157
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,625
I wish I could sit down
and talk with that man.

158
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,916
And of course, record the whole
interview for full analysis.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,708
You mean for your own research?

160
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,708
He doesn't interest
me that way, yet.

161
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,666
It'd just be as a resource
to help your investigation.

162
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,208
If Makishima was here,
eating breakfast with us.

163
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,500
What do you think
he'd talk about?

164
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,875
Well let's see.

165
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,000
He'd respond with quotes

166
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,625
from Michel Foucault
or Jeremy Bentham.

167
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,333
That'd be his rebuttal
to your quoting

168
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,958
of Max Weber's
"Economy and Society."

169
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,166
What you call a safe
society, I call a prison.

170
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,833
Panopticon.

171
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,708
A facility that allows you to
observe every prisoner at once.

172
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,083
Sibyl is the worst form,

173
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
as it lets hundreds
control the lives of millions.

174
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,500
He might even start quoting
from Gulliver's Travels

175
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,458
to keep things interesting.

176
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:06,041
He's a cynical man, with
a peculiar sense of humor.

177
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:10,458
I see. He enjoys satirizing
the rapid pace of technology.

178
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,291
You could say
he's social critic.

179
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,125
I'm gonna ask you a
personal question now.

180
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,791
Do you see similarities
between yourself and Makishima?

181
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,166
He has some traits I understand.

182
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,708
But I know nothing about
his past or upbringing.

183
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,708
One thing I am
certain of, though.

184
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,875
He must've gone through a hell

185
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,416
of a turning point
some time in his life.

186
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,083
A moment where he realized
how truly different he is.

187
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:46,291
He can control his Psycho-Pass
through willpower alone.

188
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,916
Most people would regard
that as a great privilege.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,333
But Makishima is not "most
people." Instead of excitement.

190
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,041
I think he felt something
more like alienation.

191
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,458
If you grow up in this
society and the Sibyl System

192
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,375
doesn't acknowledge you,
isn't it basically saying

193
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,666
you're not a true human being?

194
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,125
Like the child none of the other
kids ever want to play with.

195
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,541
Makes sense.

196
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,666
That early feeling of
alienation became the catalyst

197
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
for his future crimes.

198
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,375
Yeah, but this
all just a theory.

199
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,541
We won't know.

200
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,041
Unless we find him
and ask him ourselves.

201
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,875
But you're not looking for
him just so you can talk.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,250
Right.

203
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
Hm.

204
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,708
When you're done cleaning
up, come to my study.

205
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,041
I have something
you'll find interesting.

206
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,750
It's quite simple.

207
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,333
The people who know
Kogami's way of thinking best.

208
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,541
Are the ones you should
have leading his man-hunt.

209
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,833
My team can predict his next
moves better than anyone else.

210
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,541
I see.

211
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,666
Well, what did she say?

212
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Our mission hasn't changed.

213
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,625
Division One will keep
hunting for Makishima.

214
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,958
But we'll neutralize
Kogami at the same time.

215
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,708
Ah come on. Damn.

216
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,000
It's a bad idea.
Spearheading this.

217
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
You and the Little Missy
both need to learn

218
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,500
when to step back and lay low.

219
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,875
Division One has
to lead both hunts!

220
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,333
We can give Ko a chance
to surrender peacefully,

221
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,333
rather than being
shot with a Dominator.

222
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,708
Aw, Nobuchika.

223
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,791
You've seen enough
to know how this ends.

224
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,875
Even if you do bring
in Kogami peacefully,

225
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,791
they'll just send him to
the facility to be executed.

226
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,500
Working these cases
won't save him,

227
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,583
but you volunteering for it
puts our lives on the line, too.

228
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,958
That's why I think you should
let Division Three handle it.

229
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,166
I won't make this
someone else's problem!

230
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,000
I bet you knew what he was
thinking and didn't speak up!

231
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,750
You probably watched
Kogami waltz right out

232
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,625
of this building without
even trying to stop him!

233
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,250
You're okay with letting
him kill Makishima!

234
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,083
You're not only
breeching our trust.

235
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,083
You're also committing
a criminal act!

236
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,500
And no matter
what excuses you may

237
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,458
have you won't get
them past a Dominator.

238
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
You want me to check
your Crime Coefficient

239
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,166
to know the know the truth?

240
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,291
Dammit!

241
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,083
Dammit!

242
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,625
You're all the same.

243
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,916
Everyone leaves me for
the other side of the law.

244
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,916
Do you and Kogami.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,750
Want to be vigilante
heroes that badly?

246
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,833
It isn't that.

247
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,416
We're just obsessed.

248
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,166
Even though your brain tells you

249
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,541
there are wiser ways
to live in this world.

250
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,875
You can't turn your
back on that obsession,

251
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,166
or else everything you've built
for yourself becomes a sham.

252
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,333
That's what Kogami and
I are feeling during this.

253
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,791
Oh I see. And only Enforcers
can understand, right?

254
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,625
It's not an Enforcer thing.

255
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,208
It's more like what you
would call a man's pride.

256
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,333
Good for you, but I have
my own kind of pride.

257
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,333
I'll capture that idiot
Kogami with my two hands.

258
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,666
And I don't care
what anyone says.

259
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,625
We're done with him.

260
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,500
But in our current situation,

261
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,166
there's no one else immediately
available to use as a pawn.

262
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,333
You're sure?

263
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,666
Is that the collective's
final decision?

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,375
Yes, hold on.

265
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,250
I can't fully understand
this with my current capacity.

266
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,041
I'd like to go back there
and confirm the consensus.

267
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,291
Professor, what am I looking at?

268
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,125
This is an old-fashioned
anonymous message board.

269
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,000
It's hosted and continually
backed up on overseas servers.

270
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,208
Wait, Overseas servers?

271
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,083
If you know where to look,
they're out there.

272
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,583
Obviously, though,
this one hasn't been

273
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,875
caught by the Sibyl System yet.

274
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,333
The posters on this board
are former college professors,

275
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,250
journalists, cultural critics,
literary scholars.

276
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,750
Basically, people
whom Sibyl declared

277
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,041
to be useless in
the new civil order.

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,958
Even now, they're still venting

279
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,041
about how Sibyl
ruined their lives.

280
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,166
They say that Sibyl's
useless and broken.

281
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,750
That, it needs to be shut down.

282
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,666
It may never produce results,

283
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,875
but at least it
gives people a voice.

284
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,083
I started a new
thread earlier. Here.

285
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,250
My God.

286
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,541
So far they've responded as if

287
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,750
it's nothing more than
a thought experiment.

288
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,833
All I'm seeing so far are
a bunch of sarcastic jokes.

289
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,166
Then why don't you
look through them

290
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,458
and tell me which one
you think is the funniest.

291
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,083
You and Makishima
are alike in that way.

292
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,958
Go with your gut. Maybe
that choice will inspire you.

293
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,208
What's is it?

294
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,666
Here's something
that caught my eye.

295
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,666
Stopping food production to
collapse the Sibyl System.

296
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,750
The Hyper Oats.

297
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,458
Ninety-nine percent
of all food consumed

298
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,083
in our country is processed,
and derived from Hyper Oats.

299
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,041
This genetically
modified grain possesses

300
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,250
the ultimate harvest efficiency,
but their omnipresence

301
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,416
means the food supply
has a single failure-point.

302
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,875
That's the problem

303
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,083
with a "monospecific genus"
lacking genetic diversity.

304
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,333
If a virus were to hit
the Hyper Oat crops,

305
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,416
our food supply could
be wiped out overnight.

306
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,541
What if this this is
Makishima's next target.

307
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,166
Our food self-sufficiency.

308
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,208
Yes.

309
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,416
I think we're on to something.

310
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,875
Food stuffs,
genetic mods, harvest tech...

311
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,833
you have any info
on those things?

312
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,083
Hold on.

313
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,583
Due to the drop in population,

314
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,750
and the subsequent
implementation of Sibyl.

315
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,833
More people now live
in urban areas than

316
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,583
at any other time in
our country's history.

317
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,250
But while a person can always
move, the land cannot.

318
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,875
So with no more people
in the countryside.

319
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,541
Our agriculture industry
was fully automated.

320
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,708
Mechanized farming by drones.

321
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,333
Crops of genetically
engineered Hyper Oats.

322
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,708
Disease prevention
with altered viruses.

323
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,750
These tools and technologies are

324
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,875
what make automated farming
possible, but in the process,

325
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,541
they've forever eliminated
agriculture as an occupation.

326
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,083
These days, the Hokuriku
area is devoid of people;

327
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,916
it's nothing but a vast granary.

328
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,458
That poster was right.

329
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,208
If the management systems of
crop health were compromised.

330
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,500
The entire Hyper Oats
yield could be devastated

331
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,125
by diseases owing to its
being a monospecific genus.

332
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,291
And if Hyper Oats failed,
Japan would cease

333
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,666
to be self-sufficient, and
would have to import food.

334
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,833
The government would have to

335
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,958
rescind their
isolationist policies,

336
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,583
and begin talking with
outside countries again.

337
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,875
And with mass food shortages.

338
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,125
The average Crime Coefficient
of everyone

339
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,083
in Japan would skyrocket.

340
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,166
Don't forget what else
food imports hasten.

341
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,250
More relaxed border security
and the start of immigration.

342
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,125
We could see waves of refugees.

343
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,750
Measuring Crime Coefficients
would become

344
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,500
too much for the
system to manage.

345
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,000
But Makishima can't make
this happen on his own.

346
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,833
Right now, I bet he's
seeking out someone's help.

347
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,833
A man who knows
about Hyper Oats.

348
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,625
I know you're planning
to kill Shogo Makishima,

349
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,958
and I offered you help to do so.

350
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,458
And since I did it knowingly.

351
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,333
The next time someone
from the Bureau stops by.

352
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,750
I will probably be
leaving with them.

353
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,291
I'm so sorry I got
you involved like this.

354
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,625
Don't worry about it.

355
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,750
Seems like a fair punishment
for removing myself

356
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,083
from society all these years.

357
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,666
Professor.

358
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,166
By giving you a hand
with his killing I feel

359
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,041
that I'm fulfilling my own
role in this game. But...

360
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,500
I hate that I'm dumping all
the dirty work at your feet.

361
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,833
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,166
An old student as talented
as you deserves better.

363
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,625
Don't think that way,
sensei, I'll be fine.

364
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,500
And to be honest
with you, Professor.

365
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,541
I can't imagine someone other
than me bringing down Makishima.

366
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,833
Kogami.

367
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,583
Inspector Akane Tsunemori.

368
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,041
It is now time.

369
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,000
You will be told the
truth about everything.
