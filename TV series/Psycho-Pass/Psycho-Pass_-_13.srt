1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,083
Your Crime Coefficient's
gotten worse

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,958
I see.

3
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,708
Since we last met,
it's gone up seven points.

4
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,000
That's a number we can't ignore.

5
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,375
In fact, if it gets any worse,

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,208
the law requires me to
report it to your superiors.

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,833
I've been using
relaxation exercises

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,833
and therapeutic
devices to manage it.

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,791
Maybe you need
to find one simple

10
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,666
and effective method,
and focus on that.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,708
Like what?

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,916
Instead of just me,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,666
talk to someone with
whom you're very close.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,333
Like a lover or family member.

15
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,166
I don't have a girlfriend.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,708
And my family, well

17
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,708
Only my father's alive.

18
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,000
Even a grown, independent
man can always learn

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,416
a thing or two from a
long talk with his father.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,625
Unless you have some
reason not to talk.

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,250
Is there one?

22
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,625
Well, actually...

23
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,916
Yes?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,166
There's a very good reason.

25
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,750
I read the report.

26
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,750
I'm wondering about
Tsunemori's testimony

27
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,708
Do you think what she says
is one hundred percent true?

28
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,750
We were quite thorough when
we inspected the crime scene.

29
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,625
Her distance to the target
was just under eight meters.

30
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,416
Her position relative to
the victim was also clear.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,666
There's no doubt the murderer
slashed the girl's throat

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,000
right in front of Inspector
Tsunemori and yet,

33
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,916
her Dominator refused
to function properly.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,041
I understand Tsunemori
and the victim,

35
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,666
Yuki Funahara,
were close friends.

36
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,041
Isn't it possible she panicked

37
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,750
and simply operated the
Dominator incorrectly?

38
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,916
I would never describe
Akane as incompetent.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,458
But in a previous report,

40
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,208
you said her inexperience
as an Inspector

41
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,666
could soon prove detrimental.

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,291
That has nothing to do
with her raw aptitude.

43
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,541
All her qualifications
to serve as an Inspector

44
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,375
have been confirmed by Sibyl's
Occupational Aptitude Test.

45
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,208
But again, you've signed off
on a report contradicting

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,541
what you say now, a report
that questions Sibyl's judgment.

47
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,333
Inspector Ginoza,
we now live in a world

48
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,541
of almost limitless prosperity.

49
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,500
We have achieved
the greatest happiness

50
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,500
for the greatest
amount of people.

51
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,625
To what do you believe
we owe our thanks

52
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
for making such a world?

53
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,958
That would be the Ministry
of Welfare's Sibyl System.

54
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,666
That's right.

55
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,041
Planning out your whole life.
Fulfilling your desires.

56
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,458
No matter what choices
the citizens are making

57
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,750
they can simply ask
for Sibyl's Judgment,

58
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,958
rather than
agonize over it alone.

59
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,000
With the Sibyl System,
we are putting

60
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,583
in place a society of
absolute personal fulfillment,

61
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,500
and communal safety that is
unprecedented in human history.

62
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,791
I know.

63
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,041
And that is why Sibyl
must work flawlessly.

64
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,083
Yes.

65
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,458
Not a single mistake
can be allowed.

66
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,791
That's our ideal.

67
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,833
But think on that
for a moment, Ginoza.

68
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,416
If the Sibyl System
is working flawlessly.

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,625
It should no longer be
necessary for humans

70
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,416
to be in the loop at all.

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,333
We could equip all the drones

72
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,916
with Dominators and
have them patrol the city.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,833
But, alas, the MWPSB is home

74
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,083
to the Criminal
Investigation Department.

75
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,416
And it is upon you
that responsibility

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,083
for the Dominators--Sibyl's
eyes--ultimately falls.

77
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,250
Ever thought about the
meaning of this arrangement?

78
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,375
Yes, ma'am of course.

79
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
No matter how perfect
any system we create

80
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,000
may be it will always
require a safety net

81
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,750
to protect against
unforeseeable occurrences.

82
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,666
To respond quickly
to an emergency

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,958
To overcome hardware breakdowns

84
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,958
It is only when such
fail safes are included

85
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,875
that a system becomes perfect

86
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,125
in both operation
and perception.

87
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,375
In fact, Inspector,
it's more important

88
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
we merely believe it so than
the Sibyl System does function

89
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,000
perfectly every time
a crime's committed.

90
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,916
From the sense of security
that comes with that belief

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,833
It brings blessings to people
even as you stand here now.

92
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,125
Yes.

93
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
Ginoza

94
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,541
I've developed a very high
opinion of your skills.

95
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,291
Normally, those of your rank
are not allowed to see the

96
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,916
classified information
I'm about to show you.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,791
But I think in this instance,

98
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,916
our trusting
relationship allows for it.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,333
This is top secret.

100
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,791
Is that...?

101
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,000
It's the record
of a man's arrest.

102
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,958
Only, the police
took him into custody

103
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,791
without ever measuring
his Crime Coefficient.

104
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,583
The statement we
released on the record,

105
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,750
though, says he
came in voluntarily.

106
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,958
It him It's Touma.

107
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,500
He's the prime suspect
in a serial murder case

108
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,791
that panicked the
city three years ago.

109
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,625
Recall "the Specimen Case"?

110
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,500
At least, I believe
that's the name

111
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,458
you and your people
gave it at the time.

112
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,750
In the end, though,
it was Division Two'

113
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,166
who brought him in,
and they were subsequently

114
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,250
put under the
strictest of gag orders.

115
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,041
Dammit!

116
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,416
Do you have any idea what
we went through on that!

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,666
It's just like this current
case you're working.

118
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,416
Despite catching
him in a violent act

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
and having overwhelming evidence

120
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,583
tying him to several
other murders

121
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,583
The Dominators refused
to give a reading

122
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,791
when pointed at Kouzaburo Touma.

123
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:41,416
Because his Crime Coefficient
didn't reach a regulation value.

124
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,166
We call these rare murderers

125
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,333
like Touma a criminally
asymptomatic person.

126
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,291
I don't understand.

127
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,916
It's a classification for cases

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,041
where a person's
Cymatic Scan doesn't match

129
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,041
his criminal psychology.

130
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,750
We estimate only one out
of every two million people

131
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,416
could be classified as
criminally asymptomatic.

132
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,416
Your case with Shogo Makishima
is certainly unique,

133
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,708
but it's hardly surprising.

134
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,375
In fact, there's
even some indication

135
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,916
he played a role in the
Specimen Case, correct?

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,375
Touma and Makishima.

137
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,000
Two criminally asymptomatic men

138
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,500
working together to
commit serial murders.

139
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,791
It's no wonder the case
gave us such difficulty.

140
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,833
So then what happened to Touma?

141
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,583
Was he executed?

142
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,083
Our official press release
declared him missing,

143
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,041
suspected of
leaving the country.

144
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,791
And I'm afraid that's
all I can to tell you

145
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,791
about this matter
for the time being.

146
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,416
Please don't get hung up on the
specifics of what you heard.

147
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
The important thing is
no one has fallen victim

148
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,250
to Kouzaburou Touma's murderous
impulses since that day.

149
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,083
We just made him disappear.

150
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,416
His case didn't reveal a
flaw in the Sibyl System.

151
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,541
Nor did it shake the
public's confidence in it.

152
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,250
He's simply gone and forgotten.

153
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,166
The PSB is really just the
tail of our system's body.

154
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,875
And the general
public only recognizes

155
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,583
and understands this
system through that tail.

156
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,291
That means,
the system's credibility

157
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,791
rests entirely on how well,

158
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,458
and strictly, people judge
the tail to be functioning.

159
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,416
If the PSB begins
doubting the Dominators

160
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,625
It could lead to the
public at large having

161
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,875
a crisis of confidence
in the Sibyl System

162
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,916
and our society's order.

163
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,541
Are we clear?

164
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,000
I just remembered
that the report

165
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,583
we submitted was incomplete.

166
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,083
That's fine.

167
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,541
Please turn in the new
version tomorrow morning.

168
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,125
Of course, you'll
also need to prepare

169
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,791
a new explanation
for what happened

170
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,250
that night that your
colleagues will accept.

171
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,458
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you Ginoza.

173
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,291
I'm glad to see already
that my confidence in

174
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,958
you was well-placed.

175
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,041
Next, you are to bring
down Shogo Makishima.

176
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,125
He must be isolated from
society as soon as possible.

177
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,583
But don't harm him.

178
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,916
Immediate punishment
or execution

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,916
still requires Sibyl's input.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,625
Yes. I understand.

181
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,208
Ginoza, it's essential that
you bring him to PSB alive.

182
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,125
Then you can leave
the rest to me.

183
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,916
Shogo Makishima will never
again threaten our quest

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,166
for a more perfect society.

185
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,041
Just as Kouzaburou Touma hasn't.

186
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,958
Kogami!

187
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,500
Hey.

188
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,500
An old book?

189
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,750
Yep.

190
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,708
Thanks for coming by.

191
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,625
Sure.

192
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,916
I took time off.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,250
I mean, they made me
take a few days off.

194
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,833
Did you have the funeral yet?

195
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,583
Two days ago.

196
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,083
I see.

197
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,083
I'm so sorry.

198
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,541
What are you sorry for?

199
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,500
Makishima got away because
I couldn't kill him.

200
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,333
You didn't do anything wrong.

201
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,916
You didn't fail.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
It was your Dominator that did.

203
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,250
That's what happened right?

204
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,708
Forensics says there was
nothing wrong with the gun.

205
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,458
Ginoza's talking to the brass,

206
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,916
to get more resources
for looking into it.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,208
Up til now,
Makishima's stayed hidden.

208
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,666
Maybe he's developed
some strategy or trick

209
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,625
A way to always be
one step ahead of us

210
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,083
and the technologies we employ,
like the Dominators.

211
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,291
You're always the detective.
That's nice.

212
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,166
You sound like you've already
recovered pretty well, too.

213
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,500
Well, I can't mope
around forever.

214
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,416
Not with Shogo Makishima
still out there.

215
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,000
He killed my friend
right in front of me.

216
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,333
And he killed yours, too.

217
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,875
Yes he did.

218
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,958
Just saying that
makes me feel better.

219
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,625
I think I'm gonna go now.

220
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,666
As horrible as this sounds,

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,708
there is one bright side to this
nightmare we're going through.

222
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,375
Now we know Makishima is real.

223
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,666
No one will ever doubt
your police work again.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,416
From here on out,
we share the same goal

225
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,250
We do whatever it
takes to get Makishima

226
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,583
and avenge our friends' murders.

227
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,125
Tsunemori is
working on a photofit?

228
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,166
That's right.

229
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,000
She's going to
do a memory scoop.

230
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,791
It's that new process
they've developed

231
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,583
to visualize a
witness's memories

232
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,958
by reading their
brain waves directly.

233
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,416
Akane, she's hell
bent on constructing

234
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
the best image yet
of Makishima's face.

235
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,750
It makes sense.

236
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,291
She's the first
person we know of

237
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,791
who's actually
gotten a clear view

238
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,500
of the guy and lived
to tell about it.

239
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,125
She'll be forcing herself to
relive her best friend's murder!

240
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,750
She'll have to
watch that monster

241
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,291
cut Yuki's throat right
in front of her again!

242
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,791
I know! And we've all
tried stopping her!

243
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,375
The worst thing, though, is.

244
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,708
How it's gonna mess
up her Psycho-Pass.

245
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583
Then, why?

246
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,708
She said she won't stop until
she brings this guy down.

247
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Makishima.

248
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,208
Which is why I don't think

249
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,625
you have any right
to get mad at her,

250
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,041
especially considering how
much she sounds like you,

251
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,041
now that's she's all obsessed.

252
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,250
Is that Kogami?

253
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,125
Yes. Kagari must have told him

254
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,500
about my plans to
do a memory scoop.

255
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,333
Maybe you should talk to him.

256
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,750
It'd be a waste of time.

257
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,583
He'd just try to convince
me it's a bad idea.

258
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,333
Even though he's always
taking risks himself.

259
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,875
I don't like it either.
Too risky.

260
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,125
And your Psycho-Pass has already

261
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,166
been clouded enough
from the murder.

262
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,000
Worst-case scenario,

263
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,958
you would end up becoming
a latent criminal yourself.

264
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,500
The Chief gave us orders.

265
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,208
Do not conduct a
public investigation.

266
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,750
Yes. Because this is a
very sensitive matter.

267
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,958
There's an elite
team investigating it.

268
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,208
Until they release
their official report,

269
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,333
you're not to tell
a soul what happened.

270
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,250
We can't wait for
some secret report.

271
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,208
If it's not a public case,
it's hard to get clues.

272
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,208
We need a clear image of him.

273
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,416
But...

274
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,291
If it takes my Crime
Coefficient going up

275
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,333
to get the picture, so be it.

276
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,583
I don't care if
I become an Enforcer.

277
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,000
As long as we get Makishima.

278
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,458
You shouldn't be flippant
about things like that!

279
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,791
Ginoza It'll be alright.

280
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,541
Don't forget:
My greatest strength is

281
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,125
that my Psycho-Pass
won't cloud easily.

282
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay, Akane. We're set.

283
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,250
Thanks.

284
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,791
I'll be monitoring
your physical condition

285
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,958
and Psycho-Pass the whole time.

286
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,250
Don't worry. I trust
you, Karanomori.

287
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,666
Alright alright.

288
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,666
Relax and leave the rest to me.

289
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,708
You'll come through
this just fine.

290
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,583
Focus your thoughts
on the moment

291
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,583
when you first met Makishima.

292
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,250
'Kay.

293
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,250
Once I can lock in on
the specific brain signal

294
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,791
from that memory,
I'll amplify it.

295
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,000
But be prepared for it to cause
you severe emotional distress.

296
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,625
Okay, I'm ready for it.

297
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,791
Perfect. I'll start now then.

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,250
There's a good
conversation starter--

299
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,791
how do we define criminal?

300
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,583
Maybe that Dominator
you're holding?

301
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,000
Shall we allow the Sibyl System

302
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,875
that governs it to
decide what I am?

303
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,208
Crime Coefficient: under 50.

304
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,041
Enforcement action not required.

305
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,291
Trigger will remain locked.

306
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,666
Help me! Akane

307
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
Not enough resolve.

308
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,500
How very regrettable for you.

309
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,333
Your failure has
cost your friend's life.

310
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,875
Akane!

311
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,541
No enforcement action required.

312
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,625
Trigger will remain locked.

313
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,416
Yuki No!!!

314
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:26,833
Help her!

315
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,416
I'm tryng.

316
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,375
Inspector! Are you okay?

317
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,500
Inspector, come back to us!

318
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,291
Hey! Wake up Akane!

319
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,458
Sorry.

320
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,208
G- Ginoza?

321
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah. Are you okay?

322
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,083
Inspector!

323
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,583
The Memory Scoop was successful.

324
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,416
And I'm already processing
an image of Makishima.

325
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,083
How's her Psycho-Pass?

326
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,291
So far, so good.

327
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,375
Her Hue curve is
within regulation value.

328
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,416
And her Crime
Coefficient is Incredible.

329
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,458
It spiked for a moment,
but then it stabilized

330
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,083
and is already showing
signs of recovery!

331
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,875
Inspector Tsunemori

332
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,958
See. I told you it would work.

333
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,125
I can't believe you did it.

334
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,333
They let you out already!

335
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,416
It's because I threatened
the doctors.

336
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,958
Said I'd burn down the room if
they kept me there any longer.

337
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,583
That's the Ko we know and love!

338
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,875
I'm kidding.
I talked them into it.

339
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,416
Any update on how
Inspector Tsunemori's doing?

340
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,166
Still at the nurse's office,
getting some mental care.

341
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,958
But according to what
Karanomori told us earlier,

342
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,166
she's supposed
to make a full recovery.

343
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,208
Not every day your
coworker's a cute girl

344
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,583
with balls made of steel.

345
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,375
To be honest, it freaks me out.

346
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,750
She goes through all that

347
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,125
and her Psycho-Pass doesn't
even enter the red zone!

348
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,166
But what was the plan
if something did happen!

349
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,166
Trust me, Ko, you weren't the
only one who was asking that.

350
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,583
But it's done.

351
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,750
And for now, all that matters
is her gamble paid off.

352
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,000
That's him?

353
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,291
Shogo Makishima.

354
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,625
We already had the folks

355
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,166
at Ousou Academy
look it over. Guess what.

356
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,041
Both students
and faculty testified

357
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,625
that Shogo Makishima is also

358
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,625
their former art instructor,
"Yukimori Shibata."

359
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,000
That alone's enough

360
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,333
to bring him in for the
Rikako Ouryou case.

361
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,541
At the very least as
a "person of interest."

362
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,041
And now that we have his image,

363
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,958
we're searching the recordings
of every security camera

364
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,875
in the city to see
where he's been.

365
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,333
You'll never guess
the first hit we got.

366
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,833
the entrance to Shoko Sugawara's
apartment building.

367
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,916
Remember her?

368
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,666
Also known as, Spooky Boogie.

369
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,666
Was a victim in
the Talisman Case.

370
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,583
We also requested and received
priority search order with the

371
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,333
facial recognition programs
for current video feeds.

372
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,125
When he shows, we'll
be immediately notified.

373
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,791
Tsunemori

374
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,958
She's become a
helluva detective.

375
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,125
I can't believe you
wanted to talk to me alone.

376
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,208
what's next, tomorrow
there's a blizzard?

377
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,916
There's zero percent chance
of precipitation this week.

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,416
What?

379
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Are you a robot, I'm just
making an old joke, Inspector.

380
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,166
So.

381
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,958
What is it you want?

382
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,291
It's about Inspector Tsunemori.

383
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,833
I have some questions.

384
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,833
Yeah, what about
the little Missy?

385
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,833
Why doesn't her Hue get clouded?

386
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,625
What's her secret to
managing her stress so well?

387
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,041
Why would you think
I have the answer?

388
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,708
It just seems like you're
closer to her than me.

389
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,416
I doubt I know more about
her emotions than you,

390
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,958
but one thing I am sure of:

391
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,541
The prospect of her
Crime Coefficient changing

392
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,958
does not give her
any anxiety whatsoever.

393
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,541
Let me see if
I can put this right

394
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,875
It's like she accepts
things as they are.

395
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:06,166
She acknowledges society
and forgives it then moves on.

396
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,000
From this inner peace, comes
an ability to take risks.

397
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,791
She's confident enough to zig

398
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,000
when everybody else
tells her to zag.

399
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,166
And still, she's fully
committed to being a detective,

400
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,375
even has the skills
to be great one.

401
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,458
Are you trying to tell me

402
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,208
that you have lost
that commitment?

403
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,750
Maybe.

404
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,833
I don't know.

405
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
See, When I was her age,

406
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,333
I had the same belief in justice

407
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,750
and society's need
for a good detective.

408
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,291
Then I had to trade in my pistol

409
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,708
for a new gun that
could talk back to me.

410
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,541
One that would only let me shoot

411
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,458
when it had made up
its electronic mind

412
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,291
that I needed to
capture or kill someone.

413
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,500
It pissed me the hell off.

414
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,958
The gun never said it,

415
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,958
but it clearly told me my
detective work was obsolete.

416
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,458
I dwelled on it.

417
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,208
And the angrier I got, the
cloudier my Psycho-Pass got.

418
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,875
If you questioned
the system that much,

419
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,375
why not quit the MWPSB?

420
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,250
Instead you made me

421
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,250
and Mom pay the
price when you gave up.

422
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,041
When you stopped
believing in the new order.

423
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,125
God dammit!

424
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,791
How can you even stand here and
whine about Dominators to me?

425
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,458
You're right,
Ginoza, I complain;

426
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,166
talk about taking some
stand against "The Man".

427
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,666
And yet, I'm still here,
working a beat.

428
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,833
You began doubting
the Sibyl System.

429
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,833
And then it began doubting you.

430
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,500
Whether you liked it or not,
a new order was born

431
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,750
and the world and
I moved on without you.

432
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,333
Yeah.

433
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,833
And I guess my initial doubts
might've even been misplaced.

434
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,333
By the time
I stopped being angry

435
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,500
and I made
my peace with this world

436
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,333
My Crime Coefficient
had stabilized.

437
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:50,041
Man, talk about being late
to the party, huh, kid?

438
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,666
So. What about you then?

439
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,708
Your Hue? Are you maintaining
a nice, clear color on it?

440
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,500
I don't need you pretending
to care about my Psycho-Pass.

441
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,791
So you can stop with this sad,
"concerned father" routine.

442
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,875
Nah, it's more like

443
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,166
a subordinate
concerned for his boss.

444
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,875
One who's due for a promotion.

445
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,750
It's like what I was saying
about my Hue clouding up.

446
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,666
If you begin questioning
your job one day,

447
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,666
the next might see
getting frustrated

448
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,375
and angry about the world
around you; so be careful.

449
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,125
I don't wanna see you
fall into the same spiral

450
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:25,458
that led to me getting labeled
a latent criminal, son.

451
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,000
We've identified you and
you're at the end of the line

452
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,041
Shogo.
