1
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,291
That's what I said!

2
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,500
Give me your portable
terminals and credit cards.

3
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,208
And the passwords too. Now!

4
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,250
Stop it! Stop!
Please, I'm begging you!

5
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,041
Come on, quit lying!

6
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,375
Old people still keep money
under their mattresses, right?

7
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,916
I saw it on the news.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,208
And I can convert that
cash without laundering.

9
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,041
So I want it now.

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,125
We don't keep cash.

11
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,541
We thought that
wouldn't be safe.

12
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,958
Okay, class.

13
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,750
We've gathered all
the top honor students

14
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,000
from this fine institution.

15
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,625
Today's lesson won't be easy.

16
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you realize how unfair it is?

17
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,208
You've all got
promising futures.

18
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,041
And us? We've got shit.

19
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,583
We know we're gonna fail at
everything before we even try.

20
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,250
Why are you doing this?

21
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,541
You monsters! Stop this!

22
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,291
We're not monsters, lady.

23
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,333
The Sibyl System is the monster.

24
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,250
Some program makes
its judgement on us,

25
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,083
then we're damned for
the rest of our lives.

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,791
No decent job.
No hope for the future.

27
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,125
Since the system
decided to bless you.

28
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,291
you wouldn't understand
what that's like, would ya?

29
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,708
Hey, What's your problem, man?

30
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,875
We saw you earlier.

31
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,541
You were wearing one
of those helmets.

32
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,250
So you think you can run around
causing all kinds of chaos,

33
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,583
and then just take off
that helmet and pretend

34
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,791
you've got no idea
about what's going on?

35
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,333
No. You've got it wrong!

36
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,041
Please, if you don't
believe me, just check my Hue--

37
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,041
Thanks to you
damn helmet people,

38
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,291
the Area Stress level is
shooting through the roof now!

39
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:25,500
We won't let you drag
us all into this mess!

40
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,416
So you're sure our
own Crime Coefficients

41
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,208
won't go up
'cause of this, right?

42
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,291
Yeah don't worry,

43
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,750
I saw something
online about it earlier,

44
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,833
it said if you're
acting in self-defense

45
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,250
or you're hurting a criminal,

46
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,166
then your Crime Coefficient
will actually go down.

47
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,958
An hour ago it was dozens.

48
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,750
It's several hundred cases now.

49
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,375
It keeps on climbing.

50
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,791
It's like a contagion.

51
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,250
I can't believe
the psycho-hazard

52
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708
has gotten this big.

53
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,250
I don't think
psycho-hazard covers it.

54
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,458
We're looking at a full-on riot.

55
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,083
The Area Stress
Level is skyrocketing.

56
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,666
At this point it's not just

57
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,083
people in helmets
who are rampaging.

58
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
We've got terrified
citizens committing

59
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,791
mass violence
all over the place.

60
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,375
Chief Kasei just issued
an emergency summons.

61
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,833
She's calling in
all CID personnel,

62
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,625
whether on duty or not.

63
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
Do you feel restless?

64
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:48,291
Yeah, of course.
Who wouldn't in this situation?

65
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,000
We have no idea what kind of
future's waiting for us.

66
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,750
Or what's gonna
happen to this city now?

67
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,875
You can be rather normal
in the ways you act,

68
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,666
and the things you like.

69
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,750
I appreciate that side of you.

70
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,666
I think we're both
essentially ordinary people.

71
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,541
I've never thought of myself
as having champagne taste.

72
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,416
I like a simple world
where common things

73
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
are done in common ways.

74
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,416
I suppose you could say
that I'm a man of the people.

75
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,416
We are ordinary, it's true.

76
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
And that's why
we're doing all this.

77
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
It's this town
that isn't normal.

78
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,708
Yes, this abnormal town.

79
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,750
How should I put it?

80
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,083
This city is like a parody
of the sort of the novels

81
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,166
I used to read
when I was younger.

82
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,541
Oh yeah, what kind?

83
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,000
Like a William Gibson book?

84
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,166
More like Phillip K. Dick.

85
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,750
Not as controlling as the
societies George Orwell

86
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,083
depicted in his work,

87
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,916
and not quite as wild as
those in Gibson's, either.

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,375
Phillip K. Dick, huh?
Never read him.

89
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,958
So if I want to check him out,
what should I read first?

90
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,250
Do Androids Dream
of Electric Sheep?

91
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,833
It's a classic.

92
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,416
There's an old movie
based on that, isn't there?

93
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,125
The content's quite different.

94
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,666
You should compare them
when you have time some day.

95
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,625
Then I'll go ahead and
download it right now.

96
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,125
No. Find the paperback.

97
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,916
E-books lack character.

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,791
Got all the same
words, don't they?

99
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,750
Physical books are more
than the words they contain.

100
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,000
They're also tools to
stimulate your senses

101
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,583
and adjust your thinking.

102
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,083
How do you mean?

103
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,291
When I don't feel well
I'll stare at a page forever

104
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,291
before realizing
I haven't absorbed a word.

105
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,000
When that happens,
I try to understand why.

106
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,666
What's gotten in my way?

107
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,208
On the other hand
there are books

108
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,791
I can take in effortlessly,
no matter how awful I'm feeling.

109
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,291
Why do those books draw me in?

110
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,666
I think it may be a
sort of mental tuning.

111
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,291
It's the feeling of the
paper against my fingers,

112
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,166
that familiar smell
of pulp and glue,

113
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,041
the momentary stimulation to
my brain when I turn each page.

114
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,083
These sensations regulate
and focus my brain.

115
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,000
They make it work better.

116
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,875
Well that's discouraging.

117
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,250
Hm?

118
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,833
Why is it every time
I talk to you I leave feeling

119
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,375
like there's something
I've been missing out

120
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,333
on my whole life up to now?

121
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,791
That's just silly.

122
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,708
I sure hope so.

123
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,333
It's almost time.

124
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,458
Should we head out?

125
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,458
I must say I'm surprised.

126
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,416
Why?

127
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,708
It seems too good to be true

128
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,833
that an outstanding
hacker would like Gibson.

129
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,625
The Metropolitan area is now
facing an unprecedented crisis.

130
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,875
Ever since the introduction
of the Sibyl System,

131
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,166
it has been assumed

132
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,458
that mass civilian rioting
would be impossible.

133
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,583
Because of that assumption,

134
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,833
the MWPSB has
neither the personnel

135
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,375
nor the equipment to
efficiently suppress a mob.

136
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,666
We've been blessed
with peace for too long.

137
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,833
Our technicians are
currently working to update

138
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,125
the border security Drones
with non-lethal weapons,

139
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,375
but that will take time,
and the situation

140
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,416
on the ground demands
immediate action.

141
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Until a full-fledged
suppression unit is completed,

142
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,041
we have no choice but
to have those of you

143
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,083
at the CID act as our
last remaining shield.

144
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,083
It will be up to you
to keep our citizens safe.

145
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,458
The cymatic scan blocking
helmets that have made

146
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,916
their way into the populace
prevent the Dominator's system

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
from functioning,
which means the stun baton

148
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,041
is our best weapon against
individuals wearing these.

149
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,125
For confrontations
with large crowds,

150
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,916
I'm authorizing the
use of our emergency

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,458
electromagnetic pulse grenades.

152
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,000
Once the surge current
shuts down the helmets,

153
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,041
you can use your Dominators
for normal enforcement action.

154
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,791
But be careful.

155
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,583
If the electromagnetic pulse
from a grenade is generated

156
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,000
in the wrong place,

157
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,916
city functions could
be disabled, too,

158
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,625
which will only increase unrest
and make our job even harder.

159
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,458
How many of these
grenades do we have?

160
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,791
Not very many.

161
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,458
If the number in our
inventory's accurate,

162
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,375
enough to give each
officer in this room two.

163
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,000
You'll be assembling
into teams of three.

164
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,666
Each team will
be assigned an area,

165
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,750
where you'll suppress
the riots, block by block.

166
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,958
The work will be
time-consuming and dangerous

167
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,166
but it's the
only option we have.

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,166
The future of this
city is at stake.

169
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,333
I'm counting on you all.

170
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,500
I knew it was going
to be dangerous,

171
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,750
walking this path with you.

172
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,208
And yet you never felt
like turning back, did you?

173
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,416
'Cause of the Sibyl System.

174
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,125
This society thinks we're mad.

175
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,708
I say people who are perfectly
happy entrusting their lives

176
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,666
to some nonsense
program are the ones

177
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,541
who need their heads checked.

178
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm a foreigner.

179
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,708
I'm grateful I've been able
to live in this country at all.

180
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,208
At least, that's
what I'd like to say.

181
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,125
But you put it best,
Mr. Makishima.

182
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,875
We just want the chance to do
common things in a common way.

183
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,208
I was born and raised here
so it's much more personal.

184
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,375
This is the only home I know.

185
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,208
These men are believers.

186
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,500
They want to see

187
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,875
what lies beyond the
destruction you'll cause.

188
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,375
That's the pressing
question, isn't it.

189
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,083
If there is something
past this good.

190
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,500
If not, I'll accept that, too.

191
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,250
How's the information
doctoring going?

192
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,750
The AI program
I set up is already at work.

193
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,958
Makishima's outdone
himself this time.

194
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,291
Now hold on.

195
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
We haven't found
conclusive evidence

196
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,541
that Makishima has anything
to do with these helmets.

197
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,500
Right now that's only a theory.

198
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,541
Come on, think about it.

199
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,291
If any normal
person in this city

200
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,583
even considered making equipment
to bypass the Sibyl System,

201
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,000
their Hue would get
clouded immediately.

202
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,041
And yet someone
was able to design,

203
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,583
mass produce, and
distribute these things.

204
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,708
That must have taken months.

205
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,666
The ordering of parts.
The logistics.

206
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,500
There's no way to do all of that
while avoiding every scanner.

207
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,041
Only someone who
could slip right under

208
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,416
the Sibyl System's nose
without wearing that helmet

209
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,041
could make the helmet
in the first place.

210
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,000
Holy crap.

211
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,166
A mass psycho-hazard that

212
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,666
uses a blind spot in the
Sibyl System huh?

213
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,583
So that's what Makishima's
been working toward?

214
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,083
Doubtful.

215
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,166
What?

216
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,000
As unstable as that man is.

217
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,750
He's always searching
for some answer

218
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
through his criminal actions.

219
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,541
These riots are terrible,
but it's hard to believe

220
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,125
that this chaos is
his ultimate goal.

221
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,208
I agree with you, Inspector.

222
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,541
If he was just some nut-job

223
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,208
who found enjoyment in
watching a riot like this.

224
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,083
He'd be a whole
lot easier to catch.

225
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,208
Oh man. Things are bad
on the internet, too.

226
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,375
Looks like there are a whole lot

227
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,541
of false rumors mixed
in with the truth.

228
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,458
The media should be restrained,
not inciting panic.

229
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,666
But that wouldn't get
clicks now would it?

230
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,916
Look at some of these "The MWPSB
is killing people at random?"

231
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,625
We have to stop them!

232
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,416
Why don't you put
the pedal to the floor

233
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,250
and take out a bunch of
'em all at the same time.

234
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,375
I can't do that!

235
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,833
Really?

236
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,958
I thought it was a good idea.

237
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,958
What about that is good?

238
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,666
This is the MWPSB.

239
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,416
Stop this violence immediately!

240
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,666
Drop all weapons and
lay on your stomach

241
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,041
with your hands
behind your head!

242
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,958
Looks like force
is our only option.

243
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,625
Give 'em another warning.

244
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,500
I repeat, this is the MWPSB!

245
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,666
If you don't obey and
surrender immediately.

246
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,250
We'll use the Dominators.

247
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,916
Depending on your
Crime Coefficient,

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,416
you could lose your life.

249
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,958
This is your final warning!

250
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,000
Lay on your stomach with
your hands behind your head!

251
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,666
Damn it.

252
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,666
This is crap.

253
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,041
The helmet people are
the bad guys, not us.

254
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,333
We had to defend
ourselves since you

255
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,625
incompetent idiots let all these
helmets get out on the street.

256
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,000
And nobody else was helping us!

257
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,250
Shut your mouth!

258
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,500
That doesn't justify you
beating people to death!

259
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,416
What's wrong?

260
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,083
These people are victims, too.

261
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,083
Yeah. They're average citizens.

262
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,125
They wouldn't
have turned violent

263
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,750
if they hadn't been so afraid.

264
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,041
No, not them. All the
people in these helmets.

265
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,625
Yeah they broke the law.

266
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,666
But they won't stand a chance
of real justice with these mobs.

267
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,500
They'll be hunted like animals.

268
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,458
The masses won't
care who did what,

269
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,541
or the burden of proof.

270
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,083
They'll just want revenge.

271
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,750
They've been
whipped into a frenzy.

272
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,083
All those nasty false
rumors on the web

273
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,125
are making it a whole lot worse.

274
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,833
And I think Makishima's
been planting

275
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,250
those stories to
get what he wants.

276
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,541
Either the mastermind himself,
or his partner in crime.

277
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,958
We already know
that one of the two

278
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,958
is an extremely skilled hacker.

279
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,458
They couldn't have pulled off
those earlier stunts otherwise.

280
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,250
Look at the faces
of those people

281
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,291
who took off their
helmets and surrendered.

282
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,041
They're not hardened criminals.

283
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,333
They're trash
who found themselves

284
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,875
with a free pass to
get back at the world.

285
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,375
Makishima played
them like violins.

286
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,041
Wait. If you're
right about all this,

287
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,458
then the masks are just
the first part of his plan.

288
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,250
We should suppose
that everything

289
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
is going exactly as he wanted.

290
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,333
And that he predicted the
MWPSB's reaction as well.

291
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,583
Quick Inspector. Can you
bring up all the riot locations.

292
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,125
And which areas
we're focusing on first?

293
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,958
Hold on. Here we go.

294
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,541
Looks to me like a feint.

295
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,541
What if this thing
was pre-arranged

296
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,000
so that the riots would
intensify at those places just

297
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:41,166
to lure all the CID detectives
away from their real target?

298
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,208
If that's true. Oh no.

299
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,583
These past five years.

300
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,791
I've been trying
to grasp the truth

301
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,125
of the Sibyl System
and how it functions.

302
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,083
Distributed parallel
processing by servers

303
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,416
installed at various
locations around the city.

304
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,250
An ideal system of
redundancy and fault tolerance

305
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,500
that could withstand any danger.

306
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,416
Those are the catchphrases
the Ministry of Welfare

307
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,375
uses to praise
themselves in the press.

308
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,750
So I started dissecting
their claims.

309
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,500
Measuring and analyzing the
Psycho-Pass of every citizen

310
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,916
requires a great
deal of computation.

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,458
Naturally, it's not possible
to coordinate the tasks

312
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,250
over a large
network without some

313
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,708
sort of grid computing
and middleware.

314
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,750
But the more I investigated,

315
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,541
the more I realized the flow
of the data was clearly strange.

316
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,916
You have the scanners
throughout town,

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,083
the authorized counseling
AIs, and the Dominators.

318
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:45,041
At first the data appeared to be
processed throughout the grid,

319
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,416
but it was actually
just being passed

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,958
from one place to
another untouched.

321
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,625
All these processors
exchanging data,

322
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,375
but none of them actually
doing the processing.

323
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,791
Then I found something.

324
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,791
A single relay point
that every communication

325
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,625
goes through at least once.

326
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,916
If a stand-alone system
the public doesn't know

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,958
about is carefully hidden
at that relay point.

328
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,041
And that one secret
machine is managing

329
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,166
all of Sibyl's processing
and computation.

330
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,583
Then suddenly it makes sense.

331
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,291
I always knew you
were a genius, Choe.

332
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,416
Well, it makes sense
logically, that is.

333
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
But there are still a ton
of mysteries to unravel.

334
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,291
Like its capacity.

335
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,875
If it's really a
stand-alone system,

336
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,583
it's exhibiting a throughput
that's not possible

337
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,500
with existing technologies.

338
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,625
And then there's
the question of why.

339
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,916
From a security standpoint,

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,250
you wouldn't put
everything in one place.

341
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,708
It's too risky,
no matter how you slice it.

342
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,750
Unless they have a secret
so big they'd sooner have the

343
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,541
whole system collapse than let
the public discover the truth.

344
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,416
My thought exactly.

345
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,833
And that's just too
suspicious for me to resist.

346
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,000
When you know there's
something behind the curtain,

347
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,500
you have to look.

348
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,583
It's time to see what the
Sibyl System actually is.

349
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,666
So you tracked it
back to this facility.

350
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,583
Now I understand.

351
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,625
This is the common relay point

352
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,833
for every byte of data
collected by the cymatic scans.

353
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,208
Plus, there are clear traces

354
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,833
of the power consumption
in this area being faked.

355
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,375
I'm almost positive
that the Sibyl System

356
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,125
is in there somewhere,

357
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,750
inside the Ministry of
Welfare's Nona Tower.

358
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,125
Well. In that case.

359
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,583
What are you men waiting for?

360
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,666
Let's uncover the heart
of the Great Prophetess.

361
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,083
Inspector Ginoza!

362
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,416
We think his real goal is

363
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,791
to attack the Ministry of
Welfare's Nona Tower!

364
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
The riots are nothing
but a diversion!

365
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,958
Come on!

366
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,083
Are you telling me
you left your post

367
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,125
based on groundless speculation?

368
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,000
People's lives are at stake!

369
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,458
But with all the Inspectors
and Enforcers in the field,

370
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,916
the government district
in the Chuo Ward

371
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,875
has been left
completely undefended!

372
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,625
The guard Drones are
as good as scarecrows

373
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,541
against anyone
wearing those helmets!

374
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,875
Sir, if we're right about
this and we don't act quickly,

375
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,833
we won't have a second chance.

376
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,666
The damage could
be irreversible!

377
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,458
At least let me
see if we're right!

378
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,291
All right, go. Get there
first and check it out.

379
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,875
The rest of the teams will
continue suppressing

380
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,416
the riots as ordered.

381
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,000
If you find something there,
report back to me immediately.

382
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,458
Every second counts.

383
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes sir.

384
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,583
There it is.
