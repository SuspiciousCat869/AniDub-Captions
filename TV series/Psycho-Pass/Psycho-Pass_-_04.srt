1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,958
Our one rule in the Talisman
Saloon is that we're not here

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,708
to talk about ourselves,
only the affairs of others.

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,541
So careful with your phrasing,
okay, Lemonade Candy?

4
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,875
Okay. A friend of mine

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,000
has found herself in
quite the predicament,

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,416
so I'd like to get your thoughts
on her situation, Talisman.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,791
Well of course, I'd be
delighted. I'll do my best

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,750
to help this friend of yours.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,208
Tell me her situation
and we'll see

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,208
if I can't put the old
Talisman spin on things.

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,416
Yeah, Talisman!

12
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,500
Well, let's see... She recently
began a tough job right after

13
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:52,750
she graduated. A job with
a lot of responsibility.

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,291
But that's not the problem.

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,333
I know she doesn't regret
working there or anything.

16
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,458
Please continue.

17
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,541
The problem she's having stems
from one of her coworkers.

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,875
Well actually, he's more
of a senior colleague,

19
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,208
but he's ranked beneath her.

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,708
It's kind of tough to explain,

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,916
but they work together and
it's like she can't avoid him.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,750
He's an important part of
her carrying out her job.

23
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,208
And he's difficult to work with?
Is that the issue?

24
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,500
His behavior can be
pretty erratic at times.

25
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,416
The thing is, she also
feels like there are times

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,791
that he makes a lot of sense.

27
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,583
And so she started to believe

28
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,458
that she might be able to
trust him at some point.

29
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,833
That's always a nice thought,
but there is still

30
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,250
the likely possibility that it
is nothing but wishful thinking.

31
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,333
So you think she's
being unrealistic?

32
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,083
It sounds like she might want
him to be something he's not.

33
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,125
She needs to look past
her surface assumptions

34
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,500
to understand
his true character.

35
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,458
Why don't you give this
advice to your friend

36
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,208
and see if it makes
things easier for her?

37
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,708
Step forward and share
your troubles with me, Talisman.

38
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,750
The difficulties of those cast
adrift may seem hopeless

39
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,000
but the answers
are already there,

40
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,875
hiding within the
stories you have to tell.

41
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,875
So I don't understand
his true character, huh?

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,333
You wanna ask me
about Kogami, don't you?

43
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,416
How could you tell?

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,291
The way you seem to be connected
by fate, I'd be curious too.

45
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,916
I just wish I could wrap
my head around

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,958
how I should deal with him.

47
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
Someone told me I should
try to understand him

48
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,583
and then someone else told me

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,750
that I shouldn't
consider him a human.

50
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,416
I can guess that advice came
from Inspector Ginoza.

51
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,916
It works for him. Dogs are
dogs and owners are owners.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But ya break everything
down to its basic nature

53
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,250
and I think it might
be easier for you

54
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,125
if you just stuck
to your own side.

55
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,083
If you really wanna
understand, Kogami the only way

56
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,416
to do it is to see
things the way he does

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,208
and think like he does.

58
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,375
And if you can manage
to accomplish that,

59
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,125
you'll find yourself
in the dog pound with us.

60
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:03,041
Your Pyscho-Pass will have a
reading identical to Kogami's.

61
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:10,833
"Gaze into the abyss and the
abyss also gazes into you."

62
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,916
Just ask Kogami. He stared
into the darkness too long.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,166
So long that I don't think
he knows how to look away.

64
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,958
I get the impression that he's
convinced the only place justice

65
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,416
actually exists is within
the depths of that darkness.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,208
If you really feel so
compelled to dive in after him,

67
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,500
well, that's
completely up to you.

68
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,000
There's nothing I could
say to change your mind.

69
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,250
I can't stop you if that's
what you really want.

70
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,625
I couldn't stop Ko, either.

71
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
Is that what...?

72
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,333
Something happen?

73
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,958
Looks like it.

74
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,958
Well I'm off duty now,
same with Kunizuka.

75
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,333
Kogami and Kagari
should be around.

76
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,208
So, What's the situation?

77
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,833
We got weird results from
the home security test.

78
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,041
The toilet in this
apartment has apparently

79
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,958
been broken for
the past two months.

80
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,041
And yet the tenant hasn't
filed a single complaint.

81
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,333
So the management
company got suspicious

82
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,416
and reported it to us.

83
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,041
Kimihiko Hayama 32 years old,
single, and unemployed.

84
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,708
He's unemployed?
In this day and age?

85
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,625
How is that even possible?

86
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,708
I checked the
records from his bank.

87
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,250
He was sponsored by an
affiliate service provider

88
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,416
and he was rather
well compensated.

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,291
Enough so that I'm positive
he lives in great comfort.

90
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,416
What a sweet deal.

91
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,916
Sit at home and get super paid
for being popular on the net.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,791
Why the hell would you
want a straight job?

93
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,708
Only a chump would
turn that down.

94
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,291
Could he just be on an
extended trip somewhere?

95
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,625
Not possible. Not with
all the street scanners.

96
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,083
We would have a tracking
record of his movements.

97
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,708
There's no way a person
can get out of this city

98
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,375
without leaving some
kind of trace to follow.

99
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,166
Besides, his bank
account doesn't show

100
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,625
any activity for
the past two months.

101
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,791
This is easy. He's dead.

102
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,625
Clearly.

103
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,833
It's more difficult to
disappear than to get killed.

104
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,666
It's still too soon to
land on that conclusion.

105
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,708
Can we pull up the last interior
holo design for this room?

106
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,416
Hold on a sec.

107
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,583
What? Why's this

108
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,416
We all know you can't sit
on a hologram the whole point

109
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,791
of the holography design is to
line it up with the real couch.

110
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,500
To state the obvious: That
couch was over there originally,

111
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,583
but somebody had
a reason to move it.

112
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,375
Yeah, good call.

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,583
I think it's safe to say
they were trying to hide that.

114
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,083
Why worry about such
a small scratch.

115
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,750
Have one of the
Crime Lab Drones scan it.

116
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,250
Yep. Leftover
adhesive from tape.

117
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,708
And what does that mean?

118
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,708
That's the big reveal to
the magic trick they pulled.

119
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,416
The wand they used to
make Hayama disappear.

120
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,041
Of course they had
to murder him first,

121
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,375
probably poisoning or
strangling, something clean.

122
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,000
Some kind of bloodless
method to avoid any evidence.

123
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,791
Then they taped
down a plastic sheet,

124
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,500
and went to work
dismantling the body.

125
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,625
Chopped him up enough
to flush the pieces,

126
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,541
which probably
busted the toilet.

127
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,666
Hayama must've put up a fight
when they tried to kill him.

128
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,625
The struggle left the scratch
and the adhesive residue

129
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,541
is obviously left over from
when they taped the sheet down.

130
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,583
They're determined,
I'll give 'em that,

131
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,041
but it's an amateur job.

132
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,291
It can't be.

133
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,708
Bring in old Masaoka
if you don't believe me.

134
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,958
He would've sniffed it out
the moment he walked in here.

135
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,166
Trust me.

136
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,750
Can't fool a hunting
dog's sense of smell.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,916
Let's check the plumbing
for any traces of blood.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,791
We'll discuss more after that.

139
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,041
Alright then

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,708
Okay, it's open.

141
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,750
This is the online avatar
Hayama was using? Talisman?

142
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,000
The dude must've had a
pretty large fan base.

143
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,208
That's really the only way

144
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,708
you can make serious
money as an affiliate.

145
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,041
Talisman?

146
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,458
Y'know it?

147
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,208
Kind of... Yeah.

148
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,666
I spoke with him for the
first time just this morning.

149
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,250
Technology to the rescue.

150
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,666
Our precious Crime Lab Drones

151
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,041
have practically
built this case for you.

152
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,208
They managed to find the
remains of Hayama's body

153
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,208
scattered throughout the
sewers beneath his apartment.

154
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,083
A round of applause please.

155
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,916
So the guy's in countless
pieces but his CommuField

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,750
is still active and someone is
obviously posing as his avatar.

157
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,666
You got it.

158
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
S'like a horror movie.

159
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,333
A ghost haunting the forums
and chat rooms of the Internet.

160
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,375
I'd watch it.

161
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,666
So someone's
claimed his identity?

162
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
I'm really not sure.

163
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
It seems that way, but he was
apparently screwing around

164
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,500
with fake IPs back
before he went missing.

165
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,625
What about tracking
the access routes?

166
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,250
I don't know, but it's
worth giving it a shot.

167
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,375
It's tricky though, because
they're all running through

168
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,833
a variety of high
security proxy servers.

169
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,958
They've got all sorts
of paranoid measures

170
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,583
in place to hide their
client's footsteps.

171
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,291
We've gotta track 'em carefully,
or they'll notice us.

172
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,333
But luckily it
won't go past them.

173
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,666
They'll relocate the route
but they won't report it

174
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,625
so whoever's using
his avatar won't realize

175
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,750
they've aroused suspicion.

176
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,958
And that should give us
a fighting chance.

177
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,541
The suspect...

178
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,750
He doesn't even feel there's a
need to hide out and try to run.

179
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,375
He's practically walking
around beneath our noses.

180
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,625
If we play our cards
right we could very likely

181
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,166
get him to drop some clues
as to his real identity.

182
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,333
Right. Well let's hunt
down Hayama's avatar.

183
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,791
Making contact's a good
idea, but who does it?

184
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,166
Interesting.

185
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,791
This impostor's been
posing as him for two months

186
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,500
Running the Talisman
CommuField just as capably

187
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,416
as the real owner this whole
time and nobody's noticed.

188
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,541
Mister Ginoza, that's him.

189
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,541
Looks like he's heading off to
check out another CommuField.

190
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,666
Okay Let's follow.

191
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh, yeah, this is Spooky
Boogie's CommuField.

192
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,375
This is a pretty
big community too.

193
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,333
Spooky Boogie!

194
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,916
We love you, Spooky!

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,750
You're the best, Spooky!

196
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,833
Woo, Spooky!

197
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,875
We've gotta be careful in here.

198
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,583
Spooky Boogie's notorious
for being an anarchist.

199
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,291
It could mean trouble if she
finds out we're detectives.

200
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,166
Good to know.

201
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
Does she have any
connections with Talisman?

202
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,166
Maybe. They're both
pretty famous,

203
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,583
although, that doesn't

204
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,083
necessarily mean they
know each other in real life.

205
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,791
Let's check their access logs

206
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,416
we can track their
visitations that way.

207
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,333
If they frequent each other's
CommuFields, then-Tsunemori?

208
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,750
What the... Ginoza?

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,458
Hello, there,
Miss Lemonade Candy.

210
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,541
I'm the hostess of this fabulous
CommuField, Spooky Boogie.

211
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,916
You're such an
unexpected visitor.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,916
I had to invite
you to my chat room.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,833
I hope it's not
an inconvenience.

214
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,041
Uh, no, it's not but
I'm curious, why me?

215
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,958
I've heard intriguing rumors.

216
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,083
That look on your face,
you really have no idea

217
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,666
just how famous you are,
do you, Lemonade Candy?

218
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,000
You are.

219
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,375
And I'm quite the fan
of yours, Akane Tsunemori.

220
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,750
How... Who are you?

221
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,833
Well If you really
want to figure that out,

222
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,208
you could start by scouring

223
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,958
the pages of your
old graduation album.

224
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,333
And if you guess who I am

225
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,916
I'll buy you a drink at
our next class reunion.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,083
So, I can't help but
wonder why an Inspector

227
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,666
with the CID is
scoping out my CommuField.

228
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,541
I've got a funny feeling you
didn't just drop by to hang out.

229
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,833
So uhh.

230
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,791
I mean... Do you regularly
speak with Talisman?

231
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
Yeah, I have to.

232
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,500
We're rivals in the access
ranking, it'd be foolish not to.

233
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,291
Have you noticed anything
different about him?

234
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,958
Anything odd with his
avatar or his field?

235
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,250
Like, sometime within the
past several months or so?

236
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,541
Let's see.

237
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,250
Nothing that really
comes to mind as of late,

238
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,916
but there was a period
of time about, yeah,

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,958
it was about two months ago
he was acting strangely.

240
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,625
What? How exactly?

241
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,958
There were a couple of
things that really stood out.

242
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,166
He was speaking erratically
and he kept holding events

243
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,791
that were clearly intended
to get affiliate money.

244
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,583
It was fuel on the fire
for the Talisman haters.

245
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,041
He rubbed enough
people the wrong way

246
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,166
that it started to look
like the old timer avatar

247
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
was gonna have to call it quits.

248
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,958
But he bounced back.

249
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,916
You said he's not like that now?

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,458
Yep. He's back to his usual cool
and mellow self these days.

251
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,291
He's gone on record
and publically apologized

252
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,083
for his behavior.

253
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,833
It's pretty tough
for an avatar who went

254
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,666
into such a drastic decline to
make a full comeback, though.

255
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,541
So are you doing an official
investigation into him?

256
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,666
Did Talisman do something wrong?

257
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,875
I can't really talk
about the details.

258
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,791
It's complicated though we
need to physically track down

259
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,958
and locate him.

260
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,833
the person behind
the avatar, I mean.

261
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,125
That's kind of intriguing.

262
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,791
I'd be happy to offer
you some assistance.

263
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,458
What?

264
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,208
A PSB beaureacrat in debt

265
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,333
to little ol' me could
come in handy.

266
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,500
Infamous anarchist Spooky
Boogie working with the law.

267
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,916
Wasn't expecting that.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,708
That's just part of my
public persona and besides,

269
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,833
we were classmates,
just leave this to me, okay?

270
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,250
Your attention please,
my dear and loyal guests.

271
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,458
To show my appreciation
for your support,

272
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,750
for all your love, and
for visiting my forum,

273
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,083
I'd like to invite you all

274
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,583
to a modest yet grand
party held in your honor.

275
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,125
It'll be a meetup in
Roppongi on the fourth.

276
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,083
In addition, I will challenge
my friend Talisman to a duel.

277
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,625
A chance to win the
White Crown I currently hold.

278
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,416
I hope to see all of you there.

279
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,791
A meet-up?

280
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,916
That's right
CommuField users gather

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,875
somewhat regularly for parties.

282
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,541
They wear Holo-Cosplay
that simulates their

283
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,958
online social avatars
It's completely anonymous.

284
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,916
The modern version
of a masquerade ball.

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,791
Alright, but the big question:

286
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,666
How can we be certain that
Talisman will actually show up?

287
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,291
He can't afford not to.

288
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,000
His popularity will
plummet if he backs out.

289
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,125
Whoever's been posing
as Hayama's avatar,

290
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,166
they've got no
choice but to be there.

291
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,458
They've already put
so much effort

292
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,041
into making sure his
CommuField runs smoothly.

293
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,875
They've gotta
show at this meet-up

294
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,083
if they don't wanna squander all
the work they've put into it.

295
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,375
He can't hide behind
his Holo-Cosplay.

296
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
The only thing we have

297
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,166
to do is get him in the
Dominator's sights

298
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,916
and his Crime Coefficient
is bound to give him away.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,666
Right. Where's the meet-up?

300
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,125
At a club in Roppongi, Exoset.

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,250
Ginoza's team is on
the front entrance

302
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,375
and the drones are
positioned out back.

303
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,250
All we've gotta do is stand
back and wait for him to show.

304
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,708
I take back that masquerade
ball comment I made earlier.

305
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,500
It's a hell of a
lot weirder than that.

306
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,666
They're packed like
cigarettes into a place

307
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,541
with only two exits and
they don't even know

308
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,208
who's standing next to them.

309
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
How can they be
comfortable with this?

310
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,125
It's impossible to participate
in the social networks

311
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,541
if you're afraid of anonymity.

312
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,375
But this isn't virtual.

313
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,541
You can bleed and die in
here and any one of these

314
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,125
costumed freaks could be
carrying a knife on them.

315
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,875
And they're fine
with putting their lives

316
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,500
into the hands of strangers.

317
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,791
They're out of their
damn minds if you ask me.

318
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,041
That kind of thinking is exactly

319
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,416
what causes your
Pycho-Pass to get so cloudy.

320
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,166
Sorry, that was rude.
It came out the wrong way.

321
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,166
It's okay.
That's a legitimate point.

322
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,083
Take a look. It's him.

323
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,208
We can't get a read from here
Too many guests to clearly aim.

324
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,583
I'm gonna try to
get closer to him.

325
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Dominator Suppression
System Online.

326
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,000
No way.

327
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,666
Now would I lie to you?

328
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,125
Well, crap I knew it.

329
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,916
Mr. Mido? You were
right on the money.

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,583
A Dominator was just
detected out on the floor.

331
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,666
There's definitely an
Inspector here. No doubt.

332
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,958
So it really is a trap.
Damn Spooky Boogie.

333
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,958
You better get out of
there while you can.

334
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,833
It'll royally muck things
up if you get caught.

335
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,208
I'm aware of that.

336
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,416
I've also got
unfinished business.

337
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,041
I'll help you get out.

338
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,000
Shit! What the
hell just happened?

339
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,916
Someone hacked all
the Holo-Cosplay!

340
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,625
The suspect's gonna run!

341
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,416
Dammit! Pull your Dominator.

342
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,291
We'll root him out by
his Crime Coefficient.

343
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,166
It's the CID!

344
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,958
Wait!

345
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,250
Crime Coefficient Over one-ten.

346
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,541
Over one-forty.
Target for enforcement action.

347
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,541
Crap, how many of 'em are there?

348
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,041
This went from covert
to full-blown raid.

349
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
Well this is great.

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,333
They spotted us.

351
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,458
Oh! Sorry!

352
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,625
What the hell were you trying
to pull with this meet-up?

353
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,708
My boyfriend got
busted by the MWPSB!

354
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,458
Are you gonna pay
for his treatment?

355
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,875
Please! Everyone just calm down!

356
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,666
I had nothing
to do with this raid!

357
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,125
I'm just as upset
about it as you are!

358
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,833
We can see right through
your lies, Spooky Boogie.

359
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,333
Judging by the way it went down

360
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,875
they must've been in the club
before the party started.

361
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,458
The only way that
could happen was

362
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,583
if the organizer was in on it.

363
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,416
You've always touted anarchism
as your guiding principle.

364
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,250
One of the reasons so many
love you and yet you've colluded

365
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,916
with the government
against your own followers.

366
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,833
A truly unacceptable offense.

367
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,750
Wha- That is not true!

368
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,000
From the way it looked to me,

369
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,250
you're the one they
were after, Talisman.

370
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,625
So if anyone's at
fault here, it's you!

371
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,500
You've betrayed your fans,
as well as your own character.

372
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,625
You have no right to call
yourself Spooky Boogie

373
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,666
and you certainly no
longer deserve the trust

374
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,666
and adoration of our community.

375
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,083
You... You have no right to say
that, you don't know anything!

376
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,875
I know more about you than you
could ever know about yourself.

377
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,541
Shut up, you creep!

378
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,916
What's his problem?
Talk about creepy.

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Just who the hell
does he think he is?

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,625
I'm putting a block on
his access to my CommuField.

381
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,333
Screw that. He won't get
anywhere near me again.

382
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,666
There's really no point in that.

383
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,333
It's no longer your forum.

384
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,583
And Spooky Boogie is no
longer your avatar, either.

385
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,750
Did you kill her?

386
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,958
This woman had no right to carry
on acting as Spooky Boogie.

387
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,875
But Spooky Boogie shouldn't
vanish from the net.

388
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,916
She puts a smile
on so many faces.

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,208
With a little bit of crowd work,
Spooky Boogie can still be used.

390
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,666
The woman behind
her can be flushed.

391
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,125
Sure, I bet you'll make
a great Spooky Boogie.

392
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,375
Even better than
Shoko Sugawara herself.

393
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,166
Just look at what
you've done with Talisman.

394
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,833
You're leaps and bounds
better than Hayama.
