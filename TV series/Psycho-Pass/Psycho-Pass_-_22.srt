1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,083
Beneath all of your bullshit you
just couldn't bear the solitude.

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,291
Really, who isn't alone in this
society we've constructed?

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,500
In this world where we're
watched over by the system

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,791
and live by its standards, a
community is no longer needed.

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,208
It's not even relevant.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,916
We all live in our own little
cell, and the system tames us

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,708
by giving each of us
our personal serenity.

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,791
You're the same, aren't you?
Shinya Kogami?

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,541
No one accepted your justice.

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,166
Or understood your anger.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,041
So you turned your back
on trust, and friendships.

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,958
You even abandoned
the only remaining place

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,541
that would tolerate you.

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,458
All so you could come this far.

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,666
Reach this moment where
you know you truly belong.

16
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,875
After all that? You try
to laugh at my solitude?

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,750
But I see you.
I value that trait.

18
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,166
He who doesn't fear solitude.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,041
He who can turn
it into a weapon.

20
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,125
You never learn, do you,
Kogami? It's a shame.

21
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,333
Hold it right there.

22
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,916
Please, Kogami.

23
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,541
You need to drop the blade.

24
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,541
You realize that was
Makishima, right?

25
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,250
Yeah, I know.
I'll take care of him, also.

26
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,500
You gonna shoulder
all this yourself?

27
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,875
Handcuff me and go
after him on your own?

28
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,416
Surely you know I'm not
that reckless don't you?

29
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,125
This Dominator is
locked in Paralyzer mode,

30
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,208
with the safety unlocked.

31
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,541
So you should be
able to use it, too.

32
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,375
Let's do this together.

33
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,166
We're going to paralyze
Makishima and bring him in.

34
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,833
I'm not going to let
you do anything more.

35
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,041
Try and I'll blow out your leg.

36
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,125
I'm surprised.

37
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,500
I always thought this job
would make you tougher.

38
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,041
But I guess I figured
you'd still be nice about it.

39
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,541
You're trying not to kill
Makishima, no matter what. Why?

40
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,875
Because it's illegal,
and I can't overlook a crime.

41
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,625
Why are you going
so far to obey a law

42
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,250
that can neither
judge a criminal,

43
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,083
nor protect the
people from his wrath?

44
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,375
The law doesn't protect people.
People protect the law.

45
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,916
Humans have always
fought against evil,

46
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,666
and sought out a righteous
way of living as a group.

47
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,083
Those feelings the accumulation

48
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,791
of society's
feelings are the law.

49
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,916
They aren't just provisions,
or arbitrary rules.

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,958
They're the fragile
and irreplaceable ideals

51
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,333
we all carry in the deepest
recesses of our hearts.

52
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,208
Compared to the power
of anger and hatred,

53
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,500
they're something that
can easily be broken down.

54
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,916
People have prayed for a better
world since the dawn of time,

55
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,375
hoped for a better future,

56
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,958
sacrificed their own
freedoms for its sake.

57
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,250
In order for those
prayers to hold meaning,

58
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,500
we have to protect the law,

59
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,791
that promise of a better
world to the very end.

60
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,666
We can't just give up
on it because it's flawed.

61
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,625
If there ever comes a
time when everyone feels

62
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,333
the way you do,
the Sibyl System will disappear.

63
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,458
There won't be any latent
criminals, or Enforcers.

64
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,875
Because there won't
be any need for them.

65
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,166
But until then...

66
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,125
Akane!

67
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,833
I do wish you people
would stop insulting us

68
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,541
with your so-called efforts.
You're in our way.

69
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,333
Interesting.

70
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,083
That's fate.

71
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,416
No. Don't do it. Please.

72
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,041
This is between him and me now.

73
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,250
Kogami wait!

74
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,958
Everyone is alone.
Everyone's empty.

75
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,125
We don't really need
each other anymore.

76
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,666
With so much at our fingertips,

77
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,375
we can find a
spare for any talent.

78
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,041
Any item, any piece of
knowledge, any relationship

79
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,833
can be replaced with a
simple search and a click...

80
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,541
I'd become bored of
a world like that.

81
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,916
But for some reason.

82
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,916
Some feeling I can't explain.

83
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,666
The thought that someone
other than you might kill me.

84
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,041
That never even crossed my mind.

85
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,916
Tell me. What do
you think Kogami?

86
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,083
Once this is done will you
find a replacement for me?

87
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,083
I don't know.
I sure as hell hope not.

88
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,208
They must've realized
it the moment

89
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,333
they first laid eyes
on one another.

90
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,416
Realized that long
before they had ever met.

91
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Destiny had planned
this encounter.

92
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,666
They were not two
ships passing in the night.

93
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,916
They weren't mysteries
that couldn't be explained.

94
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,458
They understood
each other better

95
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,041
than they understood themselves.

96
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,958
Their focus was solely
reserved for the other.

97
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,833
Kogami.

98
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,625
The outcome of the attempt

99
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,250
to capture Shogo Makishima
was quite regrettable.

100
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,125
So does that mean the
system is done with me now?

101
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,458
We have no choice but
to lower our evaluation

102
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,958
of your abilities, and
alter our expectations.

103
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,791
However, that does
not mean the value

104
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,125
of your existence
turns negative.

105
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,791
To the contrary, when it
comes to the macro-management

106
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,500
of the Sibyl System,

107
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,833
you remain an individual
of outstanding value.

108
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,833
Your role has simply changed.

109
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,625
And what's that mean?

110
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,666
You have a strong and
healthy Psycho-Pass,

111
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,416
combined with a clear mind
and superior judgment.

112
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,750
These qualities make
you as close to ideal

113
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,708
as can be expected
from an individual human.

114
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,041
You will serve as an example to
the citizens of the coming era.

115
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
Furthermore, you possess
an emotional antipathy

116
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,916
completely contrary
to your theoretical

117
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,125
assessment
of the Sibyl System.

118
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,375
This internal conflict has only
intensified after recent events,

119
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,125
making you an invaluable
subject for field research.

120
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,666
If we can establish a means
of winning you over to our side,

121
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,250
we will obtain crucial sample
data which will help us

122
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,875
take the governance of
society to the next phase.

123
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,125
What are you planning?

124
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,416
Due to current public
opinion, the true nature

125
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,916
of the Sibyl System must
be kept completely secret

126
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
from the masses.

127
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,458
While many safeguards are in
place to ensure that secrecy,

128
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,000
exposure of the truth remains
the most statistically

129
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,750
significant danger
to our stewardship.

130
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,333
In the short term,
this is a necessary risk.

131
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,500
But in the long term, this
strategy is not desirable.

132
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,333
To achieve maximum stability,

133
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,625
we should eventually
lift the curtain,

134
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,833
and make our true nature known,

135
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,666
thereby creating an environment
where every citizen enjoys

136
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,166
and accepts our governance with
full knowledge of what we are.

137
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,791
Only this can
solidify the health

138
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,666
and prosperity of
future human society.

139
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,416
But the individual human
mind is unpredictable.

140
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,833
To succeed at this transition,
further research is required.

141
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,625
Continuing to observe
and analyze your behavior

142
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,625
will provide us
with key insights

143
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,708
on how to build a
methodology for winning over

144
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,166
future citizens, and adapting
them to our system.

145
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,000
In short, we must
learn how to persuade.

146
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,583
You think you can control us?

147
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,666
As long as you don't
show any signs

148
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,666
of jeopardizing
our secret,

149
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,958
your life and your freedom
of action will be guaranteed.

150
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,875
We hope you will cooperate.

151
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,583
If you follow the root
instinct of self-preservation,

152
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,666
there is only one
choice you can make.

153
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,916
You're right. I don't
want to die in vain.

154
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,791
And I don't want to bring chaos
to a people that aren't ready.

155
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,333
Shutting down Sibyl now would
cause our society to collapse.

156
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,458
Knowing your mind, we believe
we can trust in your respect

157
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,458
for the law when you make
your future decisions.

158
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,291
Laws are a
man-made construction.

159
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,625
An agreement we all make

160
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,083
with each other in the
hope of a better life.

161
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
Enforcing laws
unworthy of protection

162
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,083
is a betrayal of that pact.

163
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,750
A shaming of that hope.

164
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,041
You shouldn't
underestimate humans.

165
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,750
We're always striving
for a better society

166
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,375
that meets our ideals.

167
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,250
And one day someone is
going to find that better way

168
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,500
and when they do.

169
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,916
They'll march into this
room and shut you down.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,833
The Sibyl System has no future.

171
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,750
You're on borrowed--
no. Stolen time.

172
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,583
Your passion pleases us,
Akane Tsunemori.

173
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:47,875
Fight. Struggle. Only that
will help us to evolve.

174
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,875
Hey. It's been a while.

175
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,416
I came to see you today

176
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,708
because I decided what
I'm going to do next.

177
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,041
My Crime Coefficient is up
to a hundred and forty now.

178
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,333
They say there's no longer
a chance of recovery,

179
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,833
but as you know, it's not
in my nature to sit around

180
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,416
and mope in the
isolation facility.

181
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,583
So instead. I'm going
back to the PSB.

182
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,041
I know how much you wanted me
to take a different path.

183
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,708
And now that I've fallen
that dream is dead.

184
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm guess I'm just a
bad son in every way.

185
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,958
But strangely enough,
I don't have any regrets.

186
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,291
Nothing's good about
living as a hound.

187
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,750
It's brutal work.

188
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,208
But it's necessary and some
poor fools have to do it.

189
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,875
That's us. Right, Dad?

190
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,291
All right.
Sorry for the trouble.

191
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,708
Not at all. It's part of my
job to chaperone Enforcers.

192
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,708
You taught me
that from the start.

193
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,833
At least my Dad got a grave,

194
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,375
I can't say the same
thing about Kagari.

195
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,833
Division Two's search.
They were told to stop right?

196
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,583
Yes.

197
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,250
I'm sure he was killed.

198
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,375
The top brass must know that.

199
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,791
But they want to sweep

200
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,583
any evidence they
have under the rug.

201
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,875
It's not the kind of thing
they'd want to go public.

202
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,666
And Mister Kogami.
I wonder where he is now.

203
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,750
When you take the collar off

204
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,083
a hunting dog as wild as he was.

205
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
Well then he's not much
different than a wolf.

206
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
And now that he's
out in the wilderness.

207
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,291
He may actually
enjoy his new life.

208
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,583
How could he? When he's
living as a fugitive.

209
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,250
I bet he's happier
running for his life

210
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,041
than living under lock
and key as an Enforcer.

211
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,708
He's a survivor. A cunning man.

212
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,500
Who never knew
when to call it quits.

213
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,166
No matter how bad the situation,

214
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,625
he'll always find a
way to pull through.

215
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,250
Wherever he is,
I think he'll be fine.

216
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,666
To be honest, Inspector, the one
I'm more worried about is you.

217
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,666
Are you serious?

218
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,458
Not everything's
changed, Mr. Ginoza.

219
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,666
You're still a worrier.

220
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,708
I'd rather not talk
about the old days.

221
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,958
Let's stick to the future.

222
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,708
A new Inspector's
being assigned?

223
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,541
That's right,
and she's a minor, too.

224
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,291
That's pretty unusual isn't it?

225
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:22,000
Well we're partially
responsible for her recruitment.

226
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,916
This is trivial and
none of my business,

227
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,291
but do you mind if I ask?

228
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,625
What?

229
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,750
Your glasses.
Did you wear them for show?

230
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,916
I never liked how
my face looked.

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,208
Especially my eyes.

232
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,500
But things I used to care about
don't seem to matter much now.

233
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,708
Division One has undergone
quite the sea change, hasn't it?

234
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,750
Shu. Masa. Shinya.
They're all gone.

235
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,333
It means old-fashioned guys
aren't suited for this job.

236
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,000
Adapt, or the changing
current pulls down.

237
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,125
Isn't calling them
old-fashioned kinda harsh?

238
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,958
I mean you could at
least call them romantics.

239
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,000
You really think that
would give them comfort?

240
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,291
Would anything?

241
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,833
Your attention, please.

242
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,916
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

243
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,708
part of the
Public Safety Bureau.

244
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,958
For your protection,

245
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,166
access to this block is
currently restricted.

246
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,708
Excuse me. Are you
Inspector Tsunemori?

247
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,500
I am.

248
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,166
You've got some awful luck

249
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,458
to get this assignment
your first night.

250
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,041
Inspector Mika Shomotsuki
reporting for duty.

251
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,125
Pleased to meet you sir.
I have just been assigned.

252
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,916
Yeah I'm sorry, but the CID's
short on man power tonight.

253
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,708
I don't have time to give
you the rookie treatment.

254
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,583
Yes, I understand, sir.

255
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,458
I'm looking forward to the work.

256
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,041
Good answer.

257
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,375
A paddy wagon?

258
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,791
The people you're about to
meet are humans, just like us.

259
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,500
But they'll handle crimes

260
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,833
with judgment criteria
different from yours.

261
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,000
Trust them,
but at the same time,

262
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,458
be careful, and
remember who they are.

263
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,208
Underestimate them and
you're bound to get hurt.

264
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,375
Those people are what
we call "Enforcers."

265
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,250
And they're all
subordinate to you.

266
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,958
Activating Dominator Portable

267
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,750
Psychological Diagnosis
and Suppression System.
