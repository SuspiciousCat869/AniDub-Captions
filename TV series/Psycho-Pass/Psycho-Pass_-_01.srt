1
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,333
Shit!

2
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,250
You fought rather well
considering your wounds.

3
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,666
They must've
realized it the moment

4
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,250
they first laid
eyes on one another.

5
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,791
Realized that long
before they had ever met.

6
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,583
Destiny had planned
this encounter.

7
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,666
They were not two ships
passing in the night.

8
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,875
They understood each other

9
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,541
better than they
understood themselves.

10
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,750
Their focus was solely
reserved for the other.

11
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,333
You are... Shinya Kogami.

12
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:28,583
And you are Shogo Makishima.

13
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,250
Your attention, please.

14
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,916
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,208
of the Public Safety Bureau.

16
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,416
For your protection,

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,625
access to this block
is currently restricted.

18
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,916
Neighborhood
residents are required

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
to immediately
evacuate this area.

20
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,166
This message will now repeat.

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,458
Your attention, please.

22
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,750
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

23
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,375
of the Public Safety Bureau.

24
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,583
For your protection,

25
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,583
access to this block
is currently restricted.

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,000
Excuse me, sorry.

27
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,458
Excuse me. Do you know where
I can find Inspector Ginoza?

28
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,166
Right here. Well,
you've got some awful luck

29
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,250
to get this assignment
your first night on the job.

30
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,500
Inspector Akane Tsunemori
reporting for duty, sir.

31
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,666
Pleased to meet you, sir.
This is my first day.

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,000
I know.

33
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,666
I'm sorry, but the CID's
short on manpower tonight.

34
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,875
I don't have time to give
you the rookie treatment.

35
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,291
Our target's name
is Nobuo Okura.

36
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,875
A street scanner flagged
him during a Hue Check.

37
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,500
He was ordered
by a Security Drone

38
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,875
to receive therapy
but he panicked and ran.

39
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,416
His recorded Psycho-Pass
was forest green.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,916
So we can expect his aggression
and compulsion to be high.

41
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,916
Why would somebody
choose to let their Hue

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,833
get so cloudy over
receiving treatment?

43
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,250
There's a strong chance he's
using incompatible narcotics.

44
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,166
Regardless, he's far enough gone

45
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
that we don't need to
wait for Sibyl's judgment.

46
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,833
Of course he had to pick an
abolition block to hide out in.

47
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,541
So that's the challenge.

48
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,750
The block's not wired
with a relay device

49
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,958
so we can't send
in any drones in.

50
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,166
On top of that.

51
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,291
We've got multiple
eyewitness accounts stating

52
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,958
that Okura took someone
captive while fleeing.

53
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
He's got a hostage?

54
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,166
According to the
witness reports,

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,333
it looked to be a woman
in her early twenties.

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,208
We still haven't
confirmed her identity yet.

57
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,500
The block's been
fully evacuated?

58
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,625
The city records
list it as uninhabited.

59
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,208
but it's become a
den for the homeless.

60
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,541
So be prepared.

61
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,625
A paddy wagon?

62
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,666
The guys you're about to meet,

63
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,083
don't think of them
as human beings.

64
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,750
Their Psycho-Pass
Crime Coefficients

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,666
are above regulation value.

66
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,375
They're all deeply disturbed.

67
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,625
They would normally
be completely isolated

68
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,208
as latent criminals.

69
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,791
But we allow them
into the outside world

70
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,291
for a single purpose.

71
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,666
To flush out and hunt down
criminals just like themselves.

72
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,458
They're nothing more
than hunting dogs.

73
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,708
The best way to track
a beast is with a beast.

74
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,916
We call them enforcers.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,958
Each one of them
is your subordinate.

76
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,708
You said we were
gettin' a rookie,

77
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,083
but you didn't say
she would be so cute!

78
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,708
This is Inspector
Akane Tsunemori.

79
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,083
From today on, you'll know
her as your second owner.

80
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,708
Uh. It's a pleasure to meet you!

81
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,625
I'm assuming you've
already been briefed

82
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,666
on the target's data, right?

83
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,166
He's backed
himself into a corner

84
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,791
and we're gonna
tighten the noose.

85
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,208
We'll split into
two groups and zero in.

86
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:42,291
Alright, Kunizuka and Kagari.
You two are with me.

87
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,208
The other two are with
Inspector Tsunemori.

88
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,750
Roger that, sir.

89
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,625
Why do they get the babe and
I get stuck with your ugly mug?

90
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,208
Man, that guy has
no sense of humor.

91
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,083
'Cuz he knows you
weren't joking.

92
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,625
Have fun out there.

93
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,791
So, uh. What should I do now?

94
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,875
You could order us
to take a coffee break

95
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,541
and sit on our asses.

96
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,500
I don't think we'd
argue with that.

97
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,291
Why don't you try
earning your paycheck.

98
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,666
How's that sound?

99
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,916
No reason for ya to look
so nervous, little lady.

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,208
You've used a Dominator
before, haven't you?

101
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,000
Well I've received
basic training,

102
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,666
Then you know that
it's a gun that reads

103
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
the Psycho-Pass of the
target you're aiming at.

104
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,708
The safety is only released

105
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,291
when it registers the
target as a latent criminal.

106
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,958
All you've gotta do is follow
the Dominator's commands.

107
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,041
If it says shoot, then shoot.

108
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,458
That simple, huh?

109
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,041
The basic mode
is set to paralyzer.

110
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,750
As the name implies, it'll only
temporarily paralyze the target

111
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,833
so we can take
them into custody.

112
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,875
Go on. It's nothin'
to be scared of.

113
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,666
Activating Dominator Portable
Psychological Diagnosis

114
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,375
and Suppression System.

115
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,583
Now online. User authentication.

116
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,166
Inspector Akane Tsunemori,
Public Safety Bureau,

117
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,291
Criminal Investigation
Department.

118
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,208
Dominator usage approved.
You are a valid user.

119
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,833
You'll get used to that.
It's a directional voice.

120
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,708
Only you can hear it
since you're holding it.

121
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,625
Before long it'll blend right
in with your own thoughts.

122
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,500
What about briefing?

123
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,708
Shouldn't we have a meeting,
come up with some kind

124
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,125
of plan on how we're
gonna catch this guy?

125
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,916
The two of us'll hunt the prey

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
and you'll observe
our every move.

127
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,125
That's all there is to it.

128
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
I was thinking something
a little more strategic.

129
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,625
All he's saying
is leave it to us.

130
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,916
We may not look it,

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,958
but I promise you,
we know what we're doing.

132
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,166
Our methods work just fine.

133
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,041
But since you're the inspector.
You're responsible for us.

134
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,625
You decide that you don't
like the way I'm doing things.

135
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,125
Shoot me with your Dominator.

136
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:07,958
What?

137
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,500
We're latent criminals too,

138
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,708
no different than the target
so paralyze us if you have to.

139
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,958
I guess it might help
to know our names.

140
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,208
That stubborn bastard
is Shinya Kogami.

141
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,041
And this old bastard
is Tomomi Masaoka.

142
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
I'm lookin' forward
to workin' with ya.

143
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,166
I'm sure you'll do fine.

144
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,291
Oh. Thank you.

145
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,416
Well then. Should we head out?

146
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,583
Until today.

147
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,750
I've lived a more earnest
and honest life than anyone.

148
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,083
I've spent my whole
life walking on eggshells.

149
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,958
The perfect upright
nobody they want us to be,

150
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,333
not bothering anyone
and keeping to myself.

151
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,625
Then one time.

152
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,666
One time a street
scanner red-flags me

153
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,250
and just like that, they start
treating me like a criminal.

154
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,541
It's over for me.

155
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,208
There's no coming
back from this.

156
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,875
Basic employment, marriage,
it's all impossible now.

157
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,583
Well fine then.

158
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,458
I've restrained myself all this
time, but what's the point?

159
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,791
I might as well be
what they say I am.

160
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,541
I might as well just
kill anyone I feel like!

161
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,291
Pl-Please don't.

162
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,250
I'll let you in on one thing
I've always wanted to do.

163
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,125
I've always wanted to have sex
with a beautiful woman like you.

164
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,750
And not just a virtual one.

165
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,125
But a flesh and blood woman
I can feel screaming.

166
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,291
What about Kogami?

167
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,500
I didn't see which way he-

168
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,833
Crime Coefficient: under sixty.

169
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,458
Enforcement action not required.

170
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,416
The trigger is now locked.

171
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,833
Crime Coefficient:
over one hundred twenty.

172
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,916
Target is a registered Enforcer
status: Enforce at Will.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,291
Trigger safety now released.

174
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,500
He doesn't act like one, but
he really is a latent criminal.

175
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,041
He seems just
like a normal person.

176
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,833
I've heard some rumors
floating around about you.

177
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,208
Is it true you were top of
the class in your training?

178
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,625
Yeah, I guess so.

179
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,166
Here's a piece
of friendly advice.

180
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,416
Wipe each and every
thing you learned there out

181
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,958
of your head as
quickly as you can.

182
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,375
None of that crap's gonna
help you on a real case.

183
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,833
Ya probably think that
sounds unreasonable, huh?

184
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,875
Well lemme tell ya.

185
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,208
All the time
I've spent on this job,

186
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,333
I have yet to encounter
a single reasonable thing.

187
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,000
Everything a person
thinks and wishes for,

188
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,583
we live in a time when a
man's own mind is wide open

189
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,125
to anyone with
the right machine.

190
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,541
Despite this universally
known fact, there's still plenty

191
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,583
of people wanting to
deceive or hurt other humans.

192
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,041
Now does that sound
reasonable to you?

193
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,291
All of the theories and
logic they filled your head

194
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,291
with don't mean squat
out here in the field.

195
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,625
I doubt it'll take you too long

196
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,375
to realize just how
pointless your training was.

197
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,083
So be prepared to be unprepared.

198
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,666
Do you think...

199
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,500
Come in, this is Hound 4.

200
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,625
I've found the target on the
fourth floor of the KT building,

201
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,333
what are your orders?

202
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,083
Okay. Hold your position
and keep an eye on him.

203
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,666
Hound 2 and I will box him in.

204
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,125
Sure. Although.

205
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,375
Considering how
worked up he is right now.

206
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,791
I don't know if the hostage
is gonna make it that long.

207
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,750
You sure you don't want me
to go ahead and capture him?

208
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,291
Fine. Don't mess it up.

209
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,916
Of course not.

210
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,416
Crime Coefficient:
over one hundred ninety.

211
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,375
Enforcement action required.
Trigger safety now released.

212
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,041
Well, now, you are a degenerate.

213
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,000
Kagari, what the
hell are you doing?

214
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,416
The Paralyzer didn't work!

215
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,916
He's gotta be hopped up
on stimulants or something!

216
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,666
The target's Threat Judgment
has been reappraised.

217
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,208
Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

218
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,625
Shit!

219
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,666
Ah, great.

220
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,166
Is... Is this...

221
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,166
It's an Oracle
from the Sibyl System.

222
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,958
New judgment on Okura.

223
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,000
Seems he's overextended
his welcome in this world.

224
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,500
Elimination?

225
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,125
Just because he got flagged
by a routine street scan?

226
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,041
He probably drove himself into
a corner and it just got worse.

227
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,583
Nothing'll work on him anymore.

228
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,875
Not even therapy.

229
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,916
The judgment states
he's way outside

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,791
the realm of rehabilitation.

231
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,708
It's a damned shame
your first case

232
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,083
has turned out to
be such a nasty one.

233
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,583
Damn look at my Psycho-Pass.

234
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,000
I didn't even know it
could get this cloudy.

235
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,583
It looks like somebody
covered it in mud.

236
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,500
Hey. Take a gander
at your Psycho-Pass.

237
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,958
It almost looks
exactly like mine.

238
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,708
I guess you and
I are just alike now.

239
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,125
It'll be just as bad
for you if they catch us.

240
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,416
They'll lock you up
as a latent criminal

241
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,875
and torture you for
the rest of your life!

242
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,625
We better wrap this thing up

243
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,416
before the hostage passes
the point of no return.

244
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,541
You don't mean
Psycho-Hazard, do you?

245
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
I do.

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,833
It's a sad fact Crime
Coefficients can be contagious.

247
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,166
Young people these days are
rarely exposed to severe stress

248
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,416
so they're likely to break down

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,416
when confronted
with violent actions.

250
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,250
Yeah, I actually wrote a
thesis paper on the subject.

251
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,250
Well let me be the
first to tell you.

252
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,291
It could happen
to any one of us.

253
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,208
Enforcers for example.

254
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:23,000
You wanna know the reason we
became Enforcers in the fi-

255
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,041
Freeze!

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,416
Stay back!

257
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,750
Drop your guns or she dies!

258
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,083
Step back!

259
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,250
Die!

260
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
Why?

261
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,166
You have my deepest sympathies.

262
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,500
This is Hound 3.
Enforcement complete.

263
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,875
Using an old man and
a rookie as a decoy.

264
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,791
You've got a pair of cold,

265
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,041
stainless steel balls,
don't you, Ko?

266
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,500
Whatever it takes to
earn the paycheck, pops.

267
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,291
It's okay, we're with
the Public Safety Bureau.

268
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
I promise, you're safe now.

269
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,791
Just calm down.

270
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,375
Ma'am we're here to
rescue you, that's all!

271
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,583
No. You can't do this to me.

272
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,791
Please don't.

273
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,250
Mr. Masaoka?

274
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,125
Listen to me now.

275
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,958
You need to check
her stats on your gun.

276
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,041
Crime Coefficient:
over one sixty.

277
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,500
Enforcement action required.

278
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,291
Well. Nothin' we
can do about it.

279
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,166
Leave her alone!

280
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,833
What're you doing?

281
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,583
We're supposed to
be protecting her!

282
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,958
What the hell do you
think the Paralyzer is for?

283
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,333
We'll knock her out and
take her in to get help!

284
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,750
She's just frightened
and confused,

285
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,708
you don't have to use
the Dominator on her!

286
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,625
You know the Dominators are
connected straight to Sibyl.

287
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,250
The city's system
itself has determined

288
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,583
this woman is a
threat to society!

289
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291
Think about what that means!

290
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,500
And you're just perfectly fine

291
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,083
with shooting an innocent woman?

292
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,750
I refuse to accept that's right!

293
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,916
Stay back. Leave me alone.

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,666
Don't come any closer.

295
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,291
Get away from me!

296
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,583
Kogami, wait!

297
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,916
Please, you can't do this.

298
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,833
Please stop.

299
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,250
She's the victim here
and we can't.

300
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,375
The target's Threat Judgment
has been reappraised.

301
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,416
Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

302
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,541
Trigger safety released.

303
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,708
Aim carefully and
eliminate the target.

304
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,291
Please stop.

305
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,458
I said stoooooppppp!

306
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,500
That's enough now.

307
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,166
You've gotta put
the lighter down.

308
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,833
Cause if you don't.

309
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,458
Then I can't stop this
gun from killing you.

310
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,333
Please, I only wanna help you.

311
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Throw the lighter down
and everything will be fine.

312
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,833
The target's Threat Judgment
has been reappraised.

313
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,291
Enforcement mode:

314
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,291
Non-lethal Paralyzer.

315
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,958
Trigger safety released. Aim
calmly and subdue the target.

316
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,166
Inspector Tsunemori.

317
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,333
I want a thorough
explanation of your actions.

318
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,833
I expect a detailed report
