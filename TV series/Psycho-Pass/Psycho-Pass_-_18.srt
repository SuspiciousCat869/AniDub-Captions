1
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,375
There it is.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,375
Step aside!

3
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,875
Inspector Ginoza
of CID Division One.

4
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,750
You are not eligible for
access to this information.

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,416
You're forbidden to enter.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
What?

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,625
Inspector allow me to explain.

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,875
Chief Kasei.

9
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,375
Shogo Makishima.

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,208
How did he escape from
a prisoner transport plane?

11
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,875
Our theory is Makishima
received assistance

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,208
from a turncoat working
inside the Ministry of Welfare.

13
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,083
Otherwise, it would
have been impossible

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,416
to escape like he did.

15
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,833
After hearing how little
we've recovered from the crash,

16
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,291
I'm now certain the only
way we'll know what happened

17
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,583
is to hear it
from his own mouth.

18
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,958
This is why when you
re-capture Makishima,

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,916
your number one priority
is bringing him in alive.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,875
I'm putting Division One
back on this case.

21
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,250
Just what on earth
is going on here?

22
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,250
I deserve an answer
that makes sense.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,166
Ginoza.

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,541
Yes?

25
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,083
Not only did Enforcer Kagari
vanish on your watch,

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,791
your investigation into his
disappearance has hit a wall.

27
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,500
I figure if I make it
Division One's priority

28
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,250
to re-capture Makishima alive

29
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,291
you can sweep your Kagari
blunder under the rug.

30
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,291
You should be thanking me.

31
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
This is my way of showing

32
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,791
some confidence
in Division One again.

33
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,666
I hope you can
actually appreciate

34
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,208
that I'm sticking out
my neck for you on this.

35
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,083
But Chief...

36
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,708
One more thing. Enforcer Kogami.

37
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,333
I'm ordering you to
take him off the case

38
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,500
and place him under
strict supervision

39
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,083
For what reason?

40
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,208
I already answered that.

41
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,541
Your top priority is
recapturing Shogo Makishima

42
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,958
and bringing him to me alive.

43
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,458
Starting now,
Division Two will spearhead

44
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,125
the investigation looking
into Kagari's disappearance.

45
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,583
As for us at Division One

46
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,750
we're in charge of
locating Shogo Makishima.

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125
Oh, and Enforcer Kogami.

48
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,666
I want you to stay here.

49
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,958
You can help Shion
with the lab analysis.

50
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,125
Search the data
for any new leads.

51
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,083
These orders come from the top.

52
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,625
Well...

53
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,333
I can't be the only one
who thinks it's strange

54
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,250
the Chief just took
me off the case, right?

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:35,250
I mean we're already short on
manpower so it can't be that.

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,500
None of it makes
any sense to me.

57
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,041
This means the only
thing that matters

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,583
to the Chief now is
Makishima's safety.

59
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,333
Whether he goes on
another killing spree

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,291
is a secondary concern.

61
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
We're not hunting.

62
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,291
It's more like she's put
us on "protective duty."

63
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,791
The top brass has no intention

64
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,000
of putting Makishima on trial.

65
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,083
Sure, they want us
to re-capture him,

66
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,791
but I think it's only so
the they can use him for some

67
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,875
other purpose that we don't
know anything about yet.

68
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,625
Am I wrong?

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,041
What do you base this on?

70
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,541
I told you what Makishima
claimed when he called me.

71
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,666
He said he had
learned the true nature

72
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,500
of what the
Sibyl System actually is.

73
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,541
He discovered something
about its inner workings

74
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,708
that none of us are
supposed to know about.

75
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,208
Please. He's bluffing you!

76
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,208
And since when have we taken
psycopaths at their word?

77
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,916
It adds up.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,541
If someone in charge
of the Sibyl System

79
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,416
was feeding him information.

80
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,125
He could've used it to escape.

81
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,416
Only instead of getting angry
with Makishima's betrayal

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,625
this person has simply
become obsessed with him

83
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,416
and the idea of using
his skills to his own ends.

84
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,958
But the Sibyl
System's guaranteed

85
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,666
to be free of corruption from
any person or organization.

86
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,875
No one has that kind
of control over it.

87
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,666
I think right now, Makishima's
the only one of us

88
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,250
who knows if that's
how Sibyl really works.

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Let's look at the facts.

90
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,000
He was transported by air,

91
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,666
with only drone guards,
instead of in a paddy wagon.

92
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,291
That isn't normal.

93
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,541
They say he was alone,

94
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,666
but what was the body
removed from the crash?

95
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,125
They've already
wiped all mention of it

96
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,375
in the official record but
we all saw them moving it.

97
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,750
I don't think any
of us are buying

98
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,166
what they're trying to sell
us about that crash, Ko.

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,416
But if there's a conspiracy
like you think there is,

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,708
our Inspectors ain't gonna
know any more than you.

101
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,250
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

102
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,000
You gotta good point there.

103
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,625
I'm taking my lunch.

104
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,250
Hey!

105
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,208
Kogami, wait up!

106
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,500
Everything that's
happened lately.

107
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916
It's all a farce.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,458
The Senguji case, for example.

109
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,291
I snuck a look at the final
report Gino sent upstairs.

110
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,791
Don't tell.

111
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,416
You can't keep doing that.

112
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,166
The way your Dominator
wouldn't judge Makishima.

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,083
There was no record
of that anywhere.

114
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,750
The way it was
written it's like Gino

115
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,666
was forced to delete
that part after the fact.

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,958
But why?

117
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,333
The top brass at the
MWPSB's trying to destroy

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,583
any evidence that there are
people who Sibyl can't judge.

119
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,458
I don't think they
know what to do.

120
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,916
You don't seem angry.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,375
Of course I am. It's just.

122
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,541
The other day,
when it looked like

123
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,041
the riots would take
over the whole city.

124
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,750
I guess I suddenly had
an epiphany about society.

125
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,250
I've always known enforcing
justice is important.

126
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
But so's maintaining order.

127
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,291
So...?

128
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,625
What do we do with
those outside the law?

129
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,083
The criminals that
the Dominator can't read?

130
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,666
In the case of Makishima
we have no choice.

131
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,208
We'll have to revert back
to the pre-Sibyl legal system.

132
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,375
He can be prosecuted in a court.

133
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,333
He'll defend himself and
hopefully a jury sentences him.

134
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,666
That's all we can do.

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,166
"All we can do"?

136
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,833
That's a pretty
daunting process.

137
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,458
I wonder how long it would
take to set up and see through.

138
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,083
Well, I can't think
of a better way.

139
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,541
But there was one. Remember?

140
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,708
A method that wouldn't
have caused any trouble.

141
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,916
When he was on the floor.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,666
You should have bashed
his skull in with that helmet.

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,791
And if I can get that
close to him again.

144
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,958
I swear you won't
have to do a thing.

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,250
An Inspector
can't play vigilante.

146
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,666
But I can.

147
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,916
I'm just an Enforcer

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,125
who's got nothing left
in this world to lose.

149
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,583
That's how our
partnership ought to work.

150
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,541
Let me be the hunting
dog they always say I am.

151
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,958
Killing Makishima
doesn't enforce the law.

152
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,875
It only brings another
murderer into the world.

153
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,166
Kogami.

154
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,333
You once told me you
wanted to be a detective.

155
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,750
Not just some
violent hunting dog.

156
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,041
You sure do remember
a lot of silly things.

157
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,666
That talk wasn't silly,
it was really important.

158
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,583
It's because of what you told me

159
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:47,000
that I didn't quit this
job when I was feeling lost.

160
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,958
Mister Kogami.

161
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,083
I need to know you'll
be a detective, not a dog.

162
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,875
Can you please make that
promise to me, right now?

163
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Yeah.

164
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
I can't be the
only one who thinks

165
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,583
the Chief's treating us like
dogs and this mission is her way

166
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,916
of throwing us a
ball to play with.

167
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,958
So. What am
I supposed to do then?

168
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,791
What's the right response for
an Inspector in my situation?

169
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,833
There is no right answer.

170
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,125
All you can do
now is compromise.

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,083
Hey uh...

172
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,708
Listen to me Nobuchika.

173
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,583
What is it now?

174
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,416
Watch your back, son.

175
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,250
Like I was trying to say.

176
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,750
This whole thing's
just a game of fetch

177
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,000
between a
master and her dogs.

178
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,750
And if you don't do what she
wants, you'll get punished.

179
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,333
If I were you I'd step outside

180
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,583
the pecking order try to
take on a more neutral role.

181
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,500
Don't be dog or master.

182
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,708
And be what, then?

183
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,500
Become like the ball.

184
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,541
Forever rolling,
bouncing back and forth

185
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,708
between the two opposing sides.

186
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,333
I know it sounds
a bit humiliating,

187
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,541
but that's the best way

188
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,791
to keep the politics
from wearing you down.

189
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,916
That's the wisest path to walk.

190
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,791
Hate to be blunt,
but I think this

191
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,583
case is getting to
be too much for you.

192
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,708
So instead of taking on
more than you can handle.

193
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,708
Roll around without
drawing anyone's attention.

194
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,166
Make yourself
useless to the PSB.

195
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,875
You know, that's the
worst career advice

196
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
I've ever been given.

197
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,458
Hell.

198
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,791
That's office politics.

199
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,833
I was hoping you'd
figure it out yourself,

200
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,541
you're good at that stuff.

201
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,791
So much for wisdom.

202
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,541
We can't afford to
have Kogami on desk duty

203
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,166
while we run around the
city chasing Makishima.

204
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,125
Even if Kogami's a
dog that bites his master?

205
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,416
When it comes to sniffing
out Makishima's trail

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,625
there's no other
hunting dog at the PSB

207
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,833
with a nose as good as Kogami's.

208
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,833
That detective
instinct you talk about.

209
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,541
I don't think it
got passed on to me.

210
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,166
If it did, it would have
shown itself by now.

211
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,708
But the Chief tied your hands.

212
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,000
She's the one who ordered
him off the case, right?

213
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,125
If we can set Kogami loose,
we'll get Makishima.

214
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,708
But how?

215
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,041
That's the million
dollar question I need

216
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,333
to find an answer for, fast.

217
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,250
Inspector Ginoza,
I didn't figure you

218
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,875
for someone to come up
with such a radical idea.

219
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,625
Desperate times.

220
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,583
I wanted to say thank you.

221
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,625
I know this is a
risk for Division Two.

222
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
No worries.

223
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,208
Between Kagari's disappearance
and Makishima's escape,

224
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,958
something fishy is going on.

225
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,541
I don't have a problem
shaking things up

226
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,416
if it helps us solve both cases.

227
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,333
Alright listen everyone.

228
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,625
After the attack, the whole
Criminal Investigation Division

229
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,416
is down two Enforcers.

230
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,458
At a time like
this we can't have you

231
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,791
sitting around, doing
busy work in the lab.

232
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,458
So I had a thought.

233
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,583
And Inspector Aoyanagi
agreed with me.

234
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,916
She's gonna let
you switch places

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,750
with one of her
team's Enforcers.

236
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,041
So, you'll go with them

237
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,500
and get to the bottom of
Kagari's disappearance.

238
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,291
A Division Two Enforcer
will come help us

239
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,166
with the Makishima case.

240
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,625
We have so few clues on Kagari.

241
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,958
We need a new
approach and getting help

242
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,416
from an Enforcer
who knew the guy

243
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,541
is the best idea I've heard yet.

244
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,000
Kogami, I hear you're good,

245
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,750
but I don't want
any stupid stunts.

246
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,875
At least while
my eyes are on you.

247
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,500
I hear ya, ma'am.

248
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,750
This is a special circumstance,
under Code K-32.

249
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,208
We will take
Shinya Kogami into custody.

250
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,958
What?

251
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,708
Did you really think
you could outwit me

252
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,625
with such a simple trick?

253
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,208
You must take your
Chief for quite the fool.

254
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,583
I must say, I'm rather flattered

255
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,166
by all the attention you've
been showing me, Chief

256
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,083
I didn't know you
were such a fan.

257
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,458
Why a person in your
situation would still think

258
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:36,500
it wise to talk back to a
superior is hard to fathom.

259
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,833
Chief, wait!

260
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,125
Please, you have
to let me explain.

261
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,041
I don't think you realize.

262
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,125
Oh, no explanation is necessary.

263
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,250
Poor Ginoza.

264
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,666
Can't you see this is a moment

265
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,958
where the more you talk
the more trouble you'll get in?

266
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,208
In my experience,
I find it's not always true

267
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,041
that a subordinate's
initial mistake

268
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,958
should be harshly judged.

269
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,416
All that truly matters
is the ultimate result.

270
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,125
That is the only
basis for evaluation.

271
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,416
In our line of
work we have to make

272
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,375
risky moves to
achieve our goals.

273
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,250
What's important is
knowing when to step away.

274
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,708
How quickly and firmly you can
close the book on your failures.

275
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,875
That is the way I judge
the true merits of an officer.

276
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,916
So then. My inspector.

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,250
An Enforcer under your
direct supervision is about

278
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,583
to commit a serious dereliction
of duty and a breach of trust.

279
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,083
How will you deal with this man?

280
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,375
Instead of going on

281
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,833
with your pitiful
half-measures and excuses.

282
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,750
Will you at last be able
to demonstrate to me

283
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,916
that you are a man capable of
clear and bold decisiveness?

284
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,500
Crime Coefficient:
two hundred sixty-five.

285
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,625
Target is a registered Enforcer.

286
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,625
Status, Enforce at Will.

287
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,583
Trigger safety now released.

288
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,250
Yes, this is good, Ginoza.

289
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,875
You're finally proving
your usefulness.

290
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,291
But, I'd like to see you be more
thorough with the Dominator.

291
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,958
Enforcement Mode:
Non-Lethal Paraly- izzzeee.

292
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,916
Enforcement Mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

293
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,000
That's better.

294
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,333
It's time then, Ginoza.

295
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,208
Show me an Inspector who
can discipline his people.

296
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,458
Show me your
ruthless decisiveness.

297
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,583
Your actions
unhindered by emotion.

298
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,166
A target whose
Crime Coeffecient's

299
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,416
under three hundred.

300
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,208
Must be incapacitated
using Paralyzer Mode.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,083
Ginoza.

302
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,291
It appears that your
Dominator is broken.

303
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,083
You should send it in
for repairs right away.

304
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,541
Uh, yeah.

305
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,791
Akane.

306
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,541
You'll have to thank
her when she wakes.

307
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,791
Instead of hitting
your central nerve,

308
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,041
she got you in the
fatty part of your thigh.

309
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,416
Guess she's gotten pretty
comfortable with her Dominator.

310
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,916
You know something?

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,875
Every time a rookie starts
becoming a hardened detective,

312
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,375
it makes me feel proud

313
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,708
but it also makes me
feel a little bit sad too.

314
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,125
It's bittersweet I suppose.

315
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,750
She'll keep on getting
tougher case by case.

316
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,541
I've been wondering.

317
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,416
Oh, yeah, about what?

318
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,791
Is that cymatic scan blocking
helmet still functional?

319
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,958
For now.

320
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,333
But once the
Sibyl System's back online,

321
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,208
they'll install network
counter-measures

322
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,666
that will brick it like
an old game console.

323
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,208
Once that's done, it'll be
a regular old helmet again.

324
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,750
And when will that be?

325
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,375
Another six days.

326
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,750
You're not gonna
steal evidence, are you?

327
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,166
Actually I need it
for the investigation.

328
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,750
This from the guy who
almost got executed?

329
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,333
I guess they told you
guys about that, too, huh?

330
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,666
Hm. Maybe they didn't say.

331
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,916
I think I might have misheard
some office gossip.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,083
Promise me you won't take
it outside the building.

333
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,791
Don't worry, I won't.

334
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:43,958
Hey, Shinya.

335
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,250
Hm?

336
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,791
I've been kicking myself.

337
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,208
After all this time,

338
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,416
I should have hooked up
with you at least once, right?

339
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I don't know, Shion.

340
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,750
Never seemed like we
were each other's type.

341
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,625
I guess you're right.

342
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,250
Ah, that god damn helmet.

343
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,291
I forgot we still had one.

344
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm celebrating
your good health,

345
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,125
here, drink's on me, kid.

346
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,583
I've been looking at
your dossier on Makishima.

347
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,250
You collected good info.

348
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,541
And it's well-organized, too.

349
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,875
No offense,

350
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,458
but I certainly wasn't
expecting that out of you.

351
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,666
You laid it out in a way
so you don't have to

352
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,250
wade through a buncha fluff
to get to the important stuff.

353
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,375
Why are you so
obsessed with Makishima?

354
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,208
Is it the evil
crimes he commits,

355
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,291
or is it something else,
in the man himself?

356
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,208
Neither of those,
Pops. It's fear.

357
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,958
Fear that if I give up the hunt.

358
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,208
I won't be able to live

359
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,000
with myself for letting
that madman get away.

360
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,708
I can't allow that to happen.

361
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,708
Now why am I not
surprised by that, Ko.

362
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,750
These are from when
I worked for the Metro PD.

363
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,416
They're to a safe house I set-up

364
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,458
for myself in case
I ever got in hot water.

365
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,041
But now you might
need it more than me

366
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,875
Thanks, Pops.

367
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,166
Just don't leave before you
say goodbye to the little missy.

368
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,458
I can't face her right now.

369
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,458
Well then at least find some way

370
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,208
to help her come
to terms with it.

371
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,041
Alright.

372
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,833
Akane, I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my promise to you.

373
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,125
Ever since I was young,

374
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,083
I wanted a job where
I could protect people.

375
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,000
So I became a detective.

376
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,708
But with his crimes,
Makishima changed everything.

377
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,375
As long as he's out there,
he's going to keep killing.

378
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,708
But the law can't--
or won't--judge him.

379
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,458
And as long as I'm a detective,
I can't stop him either.

380
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,166
This case made me
see things differently.

381
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,333
That the law can't
always protect people.

382
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,916
So to do that,
I'll need to step outside it.

383
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
Akane Tsunemori.

384
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,750
I've no doubt that your way
of living is the right way.

385
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,458
Don't lose sight of that
just because I'm betraying you.

386
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm selfishly choosing
to walk this path

387
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,375
because it's the only
way I can live with myself.

388
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,916
The only way
I can sleep at night.

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,666
In a lot of ways,
I know this is a mistake.

390
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,750
But I also know
I can only come to terms

391
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,708
with my old self by
walking the wrong path

392
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,000
and overcoming the
monsters that haunt me.

393
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,791
I won't say.
"Please, forgive me."

394
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,583
Because I know
the next time we meet.

395
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,333
You'll be called
upon to judge me.

396
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:11,875
I expect you to fulfill
your duty, without mercy.

397
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,750
Don't turn your
back on your beliefs.

398
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Though we haven't
known each other long,

399
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,958
I'll always be grateful
I got to work under you.

400
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,541
So thank you.

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,250
You fool.
