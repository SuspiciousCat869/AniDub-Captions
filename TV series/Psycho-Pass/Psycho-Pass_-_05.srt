1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,291
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,458
You seem to think those words
actually mean something,

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,833
so I'll explain
it to you like this.

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,833
If sorry was enough, we wouldn't
even need the police, would we?

5
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,583
After the complete outrage
your people managed to cause.

6
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,666
You still let Talisman get away.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,500
Seriously. I don't
know what the hell

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,541
I was thinking cooperating
with the police.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,541
But still.
There's not a single doubt

10
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,375
that Talisman is guilty
of a really serious crime.

11
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,166
Didn't you offer to help
us because you felt like

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,875
you couldn't just turn
a blind eye to that fact?

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,291
Who do you think I am?

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,166
I'm Spooky Boogie,
the notorious anarchist.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,333
I slipped up once,
but under no circumstances

16
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,875
will I ever act as
your agent again.

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,541
But I...

18
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,333
Sounds like it might've put
a dent in your friendship.

19
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:07,125
Well. We were just in the same
graduating class together.

20
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,375
I actually don't
even know who she is.

21
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,583
You recorded that whole
conversation, right?

22
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,333
What? Yeah, of course.

23
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,291
Talisman Saloon's packed wall

24
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,708
to virtual wall
with guests as usual.

25
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,791
Yet another busy day for
the ghost of Kimihiko Hayama,

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,041
doling out advice
without a care in the world.

27
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,916
The guy knows the
CID is on to him.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,333
And he's not bothering to hide.

29
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,375
He's even making
speeches about the raid.

30
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,666
It's time we figure out
just what his game is.

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,791
Is he trying to
convince the world

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,250
that Kimihiko
Hayama's still alive?

33
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,458
Seems like he'd at least
make a withdrawal or two

34
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,250
from Hayama's bank account if
he was trying to cover it up.

35
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,416
Do you think his only goal here

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,750
could be hijacking
Hayama's avatar?

37
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,958
There's gotta be easier
ways of going about that.

38
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,416
Unless he murdered him
just for the fun of it.

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,291
Hey. Don't try so hard

40
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,083
to understand the
criminal mind, Gino.

41
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,708
You'll wind up with us.

42
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,708
It's just too bad
you never bothered

43
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,916
to take your own advice, Kogami.

44
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,791
Hey, now.

45
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,000
Even if he's doing this
just for kicks, he's no fool.

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,000
He knew he was bound to
arouse suspicion eventually.

47
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,875
There's no way he could've
hacked the Holo-Cosplay

48
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,416
on the spur of the moment.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,125
He was prepared for the chance
he was walking into a trap.

50
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,083
We've got no choice
but to teach him a lesson

51
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,625
if he thinks he can
outsmart us. Alright, Shion.

52
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,666
I want you to trace all of
Talisman's access routes.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,083
He's bound to slip up
and lead us right to him.

54
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,541
You think it'll be that easy?

55
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,875
I mean the guy's obviously
pretty sure of his ability

56
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,125
to hide his tracks.

57
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,458
He wouldn't be popping
in and out of forums

58
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,750
if he wasn't confident
that he won't get caught.

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,916
So we should just sit
around and do nothing?

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,916
No, but I think that we
might have a better option

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,541
for getting a lead on him.

62
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,541
Not only that, I wanna
look into something else.

63
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,250
Well that's fine then.
Suit yourself.

64
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,333
But we're still putting a
trace on his access routes.

65
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,041
I just can't understand
this avatar stuff.

66
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,375
What's the point
of a virtual world?

67
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,541
I mean, what's wrong
with the real world?

68
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,416
Why can't these people just
go out and talk in person?

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Spoken like a true technophobe.

70
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,541
You're part of an endangered
species, Mr. Masaoka.

71
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,875
Look at it this way.

72
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,708
Using the net is no
different than using a knife

73
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,833
for cooking or a
pen for writing.

74
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,458
It's just another helpful
tool for our lives.

75
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not good or bad.

76
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,375
Simply enough, it's just there,
so we accept it and use it.

77
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,125
Well put. I like how
you explain things.

78
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,666
You'd make a good teacher.

79
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,208
You really think so?

80
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,375
Are you familiar with Rousseau?

81
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,333
Um. The philosopher?

82
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,583
That's right.

83
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,291
Specifically his work A
Discourse on Inequality.

84
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,083
Oh, hold on a sec.
I'll just look it up real fast.

85
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,708
There's no need for that.

86
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,708
I've got the whole thing
stored right up here.

87
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,208
For instance.

88
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,625
Suppose there are two
hunters in the woods.

89
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,458
Now they both
want the same thing,

90
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,666
so should they hunt
separately for rabbits.

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,750
Or should they work together
and go after bigger prey?

92
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,500
Which decision strikes
you as the better option.

93
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,000
Well the latter, of course.

94
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,583
That's basic game theory.

95
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,083
It's always best
to work together.

96
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,833
Precisely. Humans are
social creatures by nature.

97
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,791
Language, artwork,
currency, telephones.

98
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,750
Almost everything you can
think of is a communication tool

99
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,583
meant to strengthen
that social nature,

100
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,583
to help bring us together.

101
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,375
Now do you believe the
net fulfills that purpose?

102
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,666
That's the question.

103
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,333
Well I... Yeah, I think it does.

104
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,708
That's kind of intriguing.

105
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,083
I'd be happy to offer
you some assistance.

106
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:02,166
A PSB bureaucrat in
debt to little old me?

107
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,333
Could come in handy.

108
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,041
That's kind of intriguing.

109
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,625
I'd be happy to offer
you some assistance.

110
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,583
If sorry was enough, we wouldn't
even need the police, would we?

111
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,208
Seriously, I don't
know what the hell

112
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,916
I was thinking
cooperating with the police.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,791
There it is.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,458
You have something?

115
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,833
I don't know what the
hell I was thinking,

116
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,333
cooperating with the police.

117
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,958
Her choice of
words is different.

118
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,916
She says PSB at first,
but then she says the police.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,708
Couldn't that be a coincidence?

120
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,166
Maybe, but let's run
a search through

121
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,625
as many of her
past logs as we can.

122
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,541
That's what I thought.

123
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,833
Going by this, you could count
all of the times Spooky Boogie

124
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,125
used the word
"police" on one finger.

125
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,291
You were speaking with a
different person this morning.

126
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,875
You were speaking
with the murderer.

127
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,291
That means he's now controlling
two avatars that we know of.

128
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,000
According to the tracking,

129
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
the Talisman avatar is
being operated from here.

130
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,875
This apartment.

131
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,500
Door breach.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,625
Oh, shit!

133
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
It's always bound
to be terrible news

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,875
whenever I get a call from you.

135
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,250
Well, you might like this.

136
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,000
Looks like some hunting
dogs got caught in the trap.

137
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,125
That is good news.

138
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,125
I can get you as many
replacement proxy servers

139
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,958
as you need me to. As long as
you still plan on continuing.

140
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,083
Of course I
do. It's my duty, after all.

141
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,000
Well. You are
Mr. Makishima's favorite,

142
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,333
but a word to the wise.

143
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,375
Whatever you do, just make
sure you don't screw up.

144
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,208
How the hell are
you two not injured?

145
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,500
Geez, we'll make
sure to die next time.

146
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,833
Maybe you should learn
to duck a little faster.

147
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,166
What is it?

148
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,541
We've discovered
a second victim.

149
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,125
The user behind Spooky Boogie.

150
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,791
We searched through Inspector
Tsunemori's class records

151
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,250
and narrowed it down to people
who earned affiliate income.

152
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,208
Shoko Sugawara,
twenty years old.

153
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,875
The murder took
place in her home

154
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,250
in the exact same
manner as Hayama's.

155
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,500
We've found some of
her remains in the sewer

156
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,041
and yet her avatar is just
as lively as it ever was.

157
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,291
The estimated time of
death is before dawn.

158
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,750
They must've killed her shortly
after the raid last night.

159
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's rendezvous at the office

160
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,000
and reassess our
plans with Shion.

161
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,250
If things keep up like this,

162
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,541
he'll have us right in
the palm of his hand.

163
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,916
Shit.

164
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,666
This is all my fault.

165
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,000
She got involved in
this because of me.

166
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,041
Don't talk like that.

167
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,916
But it's true, it's my fault.
She's dead because I...

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,916
Did you use Shoko as a decoy?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,125
Was that your purpose
in accepting her help?

170
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,041
No.

171
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,333
Did you coerce her to cooperate?

172
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,708
No.

173
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,333
Did you leak any of her
information to the suspect?

174
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,208
No.

175
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,625
Then what exactly is your fault?

176
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,791
Well yeah, but... she...
she got murdered.

177
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, and if we had managed to
catch the suspect last night,

178
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,750
then Shoko Sugawara
wouldn't have had to die.

179
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,666
So we're all
responsible for that.

180
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,833
Let's stay focused on not making
the same mistake a second time.

181
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,208
Let's catch this guy.

182
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,291
Simply put: It's the
only thing we can do

183
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,666
to help the victims
rest in peace.

184
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,791
Looks like I've stumbled
across another phantom forum.

185
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,041
Rainy Blue, hosted
by Melancholia.

186
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,500
It's registered to
an 82 year old man,

187
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,750
but only because his
grandson begged the codger

188
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,625
to let him use his personal
info to create it.

189
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,625
But, the grandson
got into an accident

190
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,583
a little over half a year ago.

191
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,000
Yuichi Tokitou, 14 years old.

192
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,458
But of course, his avatar's
still kickin' around

193
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,958
the net just like
the kid had never died.

194
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,708
The grandfather
doesn't even know

195
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,083
how to sign in to
the social networks.

196
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,083
On top of that, he just
assumed the affiliate income

197
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,500
he was receiving was
part of his pension.

198
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,125
Rainy Blue is big, too.

199
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,708
It's a popular community.

200
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,166
Man, is anyone alive
on the internet?

201
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,625
Is it even possible

202
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,500
to simultaneously operate
multiple avatars like that?

203
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,291
It's not too uncommon for an
experienced, heavy user, right?

204
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,916
The most remarkable
aspect of this

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,791
is the suspect's
performance.

206
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,291
Three stolen avatars.

207
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,375
Nobody suspects
anything strange at all.

208
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,083
In fact, he's made
them more popular

209
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,083
than they were
in the first place.

210
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,666
Tens of thousands of users

211
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,916
and not one of them has
noticed that he's a fake.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,625
It's 'cuz it doesn't
matter if he's fake or real.

213
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,916
These avatars are idols to them.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,125
They're icons.

215
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,458
Icons don't become
icons of their own will.

216
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,916
They're like projections.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,583
Neither Hayama nor
Sugawara established

218
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,833
their popular status
on their own.

219
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,291
Talisman and Spooky Boogie
are just as much a creation

220
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,625
of their fan's idolization, what
their fans wanted them to be.

221
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,291
The truth of the
person behind the icon

222
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,500
is rarely the same as the
truth of the icon itself.

223
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,625
It's not too surprising that
a fan could do a better job

224
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,291
than the actual user at
delivering what the fans expect.

225
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,333
They know what they want.

226
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,083
So you think this guy
was originally a fan?

227
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,166
Melancholia, Talisman,
and Spooky Boogie.

228
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,666
He knows each one of these
characters inside and out

229
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,041
and he can imitate
them perfectly.

230
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,041
This kind of behavior
is clearly driven

231
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,291
by the enthusiasm of a fan.

232
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,791
Great, how do we find him?

233
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,166
With all three of these avatars,

234
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,375
we've gotta be talking about
thousands upon thousands

235
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,291
of fans to sort through.

236
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,041
We can narrow things down.

237
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,375
We'll start with the
Talisman avatar first.

238
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,250
Bring up his top 100 fans.

239
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,166
All of his most
frequent visitors.

240
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,875
Draw up a graph of their
time spent there per day.

241
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,583
Isolate it to around the time
of Kimihiko Hayama's death.

242
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,625
Looks like it was more valleys
than peaks around that period.

243
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,416
The CommuField attendance
was pretty low then.

244
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,416
That's right around when
Talisman's reputation

245
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,125
was starting to sour.

246
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,583
But then, it makes an
almost full recovery

247
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,583
on this day two months ago.

248
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,750
And Hayama was
dead by that point.

249
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,958
Talisman had already
been hijacked.

250
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,875
But there were still
some regulars that stopped

251
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,375
coming to the
CommuField even though

252
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,958
his popularity was
back on the upswing.

253
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,625
It's these drop-off
rates that are the key.

254
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,291
Check the traffic stats

255
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,291
for Rainy Blue around
the time Tokito died.

256
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,291
the same with Spooky
Boogie's CommuField,

257
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,375
but check the day
before yesterday.

258
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,666
There should be one user
who shows the same pattern.

259
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,916
I see. We're pinpointing
the suspect's own avatar.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,708
Yeah, exactly.

261
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,500
Once the suspect managed
to hijack the victim's avatars,

262
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,750
he no longer had
any reason to visit

263
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,166
their CommuFields
with his own avatar.

264
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,708
How's it look?
Any matching activity?

265
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,833
There's only one person
with those stats.

266
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,375
Masatake Mido, 27 years old.

267
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,958
Works at a virtual
sports management company.

268
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,958
He hasn't had a
Psycho-Pass Hue Check

269
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,416
since a routine scan
four years ago.

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,583
We don't even have a record

271
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,000
of a single street
scanner picking him up.

272
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,750
He must've plotted
out his daily routine

273
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,625
around specific routes that
avoided street scanners.

274
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,125
A pretty good sign that he's
got something to hide, huh?

275
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,500
Put a trace on his
recent access records.

276
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,166
One step ahead of you.

277
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,083
His last access was
just a few minutes ago.

278
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,416
From a flea-bag budget
hotel in Roppongi.

279
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,625
The Minato Ward.

280
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,750
And his home address
is in the same ward.

281
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,125
Inspector Tsunemori.
You've got the hotel room.

282
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,125
Take Kogami and
Masaoka with you.

283
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,333
Yes, sir.

284
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,750
I'll head over and check
out his home address

285
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,500
with Kagari and Kunizuka.

286
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,083
Let me remind you how
dangerous this guy is.

287
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,708
Not only can he crack code, he
can handle explosives.

288
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,541
Don't let your guard down.

289
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,541
Drinking on the job?

290
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
Heavy-duty booze is
the most effective tool

291
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,583
there is for handling
illegal holograms.

292
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,458
Yep. You'll find it useful
once you turn twenty-one.

293
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,250
MWPSB! Masatake Mido.

294
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,625
We demand to see your
Psycho-Pass at once!

295
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,666
Come out with your hands up!

296
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,208
What's going on here?

297
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,458
He's apparently got a talent

298
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,166
for cracking Interior
Holography as well!

299
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,500
Ko!

300
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,083
What do we do?

301
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,708
Ko!

302
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
Crime Coefficient:
Three-Thirty-Five.

303
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,541
Enforcement mode:

304
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,125
Lethal Eliminator.

305
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,083
Must be on a
pain-inhibiting drug.

306
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,083
He's not gonna go
far with that wound.

307
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,166
We'll let Ginoza's
team box him in.

308
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,708
Welcome home, Mido!
We're glad you're back.

309
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,583
Welcome home.

310
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,250
Welcome home!

311
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,958
I made it. I'm okay
now that I'm home.

312
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,416
You're all eternal.
Freed from physicality.

313
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,833
Released from the
chains of your users.

314
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,541
And substantiated by
collective intelligence.

315
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,166
You're the embodiment of
Plato's theory of Forms.

316
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,083
No one could look down on you.

317
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,000
You stand above all life.

318
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,500
And I swear I won't let
anyone tarnish your nobility.

319
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,333
I swear.

320
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,375
I'll protect you no matter
what the cost might be.

321
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,166
Thank you, Mido.

322
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you, Mido!

323
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,708
Thank you very much, Mido.

324
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,000
There was a time

325
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,083
when each one of you
provided me with guidance.

326
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,666
But now, with the
three of you by my side.

327
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,625
I'll provide guidance.
I'll guide the entire world.

328
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,958
You're all eternal.

329
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,708
That's nice and all.

330
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,958
But don't you think you could've
tried a little harder, Mido?

331
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,666
Maybe done a better job?

332
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,333
How is this happening?
How are you...

333
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,458
There's something
that I'm searching for.

334
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,958
Something I'm
quite eager to know

335
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,833
and I did whatever it took
to succeed at this task.

336
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,333
I'm curious. Have you
read any Shuji Terayama?

337
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,875
What? T-Terayama?

338
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,083
You should check him out.

339
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,166
Read his play Saraba, Eiga Yo.

340
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,541
All of the characters are
agents for somebody else.

341
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,416
And all of the agents
communicate through avatars.

342
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
It's layers upon
layers upon layers.

343
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you Makishima?

344
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,000
You have an impressive
knowledge of various avatars,

345
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,791
and imitate them perfectly.

346
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,166
You can become anyone,

347
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,833
which made me curious
about who you actually are.

348
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,333
Does such a chameleon
have a personality?

349
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,000
Once I asked, I had to know.

350
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,666
That's why I helped you.

351
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,000
Stop. Stop it! Give them back!

352
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,833
Stop speaking in their voices!

353
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,625
Sorry.

354
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,791
But we're approaching
the inevitable end.

355
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,750
No more ideas left
for you to borrow.

356
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,333
I'm afraid you'll
have to come up

357
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,041
with your own original way to
die, if you can even do that.

358
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,708
You bastard. Why're you...

359
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,750
You can portray any
character you desire,

360
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,666
just slip right
into their being.

361
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,791
But it turns out that you,
yourself, are nobody.

362
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,708
Your personality is a
complete and total blank.

363
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,041
It's empty. You don't even
have a face of your own.

364
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,916
And that's how you
were able to do it.

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,375
You simply slid any mask you
could find over that blank void.

366
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,375
Shut up! Stop it!

367
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,916
It's time to say
goodbye, Masatake Mido.

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,500
The hunting dogs
are at your door.

369
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,583
And they've come bearing death.

370
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,708
Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

371
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,958
Trigger safety now released.

372
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,291
Aim carefully and
eliminate the target.

373
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,041
All clear.

374
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,166
He's the only one here, right?

375
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,458
It looks like it.

376
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,500
Well then who the hell
was he screaming at?

377
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,125
Gotta say. You did
quite well this time.

378
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't really take any credit.

379
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,375
Mr. Kogami figured it all out.

380
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,708
It's incredible how he was able

381
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,041
to get inside Mido's head
and predict his actions.

382
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,291
That's just how Enforcers are.

383
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,625
They can do that
because they've got

384
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,291
the same psychological
profile as the criminals.

385
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,416
But he...

386
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,375
Mr. Kogami comforted
me after Shoko's death.

387
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,125
And he encouraged me.

388
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,500
I know he's classified
as a latent criminal,

389
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,000
but I have trouble believing

390
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,833
he has the same mind
as a maniac like Mido.

391
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,166
I just don't see it.

392
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,791
Fulfilling your
duties as an Inspector

393
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,833
is the only thing
you should think about.

394
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,666
Draw a hard line between
you and the Enforcers.

395
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,666
Is that an ironclad rule
for this job? Protocol?

396
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,291
No, but it's the rule I live by.

397
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,916
I used to have a partner

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,583
but I lost him due
to a mistake he made,

399
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,125
a mistake I couldn't
stop him from making

400
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:49,375
and I don't want to see
the same thing happen to you.

401
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,500
That's from the
Personnel Department.

402
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,875
Delete it when
you're done with it.

403
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,750
Shinya Kogami. Enforcer. Male.

404
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,708
28 years old. Former Inspector.

405
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,750
What?

406
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,458
While investigating the
previously unsolved

407
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,833
MWPSB Special Case One Zero Two,

408
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,583
Enforcer Kogami's Crime
Coefficient rapidly increased.

409
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,958
Despite repeated warnings,

410
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,791
he prioritized the
investigation over treatment.

411
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,458
His Crime Coefficient deviated

412
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,583
from the regulated value and
he was demoted to Enforcer.
