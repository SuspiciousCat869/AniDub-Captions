1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,750
I've got good news, Mr. Ouryou.

2
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,541
Your daughter's come
to see you again.

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,541
Isn't that nice?

4
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,708
I'm sure this is hard.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,208
But your father does
know you're here

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,666
and it makes him happy,
even if he can't express it.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,375
You shouldn't get
discouraged, okay?

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,416
Yeah. Of course not.

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,416
It's all a big lie.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,875
Everyone here's the same.

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,000
They don't notice anything.

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,541
Don't say anything.

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,958
Don't think anything.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,916
They're just empty shells.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,083
Soon they'll
disappear altogether,

16
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,875
like the melting snow.

17
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,250
This epidemic leads innocent

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,208
and well-meaning
people to their deaths.

19
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,625
But its a pathogen that
will never be wiped out.

20
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,375
Because we're the
ones who create it.

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,666
The disease is serenity.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,916
A slow death we've
wished upon ourselves.

23
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,750
I've seen this.

24
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,250
The M.O.

25
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,000
First the killer dismembered
and cleaved open the body,

26
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,041
then used plastination to
turn it into a human specimen.

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,166
They brought their handiwork
right into the middle of town.

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,458
I have to take you off this
case, Kogami. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,916
Are you serious? How come?

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
I need people who
aren't clouded by their

31
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,083
own pre-conceived theories about
the case, at least at the start.

32
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,791
But sir. We're not
sure yet if this is

33
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,375
even connected to
the Specimen Case.

34
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,541
So I'm on standby at HQ?

35
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

36
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,666
Inspector Tsunemori.

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes sir?

38
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,583
It seems you know
the circumstances

39
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,083
we're dealing with.

40
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,041
I need you to keep an eye
on Kogami at all times now.

41
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,041
Make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid.

42
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,250
That's your job in this case.

43
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,958
Here's what we know.

44
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,250
A dismembered body was found

45
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,708
in a park in Daikanyama,
in the Shibuya Ward.

46
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,333
It's been identified
as Satsuki Kuzuhara.

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,166
She was a student
at Ousou Academy,

48
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,041
a higher education
boarding school for girls.

49
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,041
She went missing a week ago.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Hey wait a second--
Ousou Academy?

51
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,083
That's the school
where Kouzaburou Touma,

52
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,250
the suspect in the
Specimen case worked.

53
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,125
Isn't that right, sir?

54
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,000
The victim's body
was broken down

55
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,916
by a special kind of resin.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,541
It converts protein
into a plastic form.

57
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,375
Forensic analysis has confirmed
the resin is an exact match

58
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,541
to what was used in the
Specimen case three years ago.

59
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,125
We're likely dealing
with the same culprit.

60
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,208
So after three years of silence,

61
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,208
our homicidal maniac
has come back to play.

62
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,708
Gino. Can I be the heel who
asks the obvious question here?

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,083
Is it really smart to
pull Ko from the case?

64
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,000
He's been investigating
it all this time.

65
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,625
Wouldn't he be the best guy
to put things together?

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,500
I've read his entire report.

67
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,375
And the answer's no.
He's completely delusional.

68
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,625
That's enough.

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,750
I think you won.

70
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,041
Whoa!

71
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,500
You've got the
sparring program set

72
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,291
to the highest level there
is and you still crushed it.

73
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you sure you're
not a cyborg, Mr. Kogami?

74
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,583
I still get knocked out
cold from a Paralyzer.

75
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,791
I'm human, weak
like everyone else.

76
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,041
You do know Property Management
isn't gonna be happy about this.

77
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,916
It's their fault for
building that piece of crap.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,791
Is there a reason
you keep staring at me?

79
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,291
No, no! Sorry.

80
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,958
Um, but the Dominator
was designed

81
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,541
to neutralize any threat.

82
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,375
Do you really need
to spend so much time

83
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,166
in here on your combat training?

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,458
Damn right I do.

85
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,000
Its power just means
I have to train more.

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,208
A person should
always be stronger

87
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,791
than the weapon they hold.

88
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,791
It's not the Dominator
who kills someone,

89
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,875
it's the person
who pulls the trigger.

90
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,625
My training doesn't
let me forget that.

91
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,458
It keeps the pain here,
where it always should be.

92
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,833
I see. So is that supposed
to be a lesson for me?

93
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,250
If I have it my way you won't
have to take anyone's life.

94
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll carry that weight.

95
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,833
Did you come for a reason?

96
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,708
Okay I'll get to that,
but first can you wipe off

97
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,166
that sweat and
put a shirt on please?

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,541
It's about the unsolved murders.

99
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,250
MWPSB Special Case One Zero Two.

100
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,125
I did some
snooping into the case

101
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,333
without talking to
you first. I'm sorry.

102
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,875
Why are you sorry?

103
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,541
You mean you're not mad at me?

104
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,916
And what exactly would
I be mad at you for?

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,791
It's a murder case where one
of my subordinates was killed.

106
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,708
A case I haven't been able
to solve after three years.

107
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,291
If I was mad then
I'd be mad at myself.

108
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,416
And I've learned the hard way
that doesn't get me anywhere.

109
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Three years.

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,333
And I haven't even gotten close
to finding the real mastermind.

111
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,791
Kouzaburo Toma's puppeteer.

112
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,416
Do you think whoever committed

113
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,333
those crimes is behind
this murder, as well?

114
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,916
I don't know yet.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,041
It's always possible this is
the elaborate work of a copycat.

116
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,250
But it would be stupid not
to pursue the connection.

117
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,083
It must be hard, getting
pulled from the case.

118
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,833
I'm not done yet.

119
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,416
I just don't want to
get Gino in trouble.

120
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm saying there's
a way to do this right.

121
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,083
We just need a good pretext.

122
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,666
We have to create a situation
where they need our help again.

123
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,541
Do you think that's possible?

124
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,375
I'm sure. Just wait and see.

125
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,958
What was he like?
Enforcer Sasayama?

126
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,791
He was a real piece of work.

127
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,541
A womanizer, for starters.

128
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,666
Just ask Karanomori or
Kunizuka how many times

129
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,625
he grabbed their butts.

130
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,000
They always gave him
one hell of a punch.

131
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,541
And yet he never seemed
to learn his lesson.

132
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,250
He had a short temper, too.

133
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,166
And when he got upset there
was no calming him down.

134
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,875
One time he went to
the house of someone

135
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,458
who'd been flagged
by a Hue Check.

136
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,083
Went in and found the guy

137
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,333
on top of a woman
he had kidnapped.

138
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,166
Sasayama nearly
beat the man to death

139
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,250
with his bare hands.

140
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,625
I was an Inspector at the time,

141
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,583
so I had to stop him,
but deep down,

142
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,291
well, I don't
know how to put it.

143
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,458
He was an amusing guy.

144
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,958
A womanizing, violent bastard.

145
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,541
But he had heart
you couldn't contain.

146
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,375
I certainly never thought
he would die that way.

147
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,333
You see the picture of his body?

148
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,666
Yes.

149
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,708
And you read how the
killer posed his corpse

150
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,708
beneath a
Holographic illumination?

151
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,958
Yes.

152
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,291
Do you know what kind
of illumination it was?

153
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,208
Sorry, no, I don't.

154
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,000
It was an ad for a
pharmaceutical company.

155
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,333
"Safe stress care.

156
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,791
Taking you to a
world without suffering.

157
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,333
"Analysis showed that
before Sasayama was turned

158
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,625
into a plastic specimen,
he was dismembered

159
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,583
while he was still alive.

160
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,250
He felt every cut.

161
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,541
It's like the killer
was sending a message.

162
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,791
"There is no world
without suffering.

163
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,875
That's all life is."

164
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,750
I wanted that monster
to feel every stab

165
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,166
of pain he'd caused Sasayama.

166
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,041
Once I started
feeling like that,

167
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,708
there was no coming back and

168
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,750
from that day on my career
as an Inspector was over.

169
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,208
Do you regret going too far?

170
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,750
I can't regret being
involved in this case.

171
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,375
It's my job. My regret
is not solving it.

172
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
That's what I can't take.

173
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,750
Kozaburo Toma's accomplice
three years ago,

174
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,958
the man you say
is the mastermind.

175
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,291
Are there any leads

176
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,291
we might still be
able to use to find him?

177
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,583
Yeah.

178
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,958
There's a picture Sasayama took.

179
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,500
It's pretty blurry though.

180
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,958
He had the image
saved on his terminal.

181
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,541
This man in the picture.

182
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,458
Do you know anything more?

183
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:16,375
Only the file name for
the image. "Makishima."

184
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,916
That body in the park.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,458
It was Satsuki Kuzuhara.

186
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,791
Yeah, I heard that.

187
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,250
Yoshika's been absent from
school for two days now.

188
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,916
I heard that too.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,583
Hey, listen to me!
This is serious!

190
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,291
I am listening.

191
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,333
It's not just Yoshika.

192
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,666
I heard Masami Yamaguchi
in Class B is absent as well.

193
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,375
I get the sense that
something really terrible

194
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,000
is going on in this
academy. So what?

195
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,833
Do you not care?

196
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,416
My point is if there
is something bad

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,791
I wouldn't get involved.
I wouldn't gossip either.

198
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,458
It's not just gossip.

199
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,750
If we aren't careful we could
get into serious danger, too.

200
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,000
We can't stay quiet.

201
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,000
We've been friends with Yoshika
since we were little kids.

202
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,583
Rikako Ouryou.

203
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,125
What?

204
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,166
It seemed as if Yoshika
really liked her, didn't she?

205
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,375
And lately it's seemed

206
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,166
like Rikako was crazy
about Yoshika, too.

207
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,875
If you want to pry,
I'd bet she's the girl to ask.

208
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,250
Yeah.

209
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,375
Kierkegaard had a
philosophy my father liked.

210
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,250
He said man is
superior to animals

211
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,958
because man has two aspects,
the physical and the eternal.

212
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,083
But because man
must relate the finite

213
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,541
to the infinite,
man can be in despair.

214
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,041
If you can't know despair,
then you can't know hope.

215
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,541
My father used
dismembered bodies

216
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,083
as the subject of his paintings

217
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,958
to symbolize the contradictory
nature of the self.

218
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,708
I had so much
respect for my father.

219
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,625
He understood his
obligation as an artist,

220
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,541
and for years he tried
to use his creations

221
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
to enlighten humanity.

222
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,500
When it comes to talent,
I still think he was brilliant.

223
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,875
That's what makes it worse.

224
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,416
That's why I can't
forgive him for abandoning

225
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,541
his duty halfway through,

226
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,250
when he could have shown
the world so much more.

227
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,833
Yesterday.

228
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,541
My father passed away.

229
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,791
He's been dead for a long time,

230
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
really, his body
just didn't know it.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,333
But last night his heart finally
gave in to the inevitable.

232
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,708
It's okay, though.

233
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,250
I won't rip my clothes and cry.

234
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,458
I'm going to finish
what my father started,

235
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,541
and fulfill his obligation

236
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,541
to enlighten the
world with his art.

237
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,375
And you get to be part of it.

238
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,208
It's such an exciting time.

239
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,500
Right, Yoshika?

240
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,083
Eustress deficiency
cerebral infarction.

241
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,791
That won't be the official
entry on any death certificate,

242
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,458
but it is the most accurate.

243
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,375
It's said to be the real cause
of most deaths of this kind.

244
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,791
Officially.

245
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,541
They call it heart failure
from an unknown cause. Ha.

246
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,166
I've heard of this condition.

247
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,583
They say it's a side effect
of excessive stress care.

248
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,041
For some time researchers
have understood

249
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,958
that moderate stress
has beneficial effects.

250
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,500
It boosts the immune
system, for example.

251
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,708
Stress motivates us, and
prepares us for action.

252
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,583
It compels our body to survive.

253
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,000
However, routine
Psycho-Pass checks'

254
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,875
take our stress away from us.

255
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,333
There are patients whose
stress reaction is so numb.

256
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,708
They can't even recognize basic
stimulation of their senses.

257
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,583
Once that happens, it's a
neurological downward spiral.

258
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,375
They become like living corpses.

259
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,000
Eventually their autonomic
nervous system stops working,

260
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,416
and their vital
functions shut down.

261
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,125
It's sad what
we've become isn't it.

262
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,541
We are now capable
of caring for ourselves

263
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,583
to the point that we actually
regress as living beings.

264
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,333
We're killing ourselves
with good intentions.

265
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,625
And the fact is,
as remarkable as

266
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,041
our medical advancements
have been this century.

267
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
The average lifespan
is actually decreasing.

268
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,083
The statistics
make it very clear.

269
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,166
But the public will probably
never hear about that.

270
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
Well that's hardly shocking.

271
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,375
In this era, everything
that could be called

272
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,500
a true reason for living
has been methodically removed.

273
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,250
No one tries to talk seriously
about what life should be

274
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,583
anymore it's not
part of our culture.

275
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,666
The father of Rikako Oryo,
the girl I mentioned earlier.

276
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,708
He had eustress
deficiency as well.

277
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,208
Roichi Oryo.
At the peak of his career,

278
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,875
he was one of the most
celebrated artists alive.

279
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,333
Surely you've heard of him.

280
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm afraid not.

281
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,666
It's embarrassing,

282
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,291
but I'm rather ignorant
when it comes to art.

283
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,958
He was genius illustrator.

284
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,291
He created vivid,
cruel nightmares

285
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,416
using broken female
bodies as motifs.

286
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
From his art, you might assume
he was some twisted sadist.

287
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:53,208
But he was actually
a strictly moral man.

288
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,750
That's not uncommon,
that disconnect'

289
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,875
between the creator and the
impression their creations give.

290
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,375
But in Roichi's case, it was
rooted in a firm ideology.

291
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,375
According to him,
mankind could only

292
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,791
control the cruelty in our
nature by fully confronting it.

293
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,083
If he forced us

294
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,625
to look unflinchingly
at the darkest depths

295
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,416
of the human heart,
he could foster the goodwill

296
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,333
and reason necessary to
quell those baser impulses.

297
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,250
He believed his
artistic purpose was

298
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,333
to enlighten humanity
and challenge us to grow.

299
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,708
That's a lofty goal.

300
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,791
You make him sound
like quite the saint.

301
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,083
But then the world changed.

302
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,958
The spread of Pyscho-Pass
assessments made

303
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,791
that kind of
self-examination obsolete.

304
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,541
We didn't have to
control ourselves anymore.

305
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,708
The machine assessments

306
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,166
could maintain our
mental health for us.

307
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,791
And while the
technology robbed his art

308
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,708
of its purpose, I heard
Roichi actually welcomed it.

309
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,750
Like I said, he was a moral man,

310
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,333
and his own success
was never the point.

311
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,291
His ideal of humans having a
healthy mind had been achieved.

312
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,791
The way it happened
was irrelevant.

313
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,333
Still, it wasn't easy.

314
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,583
His mission was over, and his
life no longer had meaning.

315
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,666
He was welcoming the
change that would ruin him.

316
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,291
That's surprising.

317
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,583
Some artists say
they're above fame.

318
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,208
But I don't believe I've heard
of one who actually meant it.

319
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,041
Well part of him
meant it, at least.

320
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,375
Internally, he was conflicted.

321
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,416
And he resorted to all
sorts of state of the art

322
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,208
stress care methods to
quiet the growing turmoil.

323
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,750
His daughter tells me that he

324
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,875
became dependent on
the treatments over time.

325
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,875
Stress care was an addiction
he could not break.

326
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,583
Instead, it broke him,
didn't it?

327
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,041
Turned him into a living corpse
who couldn't even sit up in bed.

328
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,750
Considering how much
Rikako loved her father,

329
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,833
I imagine she felt his
decline was unforgivable.

330
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,458
It's as if Roichi Oryo
was killed twice.

331
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,625
First his talent was killed
by science and technology.

332
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,041
And then, his spirit was killed

333
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
by the culture that
technology created.

334
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,500
You mean this young
woman is committing

335
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,375
these horrific murders to
get revenge for her father?

336
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,958
Is that it?

337
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,958
Well, who can really know what
lies in another human's heart?

338
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,583
I just hope she finds
some meaning beyond revenge.

339
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,833
Choe Gu-Sung?

340
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,333
Well. That was quick.

341
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,458
Remarkable.

342
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,958
I wonder how Mr. Makishima
knew about this place

343
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,916
when no one at the
academy even realizes it exists.

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,541
Evidently it was an
old generator room

345
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,916
where they used to
boil down recyclables.

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,250
But when the
school was renovated,

347
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,458
it disappeared
from the blueprints.

348
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,500
Pretty sloppy, huh?

349
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,750
So did you bring me the resin?

350
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,708
Right over there.

351
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,416
Deliveries aren't
usually my thing.

352
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,458
But the payment this time,
well everyone has a price.

353
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,333
Not to mention I get to help a
cute young lady like yourself.

354
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,541
So, in other words

355
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,875
you won't be hearing
any complaints from me.

356
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,500
Where does Mr. Makishima

357
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,041
get this wonderfully
bizarre chemical, anyway?

358
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,708
Well he mentioned
something about them

359
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,250
being leftover from
past festivities.

360
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,666
Don't know who made it.

361
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,208
Honestly I don't want to.

362
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,750
But just imagine it.

363
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,625
A chemical that turns
living matter into plastic

364
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,125
doesn't have too many
practical applications.

365
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,458
I'd guess the inventor
thought amusing Mr. Makishima

366
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,166
was worth a lot more
than selling a patent.

367
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,333
It seems geniuses
who use their talents

368
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,916
for unsavory purposes are drawn
to him like nails to a magnet.

369
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,625
You're one of those nails,
aren't you. Choe Gu-Sung?

370
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,583
Don't know why it's that way.

371
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,625
But there's a feeling
working for him.

372
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,541
It's like reliving my childhood.

373
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,041
What mischief should we get

374
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,250
into next to turn
society on its head?

375
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,958
It's all I think about now.

376
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,916
I understand.
I feel the same way.

377
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,625
You and Mr. Makishima
provide the toys,

378
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,916
and we, the mischievous children

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,583
get to play a game of
"shake up the world."

380
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,500
The fun's addictive.
Don't you agree?

381
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,375
Well, for we who
run the toy store.

382
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,708
Just watching you brats
play is all the fun we need.

383
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,708
I see.

384
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,125
Then you're in luck,
because they should be

385
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,416
discovering my second bit
of mischief any moment.

386
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,375
You should keep
an eye on the news.

387
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,458
I tingle with anticipation.

388
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,416
It's a shame, though.

389
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,875
You always leave before
the real fun begins.

390
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,833
Are you sure you
don't want to stay?

391
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,541
Unfortunately, I'm a weenie
when it comes to blood.

392
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
A second kill.

393
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:06,625
If this is Kouzaburou Touma's
work, it's actually the sixth.

394
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,916
Kagami Kawarazaki.
Nice to see you.

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,708
So let's hear this
burning question.

396
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,333
It's about Yoshika.

397
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,833
Yoshika Okubo, she's gone
missing.

398
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:24,416
She's been absent from school
for three days in a row now. So.

399
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
You're worried about her.

400
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,166
You care about your friends
more than anything, don't you?

401
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,458
We've known each other
since we were little girls.

402
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,458
That's her!

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,250
Friendship between
girls can be wonderful.

404
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,333
Don't you think?

405
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,416
I have a feeling it could
become a very exciting motif.

406
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,750
I uh...

407
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,916
It could be a great addition
to my Yoshika piece.

408
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,125
I'm so glad you
chose to come by.

409
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,125
A touching reunion with
your childhood friend.

410
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:14,083
It plucks at the
heartstrings, doesn't it?

411
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,208
Why I think I could almost cry.

412
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,375
I want to recreate this
emotional scene in a place

413
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,708
where more and more people
can see it and be touched.

414
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,000
I guess that's the fate
of an artist, isn't it?

415
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,708
That ever-growing need
to share with the world.
