1
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,458
Please make your way inside.
And watch your step.

2
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,166
Where are you taking me?

3
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,250
What I'm about to show you...

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,416
...is the brain of our
world as well as its heart.

5
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,541
The brain of the world?

6
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,958
The food we eat every
day is thanks entirely...

7
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,625
...to this remarkable
technology.

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,833
And yet, most people

9
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,458
are completely unaware
of it, aren't they?

10
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,791
Indeed.

11
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
These days,
the world is brimming

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,625
with ignorant men and
women who take the blessings

13
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,791
of scientific
innovation for granted,

14
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,500
like they're entitled to it.

15
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,041
It's rare but refreshing to see
a young person like yourself

16
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,125
take such an
interest in the subject.

17
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,125
It's quite sad to
see you, the genius

18
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,291
who was at the forefront
of establishing Japan's

19
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,041
independent food supply,
retired and totally forgotten

20
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,250
by the very people
you've kept fed.

21
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,583
But what I'm interested most in

22
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:07,041
is the Uka-no-Mitama Virus'
antiquated security system.

23
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,625
Even if that pesticide is
good all you'd have to do

24
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,000
is change the target by
reconfiguring the sequencer.

25
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,500
And then, well, you could get it

26
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,583
to kill the oats themselves
instead of the pests.

27
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,333
Uka-no-Mitama would go
from a fertility god

28
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,166
who brings good harvest.

29
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,083
To a grim reaper who brings
only famine and death.

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,375
Hey, what is this?

31
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,916
On top of that, they
decided to convert a lab

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,625
in an old closed
down university.

33
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,375
Making it the control
center for the whole system.

34
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,958
It adjusts and
distributes the virus.

35
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,583
Now, of course,
this facility predates

36
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,708
the use of cymatic scans
as a means of defense.

37
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,958
Its security system must
rely on numeric passwords,

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,250
or at best, biometric scans.

39
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,833
And since you were
the boss there,

40
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,125
all I need is for
you to lend me a hand.

41
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,750
And then I can
break in with ease.

42
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,791
Right, Professor Kudama?

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,333
So that is the truth
about the Sibyl System.

44
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,041
Which is to say,
the truth about us.

45
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,000
Did Kagari die here
where I'm standing?

46
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,833
Did you kill him?

47
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,041
We evaluated and
compared the contribution

48
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,416
Shusei Kagari would make
to society throughout his life

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,708
versus the risk of him revealing
the secret of the Sibyl System,

50
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,166
and concluded that the
risk outweighed the good.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,666
That's ridiculous!

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,208
You say he wasn't worth it!

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,083
You couldn't judge Makishima!

54
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,708
You are useless!

55
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,250
You are partially right.

56
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,958
The appearance of criminally
asymptomatic people

57
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,541
whom the Sibyl System is
unable to analyze is inevitable.

58
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,083
No matter how thorough
and precise a system may be,

59
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,208
it must be assumed that a
certain number of irregularities

60
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,375
that deviate from the norm
will slip through the cracks.

61
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,958
And still you call
that a perfect system?

62
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,583
How can this thing decide
whether someone lives or dies?

63
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,708
If we only improve
the system by making it

64
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,916
more complex, we can
never expect perfection.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,750
There is no perfect
set of functions

66
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,208
that will encapsulate
all possible deviations.

67
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,166
We must instead
resolve contradictions

68
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,041
by altering the way we operate.

69
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,125
By permitting the existence of
anomalies that we cannot manage,

70
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,333
and taking measures
to coexist with them,

71
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,208
the system achieves
perfection in a practical sense.

72
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,625
What does that mean?

73
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,625
We must entrust the
management of the system

74
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,041
to the very same ones
who deviate from it.

75
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,541
That is the most
logical conclusion.

76
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,541
Back when we had individual
personalities and bodies,

77
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,291
we were all criminally
asymptomatic people who deviated

78
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,500
from the classification
structure of the Sibyl System.

79
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,041
There are many among our
ranks who have perpetrated acts

80
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,333
far more cruel than those
that Makishima has committed.

81
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait. Are you saying...

82
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,500
Sibyl's some monster made up
of evil people's brains

83
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,041
and this monster's
been running our world?

84
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,541
First we must reject
relative valuations

85
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,791
and labels, such
as "good" or "evil".

86
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,958
Only then can an absolute
system be established.

87
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,833
What society needs is a
perfect and infallible system.

88
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,833
Who manages it and how it
is managed are irrelevant.

89
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,416
That's just nonsense!

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,750
In a truly completed system,

91
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,291
the operator's will
is not questioned.

92
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,500
Rather, our will
itself is the system

93
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:45,083
and the universal standard of
value that transcends ethics.

94
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,208
This is crazy!

95
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,583
Who do you think you are?

96
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,125
Yes, it is true that each
and every one of us here

97
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,916
at one time had complications
with our personalities.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,250
However, we harmonize

99
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,750
through the act of integrating
everyone's minds,

100
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,875
and in doing so, have been
able to achieve the goal

101
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,875
of a universal standard.

102
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,791
The more rarefied and peculiar

103
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,416
the orientation
of the individual

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
who joins the system,
the more new ideas

105
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,541
and values it brings to
our collective perception.

106
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,458
And the more flexible

107
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,833
and diversified our
thinking can become.

108
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,333
In that regard, Shogo
Makishima's idiosyncrasy

109
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
would be quite valuable to us.

110
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,875
Thus we have high hopes

111
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,375
that he will become an
especially useful addition.

112
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,916
Attaining a logical
society in which

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,583
various contradictions and
inequalities are resolved.

114
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,291
That is, after all, the
ultimate happiness sought

115
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,916
by the rational human mind.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
By achieving an
absolutely perfect system,

117
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,250
Sibyl has transformed into
an entity that embodies

118
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,416
that ideal state of
balance and harmony.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,916
But why are you telling me?

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,291
Because you instinctively hate

121
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,750
and emotionally
detest us at the moment.

122
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,125
And yet you still cannot
deny the significance

123
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,458
and necessity of
the Sibyl System.

124
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
You accept the fact that the
current social order cannot,

125
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,833
and will not, be sustained
without the existence of Sibyl.

126
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,125
You place greater
importance on its necessity

127
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,250
than on its justifiability.

128
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,541
We highly value your standards.

129
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,125
But you said that you had

130
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,625
to kill Kagari in order
to keep your secrets.

131
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,250
Akane Tsunemori possesses
a sense of purpose

132
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,416
that is shared
by the Sibyl System.

133
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,583
Hence we decided that
the probability of you

134
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,458
revealing our
secrets to the world,

135
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,625
thus endangering the system
was infinitesimally small.

136
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,208
Don't treat me like a fool.

137
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,458
What you are...
You're just a...!

138
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,000
Allow us to make
our assertions clear.

139
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,666
Akane Tsunemori
would you prefer to live

140
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,208
in a world without
the Sibyl System?

141
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,333
Ah. You want to nod,
but yet you hesitate.

142
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,708
The idealized world you
fantasize about simply

143
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,750
isn't tangible enough at
this point for you to deny

144
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,750
the very real social order
we have managed to implement.

145
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,458
You recognize that the peaceful
society we currently enjoy,

146
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,583
thanks to a mix of happy
citizens and strict regulation,

147
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,125
is more important
than anything else.

148
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,208
So, no matter how
much you may hate

149
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,041
and resent the Sibyl System,

150
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
it still provides the
foundation for that harmony.

151
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,125
And you cannot reject it.

152
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,458
Don't talk like you know
everything about me.

153
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,291
If we analyze your reaction,
as read by the cymatic scan,

154
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,500
we can clearly grasp
everything there is to know.

155
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,083
Quit acting brave

156
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,250
and let us have a
heart-to-heart discussion.

157
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,625
The goal of this meeting is

158
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,750
to establish a collaborative
relationship between us.

159
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,875
Collaborative?

160
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,416
CID Division One
is in a state of crisis.

161
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,583
Due to Shinya Kogami's
recklessness

162
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,500
and Nobuchika Ginoza's
psychological exhaustion,

163
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,250
the team is starting to
show signs of dysfunction.

164
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,708
Unless a new leader steps up

165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,041
and takes the reins
in this investigation,

166
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,916
we cannot expect success in
tracking down Shogo Makishima.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,208
Mister Ginoza, exhausted?

168
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,666
Akane Tsunemori.

169
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,708
Because you were mired in
unnecessary inner conflict,

170
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,458
you have not been
able to achieve

171
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,291
your true potential
as of late, either.

172
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,833
Your inability to fully
understand the situation

173
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,458
has been clouding
your decision-making.

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,541
That is ultimately the reason
why we made an exception

175
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
in your case and
revealed to you the secret

176
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,083
behind the Sibyl System.

177
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,083
We arrived at the
conclusion that telling you

178
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,125
the truth was the best
way to clear your head

179
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,958
and to motivate
you moving forward.

180
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,458
Akane Tsunemori, you too
disagree with Shinya Kogami

181
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,625
seeking to personally
punish Shogo Makishima.

182
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,458
So you see, we share
the common goal of wanting

183
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,125
to prevent a senseless death

184
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,583
from happening due
to unchecked emotions.

185
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,875
I think that Makishima's
crimes should be

186
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,250
judged through
proper channels, that's all.

187
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,875
And the same goes for you guys,

188
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,750
if any of you broke the law
in the past then you should be

189
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,291
punished for your
actions accordingly.

190
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,541
Our contributions to society
are more than enough

191
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,375
to compensate for any damages
we may have caused in the past.

192
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,458
Isn't that convenient.

193
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,125
My entire future will
be set in stone

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,208
in less than three minutes.

195
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,333
How depressing.

196
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,500
Come on, Yuki.

197
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,708
Your score on the final exam

198
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,166
couldn't have
been that terrible.

199
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,125
Oh, it was the worst.

200
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,083
I wonder what kind of crummy
job I'll get stuck with.

201
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,833
But if we were living in
the days before Sibyl

202
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,375
our destinies would've
just been left to chance.

203
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,541
So if you think about it,
we're a lot better off now.

204
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,041
I envy you.

205
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,541
You're bound to wind up with
a bunch of aptitudes, Kaori.

206
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,041
You get to choose
what you wanna do.

207
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,791
Hey, it's not like
I did as well as Akane.

208
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,916
Did you see the
score that she got?

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,166
She scored seven hundred.
Can you believe that?

210
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,375
I've always just been kinda
lucky when it comes to tests.

211
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,541
That's all.

212
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,875
With your score and
Psycho-Pass, Akane.

213
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,750
Yup, you've got a
rosy life ahead of you.

214
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,541
Yeah, you really think so?

215
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,875
It's here! Woah, my rank is "C".

216
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,375
I knew it was coming
but, still, I'm in shock.

217
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,666
It looks like mine are
all dull office jobs.

218
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Not much room for advancement.
I better get used to it.

219
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,083
Hey, Akane, what
about you? How'd you do?

220
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,958
Let's see, come on!

221
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,250
Woah, no way!

222
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,416
You've got an aptitude for
all of the central ministries!

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,750
These results.

224
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,166
You know, they really
are something incredible.

225
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,500
You could even work for the PSB!

226
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,583
But don't you see?

227
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,416
If they recommend any
job and every job for me,

228
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,041
then how can I know
which one's the best fit?

229
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,875
I mean, which one of
these choices is the job

230
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,625
that I'm meant to do?

231
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,166
How the hell should I know?

232
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,958
Why would you
even ask my opinion?

233
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,875
You could've become
anything you wanted.

234
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,583
Chosen any kind of life
there is a person could live.

235
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,083
Probably agonized
over all your options.

236
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,333
It's incredible.

237
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,291
It's like you're one of
those people from back

238
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,916
before Sibyl was created.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
Yeah, it is.

240
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,333
Everyone used to have
to feel their way around

241
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,125
and choose their own life.

242
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,666
To think that a world
where such things

243
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,666
were natural once existed.

244
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,208
You might not be aware of this,

245
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,708
but most suckers these
days don't have any choice.

246
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,666
They just get pegged
into whatever position

247
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,833
the Sibyl System thinks
they're right for.

248
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,291
And yet, here you are with all
the options in the world.

249
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,833
Talking about making
sense of your life and

250
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,708
finding your purpose
in the universe.

251
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:25,291
I guess sometimes
I do stress out about it.

252
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,083
But now I feel like, maybe it's
a blessing and a luxury for me

253
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,125
to be able to worry about
having so many opportunities.

254
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,541
I think people only
have real value

255
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,333
when acting on their
own impulses and desires.

256
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,625
So I've asked a number of people

257
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,583
to tell me about their
suppressed free will.

258
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,625
I encourage them I facilitate.

259
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,666
And then I watch for
the truth to play out.

260
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,750
Funny. I might actually be able
to understand how you feel now.

261
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,375
There's a good
conversation starter.

262
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,125
How do we define criminal?

263
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,958
Maybe that Dominator
you're holding?

264
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,625
Shall we allow the
Sibyl System that governs it

265
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,458
to decide what I am?

266
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,166
That's wrong, isn't it?

267
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,916
That's how we messed up
in the first place.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,583
By reading a bio-organism's
force field using a cymatic scan

269
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,125
people have found a way
to analyze a person's mind.

270
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,708
The intelligence of science

271
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,500
finally uncovered the
secret of our souls.

272
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,916
And society changed
because of it.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,458
But, there's a problem.

274
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,666
Free will has been
stripped from the equation.

275
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,958
If man's not judged by will then

276
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,666
how are we really deciding
who's good and who's evil?

277
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,291
I don't think the
important thing

278
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,875
was the final verdict
of good or evil.

279
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,708
I feel like it was to
think about yourself

280
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,208
agonize over it and accept it.

281
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,750
I'm talking about seeing

282
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
the naked splendor
of people's souls.

283
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,500
I want to see our precious lives

284
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,000
played out on the
stage of the world.

285
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,333
But how can our souls

286
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,291
be precious if
they're not utilized?

287
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,458
If we base our lives
around Sybil's Oracle,

288
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,333
and not
our own free will.

289
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,208
Then can our souls have value?

290
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,958
Of course they can!

291
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,208
You think you
decide their worth?

292
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,833
You judge their friends?
Their family?

293
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,541
The value of a happiness
you've never felt?

294
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,416
It was fun and pretty easy.

295
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,333
I didn't experience
any difficulty at all.

296
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,041
Someone else always
took care of things for me.

297
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,708
And I was never even
forced to ask myself

298
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,833
what was important to me.

299
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,250
Say, Akane, do you think
I was able to be happy,

300
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,375
going through life that way?

301
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,708
I think you
could've become happy.

302
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,125
You could've searched
for the answer at any time.

303
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,583
As long as you're
alive, anybody can.

304
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,375
Tsunemori speaking.

305
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,791
Where the hell did
you wander off to?

306
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,416
We're in crisis mode.

307
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,833
Right, well.

308
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,916
The Chief had me
deliver something

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,791
to the Ministry of Welfare.

310
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,916
There's been a
murder in Ichikawa.

311
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,416
Kogami's prints were
found at the scene.

312
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,375
Get here, quick.

313
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,625
I understand. I'll be
there as soon as I can.

314
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,375
Sibyl System.
You hear me, right?

315
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,916
I'll go along and do
whatever you want me to do,

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,416
but only under one condition.

317
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,625
We're listening.

318
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,166
If I bring Shogo
Makishima in alive,

319
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,791
then you have to guarantee
Shinya Kogami's life in return.

320
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,000
Withdraw his execution order.

321
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
An odd request as
those two things

322
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,750
are not logically equivalent.

323
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,750
Yeah, well I don't really
care about your stupid logic.

324
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,291
If Mister Kogami isn't spared
then I won't do anything

325
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,541
to stop Makishima from dying.,
If push comes to shove,

326
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,291
I'll kill him myself.

327
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,708
So, what's next?

328
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,541
Are you gonna kill me too
for disobeying your order?

329
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,375
Go ahead. Murder me just
like you murdered Kagari.

330
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,541
Of course, then you'll have
to find yourself another pawn

331
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,583
who you think can
do your bidding.

332
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,916
We accept.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,375
However, only once Shogo
Makishima is captured alive

334
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,250
will we grant an exception
for Shinya Kogami.

335
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,083
It's a deal.

336
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,458
What took so long?

337
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,500
Sorry everyone.
What happened here?

338
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,875
Some of the neighbors.

339
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,583
They reported seeing
a guy walking around

340
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,333
in one of those helmets.

341
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,625
So we went door-to-door
asking questions.

342
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,541
Got to this house.
Only one with a security breach.

343
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,916
So. We rushed in
and found this mess.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,666
The victim is Nobuaki Kudama.

345
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,166
He used to run a lab belonging

346
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,666
to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry.

347
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
But he retired
from that years ago.

348
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,416
At the time of his death he
was just an ordinary pensioner.

349
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,916
The house appears
to have been searched.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,541
And there's Kogami's prints.
But why on earth.

351
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
This wound.

352
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,000
It may have been
Makishima who did it.

353
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,333
What if this old man
had something

354
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,708
to do with
Makishima's next plot?

355
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,500
And Mister Kogami figured
it out and raced here,

356
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,208
but was too late?

357
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,875
So that means.

358
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,291
Kogami really is ahead
of us on this one, huh?

359
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,500
All right, but even so.

360
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
What motive could
Makishima possibly have

361
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,750
for killing this old timer?

362
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,458
Gonna be a pain to analyze a
scene as trashed as this.

363
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,666
What would
Mister Kogami consider

364
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,916
to be the least
desirable outcome?

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Letting Makishima
get away again, right?

366
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,875
Okay, and what would be
his second greatest concern?

367
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,833
Being tracked
down by us too soon

368
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,166
before he can kill this guy. No?

369
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,750
That sounds right.

370
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,583
So let's look at things
with that order in mind.

371
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,166
Say Mister Kogami got
here well before we did.

372
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,291
What if he had just hidden

373
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,708
the body somewhere
we'd never find it?

374
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,291
While Nobuaki Kudama
remained missing.

375
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,458
We would've wrongly moved on,
losing the trail, and

376
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,500
Mister Kogami would've
had a longer lead.

377
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:29,250
That would've been the
surest way to buy some time.

378
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,833
And yet, he didn't do that.

379
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,250
Mister Kogami isn't
one to be overconfident.

380
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,000
Just on the off chance that
he might fail in his mission.

381
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,166
I think he'd probably
leave behind a clue.

382
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,166
So at least someone

383
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,750
could stop Makishima.

384
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,291
The question is, how long will
it take us to find that clue.

385
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,791
He's testing us with this.

386
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,000
To see if we have
the tenacity it takes

387
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,375
to pursue Makishima
and bring him to justice.

388
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,333
If we don't show that
level of determination,

389
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
we'll be stranded here
and get a late start.

390
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,166
Focus the scan on
his neck and eye wounds.

391
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
Start there.

392
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,375
A metal object has been
detected in the victim's airway.

393
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,791
Get me gloves.

394
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,125
Hey, wait. Leave
that to forensics.

395
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,791
What, and allow Mister
Kogami to buy more time?

396
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,416
If we wanna catch up to him,
we gotta do this now.

397
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,958
Rinse it off.

398
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,958
It's audio data.

399
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,125
This is Shinya Kogami.

400
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,416
I'm a former Enforcer and
I'm leaving this message

401
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,666
for the detectives who are bound
to show up here sooner or later.

402
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,375
Son of a...

403
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,333
The victim is Nobuaki Kudama,
a retired Doctor of Agriculture.

404
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,125
He was in charge of
a team developing the

405
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,458
Ukanomitama Virus, a disease
countermeasure for hyper-oats.

406
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,166
He's considered to
be the greatest factor

407
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,166
in Japan creating a
self-sufficient food supply.

408
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,666
Shogo Makishima must've
gotten some sort of idea

409
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,416
on how to destroy
the granary in Hokuriku

410
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,791
from Professor Kudama and then
he slashed the old man's throat.

411
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,625
He also gouged
out both eyeballs.

412
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,833
Then he chopped off all the
fingers at their second joints.

413
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,750
These may be needed to
bypass some form of security.

414
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,708
A facility from the
old days would rely

415
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,958
on outdated biometric
scanners instead

416
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,958
of the cymatic scans
we use today.

417
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,541
The lab Kudama's research
team was working out

418
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,125
of at Eezumo University
looks suspicious.

419
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,250
The lab's been
converted into a factory

420
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,416
and control center for
the Ukanomitama Virus.

421
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,166
I suspect that's
Makishima's next target.

422
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,750
Completely wiping out
our main food supply.

423
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,750
We're talking bioterrorism!

424
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,750
We need to hurry.
We can still catch up to them.

425
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,041
Well. Shall I begin?
