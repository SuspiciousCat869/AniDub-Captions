1
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,791
Uh, hi, can we help you?

2
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,416
I need you to give me the
medicine written on this paper.

3
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,375
Sorry we can't give this to you.

4
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,500
Psychotropic substances
are only administered

5
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,250
at authorized facilities,
and besides

6
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,875
you'd need a prescription,
biological data

7
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,708
You don't get it, do you?

8
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,083
Help me!

9
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,041
Someone, please, help!

10
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,958
No one is coming to save you.

11
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,875
Come on, give me
the medicine, lady!

12
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,208
Your attention, please.

13
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,250
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

14
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,875
of the Public Safety Bureau.

15
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,208
For your protection,

16
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,041
access to this block
is currently restricted.

17
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,500
Please, keep moving.
Do not stop.

18
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
Hey, there.

19
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,791
I think I know what's going
through your head right now.

20
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,000
But Mister Kogami...

21
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,791
But today just focus
on the case at hand.

22
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,333
Okay. Got it.

23
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,916
All right, talk to me.
What do we have?

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,875
Well. Let's see uh.

25
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,833
The crime itself was
about as straightforward

26
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,083
as these kinds of things get.

27
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,416
The perp waltzed right through

28
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,666
the door like he
owned the place,

29
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,125
killed the two pill jockeys,
helped himself

30
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,166
to whatever meds he
came here looking for today

31
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,333
and then calmly walked out
as if nothing happened.

32
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,166
The security cameras were able
to capture the whole ordeal.

33
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,125
Someone, please, help!

34
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,375
What is up with that
freaky helmet there?

35
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
You know he's suspicious
just by looking at him.

36
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,250
Maybe, but just
looking suspicious

37
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,541
isn't enough to
set off any alarms.

38
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,875
From the moment he set
foot in the pharmacy,

39
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,041
his Psycho-Pass
showed a normal value

40
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,833
and his Hue remained clear.

41
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,500
The log is recorded
on the scanner, too.

42
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,833
Oh, great, does that mean
we've got another freak

43
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,416
like that Makishima
guy on our hands?

44
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,208
Someone who can commit
cold-blooded murder

45
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,333
while keeping his
Psycho-Pass normal?

46
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,500
I'm thinking the
helmet is the key here.

47
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,333
It must have some
bypass feature.

48
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,125
It's deceiving
the cymatic scans.

49
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,458
The man who got the jump
on Inspector Tsunemori,

50
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:07,291
this Makishima he might've
used a similar device.

51
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,541
Wait. Are you serious?

52
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,375
Are you saying that a
stupid helmet could be

53
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,750
all somebody needs to
fake their Psycho-Pass?

54
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,875
If it was simply blocking
the cymatic scan,

55
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,375
that would be tech
I could understand.

56
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,333
But, of course, that
alone wouldn't be enough

57
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,875
to get past security.

58
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,625
Because if someone who couldn't
be scanned tried to enter,

59
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,250
an alarm would
go off immediately.

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,458
The problem we have here is
that the scanner successfully

61
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,041
detected the
intruder's Psycho-Pass,

62
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:41,416
and yet somehow it determined
he had the clear Hue of a fine,

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,541
upstanding citizen who
couldn't even hurt a fly.

64
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
So did he crack the system then?

65
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,375
No, that's just not possible.

66
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,333
The attack didn't seem
to be premeditated

67
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,541
and everything happened
in a short period of time.

68
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,250
There's no way for
someone to alter the data

69
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,750
without leaving
any kind of trace.

70
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,958
The current security
system is founded

71
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,250
on the assumption that a
cymatic scan is reliable.

72
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,000
It's because of that
assumption that anyone

73
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:07,250
whose Psycho-Pass checks out is
considered incapable of causing

74
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,875
and is let in there's no risk.

75
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,291
Even when actual
assaults or thefts occur

76
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,208
the Drones' AI isn't
equipped with the ability

77
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,166
to identify such
actions as crimes.

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,291
Since everyone's
Psycho-Pass is scanned,

79
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,958
their judgment's based on that.

80
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,916
That means we don't
have any methods left

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
to prevent crimes like this.

82
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,375
Nothing. This whole
city is unprotected.

83
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,875
Yeah, exactly.

84
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,541
So I told him,
"That's not my job, okay?

85
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,958
Get somebody else
to do that for you."

86
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,083
After that, he just had
this stupid look on his face,

87
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,208
like he didn't know whether
to yell or cry it was awful

88
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,750
Hey. What do you want with me?

89
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,791
I detect that you
are experiencing

90
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,458
a high level of stress.

91
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,500
It is recommended that
you seek help immediately

92
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,000
from a specialized
mental health facility.

93
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,291
Are you distressed?

94
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,500
The Ministry of
Welfare's Urban Service

95
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,000
helps everyone lead a
happier and healthier life.

96
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,583
Has someone been injured
or suddenly become ill?

97
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,833
Would you like to
request an ambulance

98
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,208
from the nearest
emergency hospital?

99
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,625
Please be advised
that you will be charged

100
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,125
an uninsured service
fee at a later date.

101
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,916
Now that right there is some
phenomenal stuff. So brutal.

102
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,375
In the old days, it was normal

103
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,791
for people to physically
lock their front doors

104
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,750
because the doubting of others

105
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,875
was the basis for
maintaining order then.

106
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,250
Did you get that

107
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,833
from one of Mister Masaoka's
stories about the past?

108
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,666
Yeah. Guess they're
not totally useless.

109
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,875
Anyway, Now we
don't have to doubt,

110
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,125
or approach other people
with cautious skepticism.

111
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,958
You know that those
strangers you see

112
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,416
on the street aren't going to
hurt you because each one

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,125
of them has had their
Psycho-Pass verified.

114
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,541
This society maintains its
order based on that assumption.

115
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,333
But if, like that helmeted
man, people come

116
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,666
to find out that there's a way
to deceive the cymatic scans,

117
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,750
there'll be panic.

118
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,875
Yeah that's true,

119
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,083
or if word gets out about
the existence of Makishima.

120
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,958
What is it?

121
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,833
An elevated Area
Stress Level warning's

122
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,000
been issued in
the Setagaya Ward.

123
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,208
But shelving that for now

124
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,125
there's a rather
disturbing video

125
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,625
that's just been uploaded
on the net. Here, look.

126
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,500
What the hell?
What is going on here?

127
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,708
It's begun.

128
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,083
This is just. What's happening?

129
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,041
Makishima is behind this
crime. I'd bet anything on it

130
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,708
Of course

131
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,250
I'm not even sure what crime
is in this world anymore.

132
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Ko, what're you thinking?

133
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,458
This isn't just some random act.

134
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:57,666
It's more like a seismic event
that shakes our very foundation.

135
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,500
Woah, that's crazy

136
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,458
When they said they
were gonna demo it,

137
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458
they weren't messin' around.

138
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,333
We should go now.

139
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
Impressive how much
the Area Stress Level

140
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,166
has elevated in
such a short time.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,125
Hello.

142
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,333
This will work.

143
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,708
The plan doesn't
need to be revised.

144
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,583
You're being ridiculous.

145
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,666
It's just one person
killing another, that's all.

146
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,875
Nothing particularly
serious has happened yet.

147
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,458
The really serious stuff
is yet to come.

148
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,416
Listen. You're the only one

149
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,208
who I've shared the
entire plan with.

150
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,166
I'm counting on you.

151
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,000
Your attention, please.

152
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,125
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department...

153
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,625
The victim's name
is Hiroko Fujii.

154
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,833
Hard to believe that goes down

155
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,708
in the middle of
a crowded street.

156
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,416
What the hell
happened to this city?

157
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,041
I tell you, it's outta control.

158
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,541
Do you think it's
the same perpetrator

159
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,291
from the pharmacy attack?

160
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,958
Well, I'd say
it's more than likely.

161
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,166
He's getting more
brazen, though.

162
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,500
Doing it in front
of all these people.

163
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,208
And how could they
just stand there?

164
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,875
The witness testimonies all
sound pretty much the same.

165
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,041
They say they
couldn't understand

166
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,791
what they were seeing.

167
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't think we can judge them.

168
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,500
Someone getting killed
right in front of you.

169
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,083
You can't imagine it.

170
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,125
The idea wouldn't
cross your mind.

171
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,041
Every one of these
people had gone

172
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,708
through their lives
without ever considering it.

173
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,166
We all grew up believing
this wasn't possible.

174
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,000
And in the end, not a single

175
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,166
one felt the need
to report the incident,

176
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,083
so the elevated Area
Stress Level warning

177
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,833
was the only way we were able
to know something was wrong.

178
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,375
Yeah, but humans weren't alone

179
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
in missing what
was in front of them.

180
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,625
Of all things, he kills the girl

181
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,875
right under a
Psycho-Pass scanner.

182
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,916
So, does that mean any
change in the culprit's Hue

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,916
would've been
monitored in real time?

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Yeah I'm pulling it up now.

185
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,458
He managed to maintain
a normal value yet again?

186
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,416
Unbelievable.

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,833
Even at the moment when
he's striking her dead,

188
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,083
it registers only
a minor fluctuation.

189
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,125
Is there any chance
that the value itself

190
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,500
could've been faked this time?

191
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,791
No way.

192
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,250
Fabricating a Psycho-Pass
just isn't possible.

193
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,958
Unless he's lugging
around a supercomputer.

194
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,458
Hey wait a second.
Now this is really bizarre.

195
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,291
Yeah, his value makes no sense.

196
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,833
It's more than that.

197
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,166
It looks too much like
an onlooker's reaction.

198
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,750
Check this out.

199
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,000
That graph there charts
the Area Stress Level.

200
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,875
It matches up perfectly with the
change in the murderer's Hue.

201
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,000
Whoa you're right.

202
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,083
If that's true,
this guy's mental state

203
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,541
was the exact same as the
witnesses watching him kill her.

204
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,875
I wonder if they'll be able

205
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,416
to see through that
little trick right away.

206
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,166
This is a simple
but impressive trick.

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,250
Although I'm afraid it can
be a bit limited, as well.

208
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,208
I think the reception range
is only about thirty meters.

209
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,208
But if there's even one
person within that range

210
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,333
who has a clear color.

211
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,041
Then it doesn't matter what

212
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,208
you're thinking
inside the helmet,

213
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,875
or what you do while wearing it.

214
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,375
The folks at the CID
will probably notice soon

215
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,208
that there was another
person in the vicinity

216
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:44,125
with the exact same Hue,
assuming they comb through

217
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,916
the scan data of everyone
who was at the scene.

218
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,708
Inspectors, we've got
another emergency.

219
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,000
What is it this time?

220
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,500
There are reports
that an armored car

221
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,208
was attacked on the freeway.

222
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,125
An armored car?
They must be crazy.

223
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,375
Hey, Shion, the
guys who did this

224
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,958
were wearing
helmets, too, right?

225
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,166
Excellent guess. Yes, they were.

226
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,250
There were three of them and
they were armed with shop tools.

227
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,458
This case is separate
from the one you're working.

228
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,916
How do we proceed?

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,333
We'll split up into
two separate teams.

230
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,416
Kagari and Kunizuka,
I want you to come with me.

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,541
You got it.

232
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,041
You guys keep looking
for the pharmacy attacker.

233
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
We'll go after the
armored car hijackers.

234
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,458
Hey, so these guys are
armed with real weapons, huh?

235
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,666
Which means that if this
thing doesn't work on them,

236
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,916
we're gonna be totally
outmatched and defenseless,

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,083
isn't that right, Gino?

238
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,291
Just focus on what
needs to be done here.

239
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,875
Now let's go.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,041
I have to wonder, why would
our suspect do all of this?

241
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,958
Well the most
common reason would be...

242
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,791
What is it?

243
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,958
I can't believe we missed that.

244
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,541
Since the crimes are
so unusual of course,

245
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,416
they appear to be
totally random at first.

246
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,333
But the second attack...

247
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,916
Brutality like that
only makes sense

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,083
if the killer had a motive.

249
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,166
What now?
Don't they know I'm busy?

250
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,000
Can you check something for me?

251
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,208
I'm kinda in the middle

252
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,500
of checking a whole
lotta things right now.

253
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,791
It'll just take a second.

254
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,875
I'm only asking
you 'cause you're

255
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,208
the goddess of
information analysis.

256
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,958
Sweetie, when it comes to me,

257
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,375
flattery will get
you whatever you want.

258
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,208
What is it?

259
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,958
The victim, Hiroko Fujii.

260
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,750
She have any sort
of trouble in her past?

261
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,250
If she did, it wasn't anything
big enough to go on her record.

262
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,875
What about people she knew?

263
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,625
Anyone who hasn't
gone outside in a while?

264
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,541
You're looking
for a shut-in now?

265
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,791
Not a shut-in.

266
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm looking for somebody
who knows he'd be sent

267
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,458
to therapy immediately

268
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,333
if he gets anywhere
near a street scanner.

269
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,250
Oh okay. I gotcha.

270
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,291
How about this guy?
Name's Jyunmei Itoh.

271
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,291
He's one of her
colleagues, or he was.

272
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,375
It seems he's been out
sick for about two weeks,

273
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,916
so he's been issued
a health care directive.

274
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,666
He lives in Tsurumaki.

275
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,625
That's not far from here.

276
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,125
He ain't home?

277
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,083
Bingo.

278
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,625
If this is the state of mind
this creep's been in lately

279
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,208
then it's no wonder he was
afraid to leave the apartment.

280
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,208
Crime Coefficient: Thirty-Two.

281
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,333
Target is a
registered Inspector.

282
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
We have to follow him!

283
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,250
Before we do that I need
to check something out.

284
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,583
Crime Coefficient: Thirty-Two.

285
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,375
Target is a
registered Inspector.

286
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,291
Warning: Any rebellious
conduct by an Enforcer...

287
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,416
Ah, so that's how they do it.

288
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,791
I figured out their
little magic trick.

289
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,083
Shion! Any uninhabited
blocks near me?

290
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,916
Why, what's this all about?
What's going on?

291
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,291
The suspect's able to copy the
Psycho-Pass of a nearby person.

292
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,583
The helmet itself is
doing a cymatic scan

293
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,250
of the people around him.

294
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,166
I see, so if we can
get him somewhere

295
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,375
with no people in
the scanning range

296
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,000
That helmet will
be useless. Hurry!

297
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,458
Let's see here.

298
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,958
There's a storage
building four blocks up.

299
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,375
It's fully automated
so nobody's inside.

300
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,208
We'll chase him to it.
Send any Drones in the area.

301
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,666
Yup, you got it.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,583
You heard the plan right pops?

303
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,625
Go circle around
and cut him off!

304
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,000
Copy.

305
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,000
As for you, Inspector,
don't get too close to Itoh.

306
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,416
Otherwise, we'll have
the same problem as before.

307
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,666
Got it!

308
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,333
Your attention, please.

309
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,750
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

310
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,500
part of the
Public Safety Bureau.

311
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,791
We are currently...

312
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,458
This is the Criminal
Investigation Department,

313
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,041
part of the Public
Safety Bureau.

314
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,083
We are currently blocking
traffic due to an emergen

315
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,291
Keep it up, guys!

316
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,666
You're almost there!

317
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,083
We are currently
blocking traffic due

318
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,125
to an emergency situation.

319
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,958
Please take an alternate route.

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,375
Crime Coefficient:
two hundred eighty-two.

321
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,041
Target is a registered Enforcer.

322
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,916
Damn it!

323
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,333
Status, Enforce At Will Target.

324
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,125
Trigger safety now released.

325
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,833
Aw, gee, how kind of you.

326
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,416
All the way up to two hundred
eighty-two now, are you?

327
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,291
Yeah. The thought of killing
him may have crossed my mind.

328
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,541
How you like seeing someone

329
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,750
with your Psycho-Pass
getting shot down?

330
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:52,708
Hey, I'm just glad this thing
didn't turn into an Eliminator.

331
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,250
It looks as though you
were able to lose your tail.

332
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,875
Yeah, piece of cake.

333
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,458
When they can't use
their Dominators,

334
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,875
the MWPSB are harmless.

335
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,708
You wanna know something?

336
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,875
You aren't very smart.

337
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,875
I mean you gotta be
either stupid or crazy

338
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,708
to meet us here alone like this.

339
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,041
Now we know you
got goods and money.

340
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,791
And you know we're dangerous.

341
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,791
You shoulda' taken precautions.

342
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,750
This was merely a tool
to promote awareness.

343
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,208
To encourage those people
to live like human beings,

344
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,625
and to stop trudging
through their sad,

345
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,750
idle lives like livestock.

346
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,833
The masses have
been misled by Sibyl.

347
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,166
They've forgotten how to assess
the danger in front of them.

348
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,083
Well in that sense
they're like you.

349
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,041
You're every bit as naïve
as those pitiful sheep.

350
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,291
Oh, is that so?

351
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:18,916
Alas it really is
quite a terrible shame.
