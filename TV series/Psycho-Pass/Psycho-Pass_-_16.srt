1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,583
I'm checking for areas

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,791
with the most power
consumption in this tower.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,541
Looks like two spots.

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,666
One on the top floor,
one in the basement.

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,583
Which one has what we're after?

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,791
There's a radio tower
located on the roof,

7
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,375
so the heightened
power consumption up

8
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,958
there's to be expected.

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,458
However, even from here,

10
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,791
we can't see any details of
the underground facilities.

11
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:43,208
This display only seems to show
down to basement level four.

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,875
Yes, but you know the early
blueprints for the building

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,000
had the basement extending
down twenty floors.

14
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,250
That's our best bet.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,833
Something wrong?

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,041
An MWPSB vehicle's
already headed our way.

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,583
I'd bet anything it's
Shinya Kogami. Not a surprise.

18
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:10,000
We should split up now. I'll
go upstairs and you go down.

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,458
Are you sure? Considering
what we're looking for.

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,541
I know Kogami, he's
going to come after me.

21
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,333
So I should create a diversion
while you do the work.

22
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,416
Choe Gu-Sung. I have very
high expectations for you.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,375
I understand. Leave it to me.

24
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:32,125
Well. The party's finally
coming to its conclusion.

25
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,916
Gotcha, Shogo Makishima!

26
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,833
A reckless move breaking
into the Ministry's own tower.

27
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,583
The communications unit's
been disconnected!

28
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,541
Hey, Shion.

29
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,291
How's it going down there?

30
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,333
About to become a warzone.

31
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,875
Can you access the
security cameras

32
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,916
in Nona Tower
from your terminal?

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,458
The Ministry of Welfare's

34
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,291
a little outside my
clearance, you know.

35
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,458
So you can't do it?

36
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,958
Oh, I can do it
if I'm authorized

37
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,291
to go through a back door.

38
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,250
I just don't wanna
get reprimanded

39
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,000
for this down the road.

40
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,708
That won't happen.

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,750
I accept full responsibility.

42
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,416
I went ahead and recorded
all of that, just to be safe.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,875
Now I'll go find the key I need
and get back to you shortly.

44
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,583
We should give
Gino a call. Check in.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,125
So you're absolutely sure?

46
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,875
Shion's tracking
them to determine

47
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,833
if it's Makishima or not.

48
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,916
But either way, there's
no mistaking the fact

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,666
that an armed squad
broke into Nona Tower.

50
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,583
There are clear signs
of forcible entry.

51
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,541
Electronics and communications
are compromised.

52
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,666
And judging from the way they
busted through the entrance,

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,458
the security system here
can't handle the situation.

54
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,666
Understood, Inspector Tsunemori.

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,541
Now, can Kogami
and Kagari hear me?

56
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,916
Yep.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,041
Since the riots have yet
to subside we in Division 1

58
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,541
will deal with the
break-in at the Tower.

59
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:41,833
But listen up.
If Makishima really is there...

60
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,875
Bring down Shogo Makishima,
but don't harm him.

61
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,333
..you arrest him.

62
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,833
We need to interrogate him,

63
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,541
so be sure to capture
him alive, is that clear?

64
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,708
I'll try.

65
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,208
Trying is not
good enough this time!

66
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,333
If he dies it's on your head!

67
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,083
Something wrong?

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,541
No. Don't worry about it.

69
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,958
Are we waiting for Gino
and the others to get here?

70
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,375
You're kidding me, right?

71
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,291
Yeah, I figured.

72
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,125
Hey, hold on.

73
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,291
This building is way too big

74
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,125
for just the three
of us to search alone.

75
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,583
We'll be fine.

76
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,166
Don't forget, we've got an
expert analyst to guide us.

77
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,333
The goddess of
information analysis.

78
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,208
You boys are talking
about me, aren't you?

79
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,458
That depends. Any luck?

80
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,000
I've just tapped into all of
Nona Tower's security cameras

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,000
and I'm controlling
them from here.

82
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,291
The bad guys seem to have
split up into two groups.

83
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,708
Four upstairs, and four down.

84
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,291
Where's Makishima?

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,500
Upstairs. He just stepped off
the elevator on the top floor.

86
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,500
The top floor?
Not the government office?

87
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,291
That's right. They headed
straight for the antenna block.

88
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,958
Maybe they're trying to
hijack the radio signal.

89
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,666
So then their target isn't
the Ministry of Welfare?

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,291
That's odd.

91
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,708
And what's going on with the
group that went downstairs?

92
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,250
I don't know.

93
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,500
I lost them after they went
into basement level four.

94
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,000
It's like they just disappeared.

95
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,625
They may have slipped
through the maintenance hatch

96
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,125
and entered a utility tunnel,
that's my best guess.

97
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,041
Something's
definitely fishy here.

98
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,500
Let's go get him.

99
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,333
What about the others?

100
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,916
I'll take downstairs.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,416
But it'll be one against four.

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,458
So, you guys'll be
two against four.

103
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,541
And with Makishima
there, upstairs is bound

104
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,791
to be a heck of a
lot more dangerous.

105
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,500
All right, good luck.

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,583
Kagari!

107
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,208
Try not to act reckless.

108
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,833
I don't need you of all
people to tell me that, Ko!

109
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,416
Okay, Shion, now how do
we get onto this elevator?

110
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,875
Sorry, but the
elevator's shut down.

111
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,208
and I can't unlock
it from the lab.

112
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,041
Damn!

113
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,166
Should we take the stairs?

114
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,000
There's no time to
climb ninety floors!

115
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,208
But hold on a second. Got it!

116
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,458
The controls for the service
elevators that they use

117
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,458
to transport Drones
run on a separate system.

118
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,750
And they're still online!

119
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,958
They'll take you up!

120
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,750
Can you guide us to them?

121
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,208
Sure thing!

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,250
Make a right at
the hallway ahead.

123
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,333
That's where I lost track

124
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,916
of those guys on
the security cameras.

125
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
So what's up there?

126
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,041
Well, according
to the blueprints,

127
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,458
it's just a dead end.

128
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,791
It might be a trap.
Be careful.

129
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,958
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,583
What's that?

131
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,000
Shion, the basement
is only supposed

132
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,000
to go down four floors,
isn't that right?

133
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,708
Yeah, according
to the schematics.

134
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,375
I got a bad feeling here.

135
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:42,500
This kinda thing is really
not for me. Man I hate this.

136
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,000
Shinya. I shouldn't
have to tell you this,

137
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,583
but don't even think about using

138
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,541
the electromagnetic pulse
grenades near the antenna tower.

139
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,041
Gino would kill me if I did.

140
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,541
So, how do you plan to deal

141
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,083
with those helmets the
bad guys are wearing?

142
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,083
If Akane accompanies you,
your Dominators are useless.

143
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,125
Maybe not.

144
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,916
I picked up one
of their helmets.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,541
We know these things replace
your own Crime Coefficient

146
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,875
with the readings
from somebody nearby.

147
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,291
So, if Inspector Tsunemori puts
this on they shouldn't be able

148
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,791
to copy her Psycho-Pass
to their helmets.

149
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,000
Very clever.

150
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,208
All right, so.

151
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,250
What is Makishima
after up there?

152
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,875
Makishima's a decoy. The real
target's in the basement.

153
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,416
If that weren't the
case it'd make no sense

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
for them to divide
off into two groups.

155
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,000
Shion. There's a
secret department

156
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,375
with no security
cameras down there?

157
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,833
Yeah, and there's bad news.

158
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,166
I seem to have lost
communication with Kagari.

159
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,833
So I've got no clue
what's going on with him.

160
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,916
Makishima wouldn't
just go in blind.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,833
He must have some idea
of what that facility is.

162
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,291
Then why are we going up?

163
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,833
Our mission isn't to stop him
from achieving his goal.

164
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,875
It's to drive him into a corner
and capture him. Right?

165
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,375
Hey, Shion, this place is
really starting to freak me out.

166
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,041
I wanna go back.

167
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,541
Shion?

168
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,875
Communication error.

169
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,375
System link cannot be
established at this time.

170
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,166
You gotta be kidding me!

171
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,833
Son of a bitch!

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,041
How's it going there?
Did you kill him?

173
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
Sorry, but I turned
the tables on your friend.

174
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:16,583
Well, well. Not bad. You're
an MWPSB Enforcer, right?

175
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,625
And who might you be?

176
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,291
Why don't you and
I have a little chat?

177
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,208
This basement is one
giant anechoic chamber.

178
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,875
Which means only
people within it like us

179
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,208
are able to communicate
with one another.

180
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,000
You can't use your
Dominator, can you?

181
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,375
Even if an Inspector were there
now, they couldn't shoot you.

182
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,541
It doesn't matter
what you say or do here,

183
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,625
there will be no repercussions.

184
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,375
So, how's it feel to finally
have your freedom again?

185
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,333
I might enjoy it more
if I wasn't trapped

186
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,666
in some cramped
underground vault.

187
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,250
Soon we can have
the same freedom

188
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,375
in the outside world, as well.

189
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,125
If we destroy the
Sibyl System, this society

190
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,000
will be knocked off
its very foundation.

191
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh come on, you can't
be serious with this crap.

192
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,500
This is no joke.

193
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,708
Waiting for us just behind
the door I'm facing right now

194
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,458
is the core of the Sibyl System.

195
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,916
What?

196
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,833
You and I are the same.
We're both latent criminals.

197
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm like a rat I survive by
sneaking around and hiding.

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,291
While you're a
disposable hunting dog

199
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,333
with a collar slapped on.

200
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,916
So tell me what
you really think.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,041
How does it make you
feel to see those people

202
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,541
who took everything
away from us.

203
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,583
Those people who
treated us like scum,

204
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,833
killing each
other all over town?

205
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,916
Don't you think
it serves them right?

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,416
Oh yeah. Definitely!
A hundred percent!

207
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,458
To be completely honest,
I liked it.

208
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,083
No matter where
I've gone or what I've done,

209
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,833
they've always treated me
like an animal, a monster.

210
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,875
But now, rather than me,

211
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,583
it's them who have become the
savage, bloodthirsty beasts.

212
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,291
I wonder what goes
through their heads

213
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,250
as their friends'
blood splatters on them.

214
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,041
Ah.

215
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,125
Woah, don't get me wrong,
you slimy bastard!

216
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,541
I mean, yeah, Sibyl may be
crap, but so are you guys.

217
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,541
Where do you get off anyway,
manipulating people

218
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,416
and talking about
letting them live or die?

219
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,666
If Sibyl is God here,

220
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,875
then does that mean you
think you're the Devil?

221
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,958
Don't make me laugh.

222
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,041
You know, you and
I are both just trash,

223
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,958
jealous of other
people's happiness.

224
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,541
It makes no difference to me if
thousands die in this damn city.

225
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,666
But what I don't like is the
idea that only the bastards

226
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,041
who are making them kill each
other get to live carefree.

227
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,500
You know what, you creeps
should be the first to die!

228
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,875
You should die over and over,

229
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
once for each
person you've killed!

230
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,666
If I'm not mistaken,

231
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,458
you've killed quite a
few latent criminals yourself.

232
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,833
So, Enforcer, exactly how many
times should you have to die?

233
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,916
I'm not sure what I deserve,
but if there really is a hell,

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
then when I do die,

235
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,041
I bet God will be happy to let
me know when I meet him.

236
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,083
I was thinking we could
become friends, the two of us.

237
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,083
Sorry, but my friends
are upstairs right now,

238
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,541
kicking your boss' ass.

239
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,833
And I'm not about
to betray them for you.

240
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:08,083
What I am about to do is
come and take you down.

241
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
But, you know, if you
have enough time,

242
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,333
it'd be great if you
could destroy Sibyl

243
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,875
before I got there.

244
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,333
Then two of the things I hate
the most will be snuffed out

245
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
from this world
at the same time.

246
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,291
I'll see what I can do.

247
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,166
Although the security
on this last door's

248
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,041
proving tough to crack.

249
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,750
Makishima's on the top floor,
towards the very back.

250
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,500
Near the emergency stairs.

251
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,458
There are no cameras there,
so that's all I can tell you.

252
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,500
That should be more
than enough to go on.

253
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,375
Crime Coefficient
is twenty-four.

254
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,208
Enforcement action not required.
The trigger is now locked.

255
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:16,958
You hurt?

256
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,208
I'm okay.

257
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:22,541
But why'd the Dominator fail.?

258
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,750
How stupid of me.
Makishima's nearby.

259
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,458
Of course his Psycho-Pass is
being copied to their helmets.

260
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,791
So I was wearing that
clunky helmet for no reason?

261
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,041
I'll catch up when
the bleeding stops.

262
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,541
You should keep moving.

263
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,541
Yeah, but you're hurt.

264
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,958
Don't let Makishima
get away! That's an order!

265
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,500
Shit!

266
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,083
You fought rather well
considering your wounds.

267
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,000
You are Shinya Kogami.

268
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,791
And you are Shogo Makishima.

269
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,500
Crime Coefficient is zero.

270
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,666
"Justice is subject to dispute.

271
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,250
Might is easily recognized
and is not, disputed ."

272
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,125
"So we cannot
give might to justice,

273
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,875
because might
has gain said justice."

274
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,875
I'm Sorry. "but I have
long since learned,

275
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,625
as a measure of
elementary hygiene,

276
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,583
to be on guard when
anyone quotes Pascal."

277
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,208
I had a feeling you'd say that.

278
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,375
Ortega, right? If you
had quoted Pascal to me.

279
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,166
I would've come back at
you with the same rejoinder.

280
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,875
Us having the same taste in
books doesn't exactly thrill me.

281
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,333
It'd be fun to spend all
night talking with you

282
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,875
but unfortunately, I have
other business to attend to.

283
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,250
Yeah, so do I.

284
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,291
Mostly, killing you
where you stand.

285
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,791
I'm shocked to hear those
words from a detective.

286
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,541
You've got no string-puller.

287
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,958
All those other puppets are
being manipulated by you.

288
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,583
There'll be plenty of time
to investigate the truth

289
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,458
of this case after
I've killed you.

290
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,916
The last time we were face to
face you were lying there dying

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,166
and I could've easily
finished you off.

292
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Don't you feel in debt
to me for letting you live?

293
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,750
You're about to really
regret that decision.

294
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,958
Don't you want to know the
truth about the Sibyl System?

295
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,875
I had hoped this would end in
a less disappointing fashion.

296
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:39,125
However, for a brief
moment I forgot my boredom.

297
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,166
So thanks for that.

298
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,166
Mister Kogami!

299
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Do it now. Kill him.

300
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:53,833
Shogo Makishima.
You are now under arrest.

301
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,166
What in the hell am
I looking at here?

302
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,791
It's the truth the real
form of the Sibyl System!

303
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,291
Best part is, we don't
even have to destroy it.

304
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,416
Just making this public

305
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,958
will lead to the
downfall of our society.

306
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,041
And then the riots
will really begin.

307
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,416
No one will be
able to stop them!

308
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,958
The target's Threat Judgment
has been reappraised.

309
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,583
Enforcement mode:
Lethal Eliminator.

310
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,250
Trigger safety released.

311
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,666
Aim carefully and
eliminate the target.

312
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,541
Chief?

313
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,541
Are you...?

314
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,208
Enforcement mode:
Non-Lethal Paralyzer.

315
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:13,750
