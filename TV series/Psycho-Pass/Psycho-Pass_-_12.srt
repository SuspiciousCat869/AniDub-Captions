Fuck Sibyl!

6
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:16,000
That looks painful. I thought
you took care of your nails.

7
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,125
Look! Isn't this cute?

8
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,333
This off-brand stuff works

9
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,666
just like the kind for
authorized rockers.

10
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,791
See? No difference.

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,541
Sit.

12
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,208
Here.

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,791
Yayoi!

14
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,125
Rise and shine, patients!

15
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,458
It's time to get up,
and start our day with a smile.

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,916
And for all our guests
who are latent criminals

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,583
Keep working to
purify your Hues!

18
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,791
A pure Hue shall set you free!

19
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,666
Rise and shine, patients!

20
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,625
It's time to get up

21
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,458
And start our day with a smile!

22
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,708
And for all our guests
who are latent criminals

23
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,000
Keep working to
purify your Hues!

24
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,500
A pure Hue shall set you free.

25
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,291
Rise and shine, patients.

26
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,166
It's time to get up and
start our day with a smile.

27
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,500
Me an Enforcer for the police?

28
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,750
The Sibyl System determined

29
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,166
that you would have a
high aptitude for it.

30
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,541
You're a latent criminal.

31
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
You won't get this chance again.

32
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,375
Does this mean
that my Psycho-Pass

33
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,458
is never getting back
to a normal Hue?

34
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,041
Utilize your talents
to the fullest,

35
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,916
and guarantee
yourself a stable life,

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,750
by taking the
Occupational Aptitude Test.

37
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,416
Help contribute to our
wonderful civilization.

38
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,375
Thanks to the O-A-T's
implementation,

39
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,666
any free civilian can
enjoy art, nature, and peace.

40
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,541
Loaning Service. Loaning Service

41
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,583
Hey, hold up.

42
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,125
Are you Miss Kunizuka?

43
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,541
The items you requested

44
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,041
to borrow and
purchase have arrived.

45
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,083
Please verify the contents.

46
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,333
Wait a second.

47
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,375
Yes?

48
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,625
It's too light.

49
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,750
Something I ordered
must be missing.

50
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,916
Where are my
Ernie Ball guitar strings?

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,708
That purchase was not approved.

52
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,791
Again?

53
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,833
How often do
I have to request them?

54
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm sorry. Please submit
another request for them.

55
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,041
Come on!

56
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,375
I haven't been able to play
a guitar for over six months!

57
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,583
Look at my hands!
I'm already losing my calluses!

58
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,208
You expect me to play
with soft fingertips!

59
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,375
Your Hue has
changed to dark yellow.

60
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,166
Don't worry. Breathe it in.

61
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,541
Your Hue's been
pretty stable, lately.

62
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,250
Despite this setback, you should
still be able to leave soon.

63
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,208
And when you do,
you'll be playing

64
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,833
that guitar again that
you're always talking about.

65
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,125
It's a critical time
for you. Be patient.

66
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,750
I've leave some
supplements behind.

67
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,791
Loaning service.

68
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,083
You're wasting
your time asking me.

69
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,291
Actually, I'm here
for something else.

70
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,375
These are pictures of
street scanners vandalized

71
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,958
the last few months.

72
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,375
Each incident has
a different culprit,

73
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,291
and none of their
MOs are the same.

74
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,750
So naturally, we didn't
think they were connected

75
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,916
That is until we plotted

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
the culprits' movements
and noticed this:

77
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,333
They'd all come out of
Kitazawa in the Setagaya Ward.

78
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:24,000
Our theory. Some kind
of anti-establishment,

79
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,583
counter-cultural
insurgency's formed there.

80
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,375
We want to eliminate it.

81
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,541
So what.

82
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,375
We'd like you to help us.

83
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,000
A while back you were a musician
in Kitazawa, weren't you?

84
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,416
You played in the band, Amalgam.

85
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,875
Bet you know every
inch of that place.

86
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,083
What is it?

87
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,083
'Kay, I'll try.

88
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,583
Who is that?

89
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,250
Sasayama. He's
getting tired of waiting.

90
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,291
Hold on, where's Kogami?

91
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,833
Still talking to the girl.

92
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,375
Oh. And no smoking in the car.

93
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,916
Okay, okay. Why couldn't
you have stayed behind?

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,708
Sorry, I'm off the
clock the rest of the day.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,958
So our candidate's a former
authorized punk rock guitarist?

96
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,375
Yep.

97
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,916
How does an authorized musician

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,416
end up becoming
a latent criminal?

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Beats me.

100
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,541
I've heard of some cases where
authorized people's Hues change

101
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,166
Most of the time they're artists

102
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,041
who've become
consumed with their work.

103
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,291
Wow.

104
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,958
Things that arouse
strong feelings, like art,

105
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,583
can be a good thing
if they make you happy.

106
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,916
If not, they act
almost like a poison.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,708
That's why going into the
arts requires authorization.

108
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,500
Work on a painting for too long

109
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,166
and the next thing you
know they've locked you up

110
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,625
and thrown away the key. Yikes.

111
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,500
So, you really think this
chick'll come work for us?

112
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,833
I heard she desperately
wants to return to society.

113
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,833
She does? Heh.
Guess she is crazy.

114
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,833
What makes you think
I'll be so good at this job?

115
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
I have to know why.

116
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,333
Are you saying I have
some hidden aptitude for it?

117
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,625
Yes. See, in this line of work,
you need a good nose.

118
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,375
The kind of nose
that sniffs out clues.

119
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,333
The Sibyl System's determined
that you have that nose.

120
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,041
Just what the police
are looking for.

121
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,166
This Sasayama

122
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,333
Hunh?

123
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,666
Is he the one who
was tired of waiting?

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,916
Yeah.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,041
An Enforcer?

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,000
He is.

127
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,458
So you Inspectors do lead

128
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,666
them around like
they're pathetic dogs!

129
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,500
And you just want
another one on your leash

130
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,625
with a good nose,
don't you Inspector?

131
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,291
Well, I refuse.
I'm not doing anything

132
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,166
that'll ever cloud my Hue again,

133
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,375
Is it true, you want out
to play your music again?

134
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,208
That's none of your business.

135
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,500
Well I can tell you
miss your guitar.

136
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,000
You've put in purchase requests

137
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,291
for guitar strings
twenty-three times.

138
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,666
And you continue to
baby your fingernails.

139
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,083
Alright, that's enough! Get out!

140
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,333
And what if she doesn't
want to sign on?

141
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,833
Don't know.

142
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,625
But Kogami's good. Better chance
with him in there than me.

143
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,333
Is that your way

144
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,875
of finally admitting you're
a charmless bastard?

145
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,125
Shut up.

146
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,208
Yayoi!

147
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
What are you doing!

148
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,833
You can't hang with
unauthorized bands!

149
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,166
Your Hue will cloud up!

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,958
What?

151
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,208
I gotta go.

152
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,458
Sorry we didn't get to finish.

153
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,291
Here, you can have it.

154
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,166
Later.

155
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,750
Come with me, we're going home.

156
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,333
Hold on. I wanna
stay and listen.

157
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,208
An unauthorized
band's music is worthless,

158
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,666
you should know that by now!

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,041
The only thing worthless
is letting Sibyl decide

160
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,416
what kind of music to make,
if you want my opinion.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,125
To be blunt, there's
no way to know of,

162
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,708
let alone check out,
every club in Kitazawa.

163
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,625
The area's full of
abandoned buildings

164
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,791
or just dumps with
absentee landlords.

165
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
It all leads to people pretty
much setting up stages

166
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,125
and venues wherever they want.

167
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,916
It's not uncommon to see a show,

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,958
and then a night later find the
place vanished without a trace.

169
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,833
So only those living
in the neighborhood

170
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,000
will know the specific dates

171
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
and venues of the really
underground events?

172
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,541
Yes.

173
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,583
But there are a few,
common venues

174
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,875
that everyone seems
to know and use.

175
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,458
And you can narrow
down this list further

176
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,000
by only looking at the ones
your vandals have visited

177
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,083
If this group exists,
this "anti-social" movement

178
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,666
of vandals and anarchists

179
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,958
Then it's likely they're using
either the Yellow Hood Club,

180
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,875
or the Two-Seven Club as
bases for their operations.

181
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,916
Two-Seven Club checking in!

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,458
Nothing suspicious here so far!

183
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,291
Everything's clear on my end!

184
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,708
This is Yellow Hood checking in!

185
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,000
There's nothing out of
the ordinary here, either.

186
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,416
Roger.

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,666
Except for these girls;
I gotta come here more often!

188
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,458
What is it?

189
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,291
Sounds like he's
having a good time.

190
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,875
He got used to
a new environment.

191
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,666
Stay put long enough and
you'll adapt to anything.

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,458
Your sub-conscious turns
the strangeness you see

193
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,625
into a "new normal" that your
emotions won't rebel against.

194
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,291
That goes for me, the Enforcers,

195
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,625
even Latent Criminals in
the Rehabilitation Facility.

196
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,833
What are you getting at?

197
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,500
Most don't come back

198
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,166
from the Rehabilitation Facility
with a normal state of mind.

199
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,250
Or I should say, no one does.

200
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,500
Some break down
from the confinement.

201
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,000
Some see their Hue get
so clouded they're executed.

202
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,875
But those are the extremes.

203
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,375
Most of the latent criminals
just become "accustomed."

204
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,708
To what?

205
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,250
To a life where things

206
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,208
are always being
taken away from them.

207
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,166
And then that emptiness ends
up swallowing them whole.

208
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,291
Of course, overcoming this
state of mind through will power

209
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,750
might be possible for
someone of your talents.

210
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,500
But there's a quicker,
easier way, too.

211
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,000
What is that?

212
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,375
A Dominator.

213
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,708
The Sibyl System only allows
Inspectors and Enforcers

214
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,750
to carry and use it.

215
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,875
It's the power
behind the takers.

216
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,041
"The power behind the takers."

217
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,208
If you wanna stop things
being taken from you

218
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,666
Then join the people
who do the taking.

219
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,375
The Dominator you hold
is what makes it possible.

220
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,166
Kunizuka. Your ID is
registered to that gun.

221
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,666
What? Why would you do that?

222
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,708
You never know what might
happen when you're on duty.

223
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,916
Always carry it.

224
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,500
I got eyes on possible perps.

225
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,375
They've been standing by the bar
a while, holding a brown bag.

226
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,666
I bet they're here
dropping something off.

227
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,583
Total amateurs. Piece-a-cake.

228
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,875
Don't be reckless.

229
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,416
That's Rina singing!

230
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,083
♪ Better learn to cast
my doubt away ♪

231
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,000
♪ The truth I could
not handle ♪

232
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,875
♪ My true self
being so fragile ♪

233
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,833
♪ But laughing doesn't
hide all of the pain ♪

234
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,291
Excuse me, fellas.

235
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,791
Yeah, what?

236
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,250
Mind if I take a look?

237
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,500
What the hell!

238
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,916
Bingo. You guys gotta
bomb in here Dontcha?

239
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,291
I'm an Enforcer.

240
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,916
Crime Coefficient:
over one hundred fifty.

241
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,375
It's the cops!

242
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,708
I told him not to
get reckless! Dammit!

243
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,416
Where's the fire extinguisher!

244
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,750
Emergency! Order all
drones to Club Two-Seven!

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,708
This is Ginoza. I'm an
Inspector with the MWPSB

246
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,375
I'm requesting a fire
department dispatch.

247
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,166
Listen up, folks: just
stay put. I have questions!

248
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,250
Kunizuka.

249
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,458
I'm positive that
was Rina's voice!

250
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,541
Don't move!

251
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,000
Or I slice her up!

252
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,875
Hostage Crime Coefficient:
Ninety-Eight.

253
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,750
Enforcement action not required.

254
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,583
The trigger is now locked.

255
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,750
Is she okay?

256
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,250
You guys gonna shoot
me or not? Come on!

257
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,166
You're nothing but a
fascist servant of Sibyl,

258
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,166
killing whoever
she tells you to!

259
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,416
Well, you are fired up.

260
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,833
He's using her to lock your gun.

261
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,791
Yeah, but she's
reading a ninety-eight.

262
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,500
That's practically
a latent criminal.

263
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,583
How bout we round up
and waste them both.

264
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,000
You can't go around
shooting everyone.

265
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,416
You're a nice guy, Ko.

266
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,958
Sure hope it doesn't end
up killing you one day.

267
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,500
What's going on in there!

268
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,541
Some guy threw a bomb!
It's chaos!

269
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,000
Do you know what happened
to Rina, from Prophecy?

270
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,958
The girl who was
just on stage singing?

271
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,625
She was up there right
when the explosion went off.

272
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,375
You're in our way!

273
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,958
You call this a
world where people

274
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,541
can enjoy nature and the arts ?

275
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,208
Sibyl won't even
let me play my music!

276
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,750
How lucky for you!

277
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,958
Ya won't waste your life!

278
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,333
Pursuing some stupid dream.

279
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,958
When you got no real talent!

280
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:06,708
Easy.

281
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,541
Shut up!

282
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,708
Rina!

283
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,916
Yayoi!

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,291
Are you okay?

285
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,916
Yeah, it went off
pretty far from the stage,

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,541
so I'm-- Hey wait what
are you doing back in town?

287
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,250
Did you get outta rehab?

288
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,125
It's kinda hard to explain.

289
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,875
I'm here with the MWPSB.

290
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,208
The cops?

291
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,208
Yo, Rina!

292
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,875
Thanks for waiting.

293
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,708
This is all we managed to save.

294
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,750
That's okay.

295
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,666
You tried. How many are left?

296
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,500
Are those...?

297
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,750
Rina, who is this chick?

298
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,333
No one. Go on ahead.

299
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,125
What's going on?

300
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,250
I said go. I'll catch up.

301
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,666
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,541
Rina. What is all this?

303
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,958
Drop your guns. Or she dies!

304
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,750
Crime Coefficient:
Three Hundred Fourteen.

305
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,000
You're gonna make a mess.

306
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,833
As you can probably tell,
we are attacking Sibyl.

307
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,333
We're rebelling.

308
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,625
If you do that, you become
worse than a latent criminal.

309
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
If you're captured,
they'll execute you.

310
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,041
Well then, you're a different
person than I thought you were.

311
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,041
Yayoi

312
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,000
You should join with us.

313
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,541
Rina, I can't do it.

314
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,916
Why not?

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,791
Because you're
an Authorized Artist?

316
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,333
No that's not it.

317
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,625
But you've seen how
messed up this world is.

318
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,875
You can't deny it.

319
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,916
They call this a democracy,

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but the people
who win our elections

321
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,541
are nothing but
impotent figureheads.

322
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,416
This isn't a free country,
Yayoi, it's a farce!

323
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,583
The people who rule over
us are all chosen by Sibyl!

324
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,791
Every day people become slaves,
giving their lives to a program.

325
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,125
And they're all too
brainwashed to even notice.

326
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:43,166
But our music!
With that, we have power!

327
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,458
We can change people's
hearts and minds!

328
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,250
We'll turn the slaves of
Sibyl into free men and women!

329
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:53,166
And when enough people hear our
music the world will be reborn!

330
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,291
That's wrong.
It's not what I wanted.

331
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,333
Yayoi

332
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,041
The whole time I was away,

333
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,500
the only thing
that kept me going

334
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,666
was dreaming about
playing music again.

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,166
Just rocking out and being
on stage right next to you!

336
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
You should have dreamed bigger!

337
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,750
When you left I finally realized
how empty my life had become.

338
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,000
How little power I had.

339
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,041
Your way won't change
anything. Do you hear me?

340
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:21,083
It's totally pointless
without power!

341
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,000
It's pointless?

342
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,375
That's right!

343
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,458
We need a powerful movement
behind our music, Yayoi!

344
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,625
Rina. We used to have
such a good thing going.

345
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,458
But then it all
had to change, huh?

346
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,083
Is that...?

347
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,333
A Dominator. It's Sibyl's eyes.

348
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,125
You're really choosing
to side with them?

349
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,500
Don't do this, Rina.

350
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,833
Come with me It's not
too late, there's still time.

351
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,166
If you stay on this
path to a rebellion,

352
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,333
all you're doing is helping
sign your own death certificate.

353
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,958
Please, Rina, come with me.

354
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,041
Undergo a rehab program.

355
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,208
Or you shoot me? Is that it?

356
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,083
Yeah, if that's the only option
I have left for stopping you.

357
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,333
You don't have it in you.

358
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,875
No, Rina! Stop! I'll do it!

359
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,125
I'll shoot you, I swear!

360
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,708
Invalid user, Gun deactivated.

361
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,125
What the hell? Come on!
Shoot, damn it!

362
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,625
Rina, come back!

363
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,458
Wait.

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,791
Hey!

365
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,333
Alright. Well,
I'm glad it worked out.

366
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,000
You know, I almost
had a heart attack.

367
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,416
I can't believe
you gave a Dominator

368
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,208
to a latent criminal who's
not an official Enforcer!

369
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,750
That's gotta be a first.

370
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,250
Hey. Are you still there?

371
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,541
Sorry about that.

372
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,750
I thought it'd be a
necessary experience for her.

373
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,291
But the fact she was willing

374
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,500
to shoot means
Sibyl made the right call.

375
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,791
I gotta run. Later.

376
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:40,041
I'll do it.
I'll become an Enforcer.

377
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,583
What?

378
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,333
I'm in. I choose your side.
