1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,666
What is it?

2
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,291
Yeah, haven't heard anything
from her since that email.

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,250
Kaori says she hasn't been able

4
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,291
to reach her since
yesterday, either.

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,750
Oh yes of course I'll
let you know right away

6
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,666
if anything comes up. Take care.

7
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,166
So she's not back at
her parents' place then?

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,208
Yeah, that was a dead-end.

9
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,583
Could she be playing a prank?

10
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,125
No, I mean, Yuki may
tease me from time to time,

11
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,125
but I don't think that she'd
ever take anything this far.

12
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,291
Guess goin' to that location

13
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,791
and scoping things
out is our best move.

14
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,125
Sorry to drag you into
this on your day off.

15
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,458
It's okay.

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,833
Did I cross a line mixing
business with personal?

17
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,750
Eh, it'll be fine as long
as Gino doesn't find out.

18
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,708
This friend of yours,

19
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,916
she usually hang out
in places like this?

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,625
Not at all.

21
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,500
This is getting pretty strange.

22
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,958
It's most definitely strange.

23
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,625
I have no doubt this is a trap.
You're being targeted.

24
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,250
Wait, I am? By who?

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,583
Can you think of any
enemies you've made?

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,333
No way, I never make enemies!

27
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,208
Look, you do realize you're
a detective now, right?

28
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,791
Oh, great, thanks! Now you're
gonna give me that, too?

29
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,458
In any case I'll go in
check it out. You wait here.

30
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,250
But if this is a trap,
you'll be in danger.

31
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
That's why you stay out.

32
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,000
If we both got snagged in there,

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,541
no one would know
we're in trouble.

34
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,583
Should we call for
backup now, just in case?

35
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,916
If you feel that's necessary.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,875
But first, I need
permission to carry.

37
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,291
Sure.

38
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,750
This is Akane Tsunemori,
requesting permission

39
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,791
for an Enforcer to carry arms.

40
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,041
Voiceprint and ID confirmed.

41
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,458
Level Two equipment use granted.

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,916
I'll leave the
navigation to you.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,875
You've got the
location map, right?

44
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,333
Yeah. The data's a little old,
but should still work.

45
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,291
Do you see anything?

46
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,875
Nope.

47
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,166
In the back there...

48
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,000
Say again...

49
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,375
In the back there,
it's a dead end.

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Mister Kogami. Mister Kogami?

51
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,208
Wait a minute! What is that?
What's going on here?

52
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,916
Inspector?
What's wrong? Come in.

53
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,125
I can hear you just fine.
Keep moving forward.

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,833
What the hell is this?

55
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,291
It's an abandoned subway line.

56
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:28,375
You should check the train cars.

57
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:33,458
You should check the train cars.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,708
Mister Kogami! Can you hear me?

59
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,375
Oh no! Please, come in!

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,333
Inspector! What's happening?

61
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,875
It's an abandoned subway line.

62
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,000
You should check the train cars.

63
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,916
It's okay. I'm MWPSB.

64
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,333
And you are ?

65
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,250
I'm Yuki Funahara.

66
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,041
You're Akane Tsunemori's friend.

67
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,666
Uh, yeah, how did you know that?

68
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
I work with her.

69
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,583
Not good.

70
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,625
Looks like the whole
bottom level's been flooded

71
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,083
and from the smell, I'd say
that's contaminated water mixed

72
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,708
with liquid waste.

73
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,000
Something like that gets dumped
on you, you're in for a bad day.

74
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,208
Yeah, but I was
tracking Mister Kogami

75
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,375
and he's already
moved beyond that point.

76
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,916
Actually, he went
back even farther,

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
going straight
through a wall.

78
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,083
Sounds like the
navigator went screwy.

79
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,041
It might be a software
issue, not the hardware.

80
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,708
Since this area's
been redeveloped

81
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,166
so many times
there's no real way

82
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,416
of knowing if the data we have
matches current conditions.

83
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,291
If anyone was deceived
here, wasn't it really you?

84
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,875
And you alone, Inspector?

85
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,791
Kogami managed to
escape your surveillance

86
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,958
and his location is now unknown.

87
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,166
Don't you think... it's possible

88
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,666
he might've staged
this from the start?

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,416
All so that he could
make a break for it?

90
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,000
Uh, Missy?

91
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,791
Suppose we trust the navigator

92
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,250
instead of this
expired map data.

93
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,625
Do you at least know

94
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,375
which direction
Kogami was headed in?

95
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,625
Or did his signal show any
kind of strange movements?

96
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,208
Well yeah now that you mention
it all of a sudden, his signal,

97
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,583
it started moving rapidly
in a straight line That's it!

98
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,708
He must've gotten in a vehicle

99
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,291
Isn't there a subway line
somewhere around here?

100
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,916
One that runs north-south?

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,708
Wait, let me check.
Yeah, there is.

102
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,250
It was called the Ginza Line,

103
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,708
but it was discontinued
sixty years ago.

104
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,375
I'm guessing it wasn't you

105
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,416
who sent Akane
that email was it?

106
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,541
What email?
What's going on here?

107
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,291
And what the hell am
I doing on an old subway car?

108
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,208
It appears that someone
must have abducted you

109
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,083
and brought you down here.

110
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,625
So you don't remember anything?

111
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't know I got home
after working overtime.

112
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:21,458
I took a warm bath and
went straight to bed.

113
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,125
And when I woke up,

114
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:27,166
I was where you found me.
Who would do this?

115
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,333
I think you were used as bait

116
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,541
to lure Inspector
Tsunemori to this place.

117
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,458
Wait, no, it's an
abandoned subway line.

118
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,500
You should check the train cars.

119
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,708
Hey, is that Akane?

120
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,541
It's a fake, assembled
from voice samples.

121
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,541
Well-made, but definitely fake.

122
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,875
They must've known
that she wouldn't be

123
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,875
the one to come down
here to investigate.

124
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,958
They were counting on
someone else doing it instead.

125
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,833
So then their target
was never Tsunemori.

126
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,666
Does that mean they're after me?

127
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,291
Did we just stop?

128
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,666
I guess that means
they want us to get off.

129
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,125
Where are we?

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,666
They're jamming the signal.

131
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,166
Seems like they're
trying to isolate us

132
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,916
from the rest of the world.

133
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,375
Now they want us
to go through there?

134
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,125
I hate having to do
what they tell us to, but

135
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,791
At this point I don't
see other options.

136
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,166
Follow me!

137
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,666
The hell is this?

138
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,208
So far it's all
going as planned.

139
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,833
And these two
seem especially quick

140
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,916
to pick up on things,
don't they?

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The smarter the prey,
the more enjoyable the hunt.

142
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,375
That's excellent.
Looks like this game

143
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,125
will be one worth watching
from the bleacher seats.

144
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,791
Then perhaps you might
like to take part

145
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,583
in the hunt for a change.

146
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,208
Oh, but I have a
vested interest in

147
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,291
what transpires during
this particular excursion.

148
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,750
So it'd be best if I merely
observed as a third party.

149
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,625
What are those?

150
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,375
Chemical lights.

151
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,416
But wouldn't a normal
flashlight work better?

152
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,583
If you're holding
onto a light source,

153
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,666
you'll be an easy
target in the dark.

154
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,416
Besides, these serve as a sign
we've been down this path.

155
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,291
Is Akane's job
dangerous like this?

156
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,750
Yeah it's gotten
really bad lately.

157
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,250
I guess all this time
I should've tried

158
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,291
to take her concerns
more seriously.

159
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,041
She's MWPSB.

160
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,208
She can't discuss details
of her job with civilians.

161
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,166
Is she doing okay at work?

162
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,875
She has faith.
I'll definitely say that.

163
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,875
She has an intuitive
understanding of what it means

164
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,208
to be a detective and
if there's one thing this world

165
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,958
desperately needs more
of it's people like her.

166
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,458
She was always special,

167
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,125
even when we were
in school together.

168
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,500
No matter how
bad the problem was,

169
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,208
as soon as she'd intervene,
it would get resolved.

170
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,333
I wonder about the other people

171
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,250
with the clearest
Psycho-Pass Hues

172
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you think they're amazing
as friends like she is?

173
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,083
Wait a minute.

174
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,375
Are you the bad boy subordinate

175
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,375
Akane says always
leaves her at a total loss?

176
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,041
So that's how she talks about
me when I'm not around?

177
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,875
Interesting.

178
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,000
What? What's the matter?

179
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,875
A trap.

180
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,833
Even their traps
are old fashioned.

181
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,416
They've sure got
interesting taste.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,375
Look at that.

183
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,500
A little to the right from
the floor you just checked.

184
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,916
The same bag we saw earlier!

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,333
Hold it!

186
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,208
I think I just saw someone!

187
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,916
Yeah. Now I know
what's going on.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,208
We've been lured
into a foxhunt here.

189
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,333
A foxhunt?

190
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,333
Those Drones act
like hunting dogs.

191
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,666
When the prey gets
scared and runs,

192
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,666
then the hunter takes his shot.

193
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,208
Unfortunately,
we're the foxes here.

194
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,500
That's awful.

195
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,875
Don't panic. Don't get scared.

196
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,500
Just remain calm
and look for a way out.

197
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,666
If we freak out, we
play into their hands.

198
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,333
Where's that bag?

199
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,666
Uh, here

200
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
What's that?

201
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,833
Portable transponder.

202
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,958
We can communicate with this

203
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,000
even if they're
jamming the signal.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,041
You mean we can
call for help now?

205
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, we could

206
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,416
If it wasn't missing the
battery and the antenna.

207
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,416
I'm gonna go create
a distraction.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,833
You just keep your
head down and wait here.

209
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,333
What are you gonna do?

210
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,750
We don't stand a chance
against two foxhounds.

211
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,625
Unless I take at least one
down, they'll surround us

212
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,083
and then we'll
really be done for.

213
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,583
Mister Kogami!

214
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,041
Let's go!

215
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,041
I got one of 'em.

216
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:45,041
And now all
I need's the antenna.

217
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,833
He's a cunning one.

218
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,958
He may be just a fox, but
that still makes him a canine.

219
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,041
Or perhaps a member
of the wolf family.

220
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,125
Mister Makishima,
I'm starting to suspect

221
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
you've introduced some
additional plot twists

222
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,833
into this game,
unbeknownst to me.

223
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,708
Am I correct in thinking this?

224
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,791
When a man is confronted with
fear his very soul is tested.

225
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,541
Everything that
he was born to seek,

226
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,541
everything that he
was born to achieve,

227
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,625
his true nature will be
revealed quite clearly.

228
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,916
Was that intended to mock me?

229
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,250
It's not just this
Kogami I have my eyes on.

230
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,708
I'm interested in you
as well, Mister Senguji.

231
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,625
An unforeseen situation,
an unexpected turn of events.

232
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,291
In the wake of such moments,

233
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,416
you too will be forced
to face your true self.

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,833
I know that that is the thrill

235
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,791
and experience you've
really been chasing here.

236
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:45,041
Indeed. You know, I have
to say I don't really mind

237
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,583
this habit of yours of
observing others from on high.

238
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,500
And now Shinya Kogami

239
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,833
let's see if you will come

240
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,458
to understand the true
meaning of this game.

241
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:05,958
I can't run anymore.
I can't! I just can't!

242
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,125
Hey! Are you listening?

243
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,625
Sorry. I was lost in thought.

244
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,666
Well, please, just say
something, anything.

245
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,875
When you're quiet you can be
a little creepy, you know that?

246
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,291
I was thinking...

247
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,625
With you as bait, they
knew they'd lure in Akane

248
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,250
but they counted
on her enlisting me

249
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,666
to come look for
you in her place.

250
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,083
They had it all worked
out when they set this up.

251
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,541
So it's really you they wanted

252
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,833
to play this game
with all along, isn't it?

253
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,833
ha Which means
that I'm just, damn it!

254
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,916
I'm just some stupid
pawn in all this?

255
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,875
I think that's right.

256
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,291
But once that email was sent

257
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,958
from your account last
night to bring us here,

258
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,666
you'd no longer be
necessary to them.

259
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,916
So then why did they
bring you down here

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,875
and put you on that subway car?

261
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,500
I think I know.

262
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,125
Doesn't my being here
make it much more difficult

263
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,125
for you to run away from them?

264
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,875
In fact, I'm the only
thing holding you back,

265
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,166
even as we speak.

266
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,291
If I wasn't here, you'd
be making a clean break

267
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,666
for it right now, wouldn't you?

268
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,250
It's fine. Just do
what you have to do.

269
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,541
This sucks.

270
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,916
The fox hunt...

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,250
it isn't just a
one-sided game now.

272
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,666
With this, I think
they're hinting

273
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,000
that I've got a
chance to win, too.

274
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,041
In other words,
I'm being tested.

275
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,041
And whether or
not I abandon you

276
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,416
I bet that decision
is one of the keys

277
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,208
to winning this game.

278
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,958
Hey, take off your clothes.

279
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,875
What, right here,
in the middle of all this?

280
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you out of your damn mind?

281
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,416
Just give 'em to me.

282
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,750
This is insane!

283
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
I think you've got a
screw loose or something!

284
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,291
If you wanna make it out
of here alive, then strip!

285
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,166
Can't believe the MWPSB
hires pervs like you!

286
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,666
What? What are you looking at?

287
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,958
Wouldn't you normally
match your underwear?

288
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,291
That's weird. But why would...?

289
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll need those, too.

290
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,083
You can at least
look the other way.

291
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,791
And there we have it.

292
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,083
The last item we
needed to beat the game

293
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,625
was hidden right there on you.

294
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,791
It's the transponder's
missing antenna.

295
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,958
I'm seeing some
pretty heavy jamming

296
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,083
throughout this area right here
though the range is limited.

297
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,541
Where's the source
of the jamming?

298
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,416
It's coming from the southwest.

299
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,791
But looking at the map,

300
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,250
there shouldn't be anything
in that whole section.

301
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,583
All right.

302
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,916
Let's go ahead and set up
a relay base right here.

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,333
Don't trust the map data.

304
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,750
Check every single gap
and corner thoroughly.

305
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,500
Also as soon as you see Kogami,
shoot him with the Dominator.

306
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,250
There's no need to warn him.

307
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,375
But we still don't know

308
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,583
if he was actually
trying to run away.

309
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,458
The Sibyl System will make
that determination for us.

310
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,375
If he did nothing wrong
then his Crime Coefficient

311
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,083
will be the same as the
last time you shot him.

312
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,666
And the Paralyzer
mode will knock him out

313
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,625
But if he really
wanted to fly the coop

314
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,875
then it'll mercilessly go into
Eliminator mode and that's it.

315
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,500
Yes, well, the cymatic
scan is never wrong.

316
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,666
It will reveal
Kogami's true intentions.

317
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,416
Are you really saying you'd
be okay with killing him?

318
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,416
You used to be his
friend, didn't you?

319
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,541
If he does end up dying,
Inspector Tsunemori,

320
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,416
it'll be due to
your poor supervision.

321
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
If you had any
control over Kogami,

322
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,333
then we wouldn't
be in this position

323
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,208
of having to potentially
kill the man.

324
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,166
Tell me: How does
it feel knowing

325
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,208
someone could die because
of your incompetence?

326
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,916
All right, Inspector.

327
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,291
That's enough, don't you think?

328
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,291
You're bein' a little
hard on the girl?

329
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,375
It's from Kogami!

330
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,041
Run a trace on my location.

331
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,916
We have a Code 108 in progress.

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,541
Requesting immediate backup.

333
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,291
I repeat: We have a
Code 108 in progress.

334
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,250
Send in the drones!

335
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,500
We don't know the right path.

336
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
Just pick them at random!

337
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,625
And make sure at least one
of those drones reaches him!

338
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,041
Hold on Kogami. We're coming!
