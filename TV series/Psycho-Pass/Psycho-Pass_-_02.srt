1
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,083
Good mornnninnnngggg!

2
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,000
The time is now 08:15
on November fifth.

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,166
Akane Tsunemori's Psycho-Pass
Hue this morning is powder blue!

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,958
You're bound to
have a wonderful day

5
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,375
with that top-notch
healthy mind of yours!

6
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,041
Ohhhh, I messed up.

7
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,833
Am I on the day shift today?
Please tell me I'm not.

8
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,791
You're having lunch
with Yuki Funahara

9
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,416
and Kaori Minase at
Akebonobashi Station at 11:00.

10
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,916
Your second day of official duty

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,250
with the Public Safety Bureau
starts promptly at 14:30.

12
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,833
Ahhh, that's right.

13
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,458
What's your desired
room preference for today?

14
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,125
I guess Victor Horta's
Hotel Tassel.

15
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,458
Great! I'll pull the
design from the library!

16
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,250
Your dietary intake yesterday

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,041
was a total of twenty-two
hundred calories.

18
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,916
The proper amount
for today's breakfast

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,500
is a total of 240 calories.

20
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,333
Let's just go with 200.

21
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,416
And make it Chinese style.

22
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,750
Sure thing, coming right up!

23
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,833
It was my first day on the job.

24
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,791
Why'd I have to? It's not fair.

25
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,875
Today's weather is cloudy
followed by sunny skies.

26
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,125
Even better, there's a
zero percent chance of rain!

27
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,541
The projected group stress

28
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,125
in the Shinjuku Ward
is level three.

29
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,833
A supplement is recommended to
prevent mental contamination.

30
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,208
Yeah, I guess
this'll have to do.

31
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,041
See ya later.

32
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,583
You have a wonderful dayyyy!

33
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,125
Sooo. Ya messed things
up on the first day, huh?

34
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,583
Yeah, but I can't really
tell you guys about it.

35
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,125
It's classified to
bureau personnel only.

36
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,958
I'm kind of
clueless on this stuff.

37
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,250
But you didn't do anything

38
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,875
that violated the
standard protocol did you?

39
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I guess not.

40
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,333
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

41
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,291
Besides your Psycho-Pass
isn't exactly cloudy.

42
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,291
Could it be that maybe you're
not that upset about it?

43
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,875
Come on, don't mess with me.

44
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,250
I couldn't even get a full
hour of sleep last night.

45
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,166
And look at your Psycho-Pass.

46
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,708
Your Hue Check
gives a clear color

47
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,125
even when
you're distressed.

48
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,583
It's amazing.

49
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,208
You really don't give yourself
much psychological care.

50
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,083
But you're the paragon
of mental health.

51
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,833
I don't get it. How are
you able to stay so healthy?

52
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,291
I have no idea.
Maybe I'm just thick skinned?

53
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,958
Life is so totally
cruel and unfair.

54
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,666
No kidding.

55
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,458
Well. In any case.

56
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,083
It's not like I'm doubting
the Sibyl System or anything.

57
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,666
But a career with the PSB,
maybe I'm just not right for it.

58
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,000
I'd kill to have that problem.

59
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,166
I know you're ditzy, but
I can't believe you said that.

60
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,375
Let's talk about your
aptitude for starters.

61
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,375
All of your tests showed
that you were a perfect fit

62
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,666
for the Ministry of
Economy or Technology,

63
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,083
but you opted for the
Public Safety Bureau.

64
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,500
I wish I had that many options.
I only got C rankings.

65
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,208
Oh, don't you start complaining,

66
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,375
at least you enjoy
blue-collar work.

67
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,958
What do I get out of
being a Systems Engineer?

68
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,708
Stiff shoulders, that's what.

69
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,708
Come on, Akane.
You were an honor student,

70
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,250
you scored a seven
hundred on your last exam.

71
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,250
And you're telling us
that you can't hack it

72
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,375
as a civil servant?

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,541
Hey, cheer up.
We were only teasing.

74
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,041
Besides, I know for
a fact that no one

75
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,166
could possibly do this
job better than you can.

76
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,083
And that's got nothing to
do with the aptitude tests.

77
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,250
It's 'cuz I know what
you're capable of.

78
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,125
"What needs to be done
is done by those capable.

79
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:55,291
Such is the grace bestowed upon
mankind by the Sibyl System."

80
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,208
Whatever that means.

81
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,041
Excuse me.

82
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,000
But I'm trying to find the
analyst Shion Karanomori.

83
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,416
You found her. Now who are you?

84
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,125
Uh. I've been assigned to the
CID as of just yesterday ma'am.

85
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,958
Inspector Akane Tsunemori.

86
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,250
So you're the newbie
that shot down Shinya

87
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
with the Paralyzer last night.

88
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,833
Well you're a lot cuter
than I expected you to be.

89
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,500
And ballsy. Look at you being
a little cutie with big balls.

90
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,000
So what the hell happened?

91
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,708
Let me guess, Shinya
tried to grab your ass, huh?

92
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,750
No, that's not what--

93
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,291
They told me that you're the one

94
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,666
that you could tell me
how Kogami's doing?

95
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Ah. Of course.

96
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,083
Can you believe the
government's got me

97
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,083
delegating employee health
care out of the Analysis Lab

98
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,125
just 'cuz I've got
a physician's license?

99
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,750
I mean, yeah, sure,
I'm also a latent criminal.

100
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,833
But it's not like that gives
them the right to treat me

101
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,500
like a freakin' slave
while I'm down here.

102
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,333
Uh. Right.

103
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,625
Let's see. Akane.
It's Akane, right?

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,875
You must be on the fast track
if you're already an Inspector.

105
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,416
Do me a favor and
reform the system

106
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,541
once you become a
high-ranking official.

107
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,375
You could start by having
them put in a swimming pool

108
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:16,208
and a bar area in
the CID. Pretty please.

109
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,583
I don't know. Um. How's
Kogami's treatment been?

110
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,875
Oh. Hold on.

111
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,250
I don't know where
you were aiming,

112
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,375
but you managed to land a direct
hit right on his spinal cord.

113
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,958
So he's still got a
little more healing to do.

114
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,041
Not exactly up to
walking and talking yet.

115
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,541
He's not up for having
any fun in bed either.

116
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,458
I suppose it'd be okay
to peek in on him though.

117
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,125
He won't know you're there,
of course. It's up to you.

118
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,750
No that's alright. I don't
wanna risk waking him.

119
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,708
He should be back
to normal tomorrow.

120
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,541
He just needs a
full day of rest.

121
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,208
Check back in the morning
and you can talk to him.

122
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
Okay.

123
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,708
Umm.

124
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,500
Sorry, but... is there
another tablet I can use?

125
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,833
Well, the last I checked,

126
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,583
Enforcer Kogami was using
all the spare equipment.

127
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:53,000
Uh, but how could he,
I mean, Kogami's still.

128
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,041
Recovering from
being shot? Yes, he is.

129
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,875
Jeez, that hurt.

130
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,583
Here.

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,833
You can use mine.

132
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,666
Oh, thanks a lot.

133
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah, I know I'm late.
Sorry. Well hello.

134
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,916
I wasn't aware that you
were on duty tonight.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Uhh. Yeah.

136
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,166
Must be tough on ya comin'
in after last night.

137
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,208
Well, let's just keep our
fingers crossed today's

138
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,666
a little more laid back.

139
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,333
Elevated Area
Stress Level warning.

140
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,333
A Psycho-Pass above
the regulation value has

141
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,583
been detected inside Iko Gryce
Hill in the Adachi Ward.

142
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,916
The on duty Inspector
and available Enforcers

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
are immediately required
for intervention at the scene.

144
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,333
That's what I get for
askin' for a peaceful day.

145
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,416
Aw, man. Too bad our shift
just ended. Have fun!

146
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,083
Do you want some backup?
I'll cover for Kogami.

147
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,833
Thanks, but I'm sure
we'll be okay on our own.

148
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,458
Well, Inspector Akane.
You ready to head out?

149
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,166
We've had drones posted on each

150
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,041
of the mall's exits since
the warning was triggered.

151
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,750
But they haven't managed
to catch anyone yet.

152
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,166
More specifically,

153
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,875
they haven't caught whoever's
raising the area stress.

154
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,916
So they're still
somewhere in the mall.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,291
Will we need to use
the Dominators for this?

156
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,166
We should keep them on us,
just as a precaution.

157
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,166
But I sincerely doubt that
we'll need to un-holster them.

158
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,000
Enough chit-chat. Shall we go?

159
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,333
Are you too uncomfortable?

160
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,750
I thought you'd
be okay with this.

161
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,083
Don't all you kids love
playing with holo-suits?

162
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,500
Yeah, I'm just not used to
my whole body being an avatar.

163
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,416
I'm not giving up.

164
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,041
Stop it cut it out.

165
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,791
I'm not doubting
your persistence!

166
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
Better not.

167
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,166
Come on. Quit
playing hard to get.

168
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,375
Oh. There he is.

169
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,000
The guy hiding behind
the column back there.

170
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,166
Are you sure?

171
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,083
How can you tell
without using a scanner?

172
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,916
It's hard to explain, but a
beast can sniff out his own.

173
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,958
Excuse me, sir.

174
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,375
Would you mind

175
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,583
if we took a quick measure
of your Psycho-Pass?

176
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, buddy. Now that is cloudy.

177
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,250
Without a doubt, you are in
need of some emergency therapy.

178
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,916
I need you to
please come with me.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,333
What? But why?
I haven't done anything wrong.

180
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,583
I'm amazed you can spot
latent criminals like that.

181
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,458
You can tell when
they're up to no good, but...

182
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,833
The best way to catch a
bad guy is to think like one.

183
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,250
Doesn't matter if you're
a good guy, though.

184
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,708
Being able to think
like a criminal

185
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,458
is about the same as
being one to the system.

186
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,791
It all registers the
same and that's

187
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,541
why I've got such a crazy
high Crime Coefficient.

188
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,000
Thanks to my skills
as a peace officer,

189
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,041
I'm now treated as a
glorified hunting dog.

190
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,791
You were great.

191
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,000
But I was just
useless out there.

192
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,083
That's not true,
you were quite helpful.

193
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,583
Enforcers can't even
show themselves in public

194
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,625
without an Inspector
by their side.

195
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,833
But that's nothing.

196
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,791
Don't get me wrong here.

197
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,875
Look, after you bring the
Enforcers to the scene,

198
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,375
they're really only thing you
need to worry about.

199
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,708
Don't let em slack off,
run away or cause trouble.

200
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,250
And that's it easy peasy
that's all there is to your job.

201
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,625
So you're saying
that it's my job

202
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,875
to stand back
and do nothing?

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,083
How 'bout some company,
Inspector? If you don't mind.

204
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,000
Sure.

205
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,666
I thought you were already
off duty for the night.

206
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,166
You do realize that we
Enforcers are prisoners, right?

207
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,250
Creamer.

208
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,583
Even when we're not on the
clock, our access is restricted

209
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,125
to the CID floor and
our own personal quarters.

210
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,250
I'm sorry I acted
like a jerk earlier.

211
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,458
I was just jokin' around but
I got a little carried away.

212
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,000
In case you haven't
noticed, most of the women

213
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,458
who work here can
be scary as all hell.

214
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,500
So I'm actually happy we've got
such a cute girl around now.

215
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,875
Really, I'm glad
you're here, Akane.

216
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
Oh, yeah. You mind
if I call you Akane?

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,916
I don't see why not.

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,333
You've got me curious.
Inspector for the MWPSB.

219
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,791
I mean, talk about a crazy
ass place to wanna work.

220
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,125
Why'd you pick this job?

221
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't think I'm right
for it. Do you?

222
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,625
You're asking that after
what happened yesterday?

223
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,958
I doubt many people
would say you are.

224
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,125
Sibyl's Judgment of
my job aptitude had me

225
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,208
well over the PSB's
employment standards.

226
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,541
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I don't get.

227
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,875
The standards for
the PSB are top tier.

228
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,500
So your rankings
must've qualified you

229
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,250
for other careers too.

230
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,208
I mean, couldn't you have
just picked a different job?

231
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,583
Yeah.

232
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,041
Actually.

233
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,291
I got an A ranking for
all thirteen ministries

234
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,666
and six companies.

235
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,166
What? Seriously?

236
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,833
Yeah, but.

237
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,041
With all the other jobs,

238
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,125
I wasn't the only one
to get an A ranking.

239
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,791
There was at least one other
person that got the same grade.

240
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,583
But I was the only one

241
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,083
who scored an A ranking
for the MWPSB.

242
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,250
There were more than
500 students graded.

243
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,791
So I thought there must be some
job I was meant to do here,

244
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,333
some kind of work
that only I could do.

245
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,208
I thought my life would make
sense if I took a job here.

246
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,083
That I might be
able to understand

247
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,958
what my purpose
in the universe is.

248
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,541
Why are you looking
at me like that?

249
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,708
Do you think I'm wrong?

250
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,625
How the hell should I know?

251
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,416
Why would you
even ask my opinion?

252
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,708
You could've become
anything you wanted.

253
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,416
Chosen any kind of life
there is a person could live.

254
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,416
Probably agonized
over all your options.

255
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,583
It's incredible.

256
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,875
It's like you're one of
those people from

257
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,916
back before Sibyl
was created. Really.

258
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,125
You might not be aware of this,

259
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,916
but most suckers these
days get pegged into

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,083
whatever job the Sibyl System
thinks they're right for.

261
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,375
And yet, here you are with
all the options in the world.

262
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,083
Talking about making
sense of your life

263
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,708
and finding out your
purpose in the universe.

264
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,625
I got flagged in a Psycho-Pass
test when I was five years old.

265
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,958
Labeled as a latent
criminal ever since.

266
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,125
Not even capable
of rehabilitation.

267
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,458
That's why I'm at the MWPSB.

268
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,458
I could become one
of their hunting dog

269
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,000
and assassinate
people for them,

270
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,791
or spend my life in
an isolation facility.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,708
That's the only choice
I got to make about my life.

272
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,166
I was really trying my damnedest

273
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,666
not to be mean to you,
but ya know what?

274
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,041
I changed my mind.

275
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,000
So I'm gonna ask you
this one more time.

276
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,166
Tell me. Why did you decide
to become an Inspector?

277
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
I'm so sorry!

278
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,583
Ya don't see many Inspectors
apologize to Enforcers.

279
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,833
You must be pretty
angry with me.

280
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,500
What you did was
your decision to make.

281
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,791
And it's not my place
to complain about it.

282
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,750
But what I did.
Was it the wrong decision?

283
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,083
Did I just get in
everyone's way?

284
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,166
I screwed things up and
put all of you in danger.

285
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,333
I've been an Enforcer
for a long time now.

286
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,041
I'm a hunting dog.
And I behave like one.

287
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:19,125
Following orders and taking
down prey is ingrained in me.

288
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,958
My hands only know how
to do what they're told.

289
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,208
I've always obeyed
that gun's orders

290
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,125
and I've taken down
many latent criminals.

291
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,125
I did what was best for society,
blindly accepting that idea.

292
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,916
And one day I just stopped
thinking about what I was doing.

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,708
It all became perfunctory to me.

294
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,125
As natural an act as breathing.

295
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,250
I've been such a fool.

296
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,333
I've forgotten what being a
detective is actually about.

297
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,208
It's about protecting
people, not hurting them.

298
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,791
Mr. Kogami.

299
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,208
You were right.

300
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,416
And you were able to make
that decision on your own.

301
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,291
You were able to put
justice before duty.

302
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,500
Working for a boss like you,
I might be able to act

303
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,250
like a real detective instead of
just taking orders like a dog.

304
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,791
Thank you very much!

305
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,041
You don't see too
many Inspectors

306
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,625
thanking their Enforcers either.

307
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If you had had more time

308
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,958
to calmly think
about the situation.

309
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,041
Well, you would've tried

310
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,416
to avoid shooting her,
wouldn't you?

311
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,500
I really don't know.

312
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't hesitate at the time. I
thought I'd die if I hesitated.

313
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,541
I remember thinking
I don't wanna die here.

314
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,583
Not in a place like this.
I refuse to die here.

315
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,458
That one thought
consumed me entirely.

316
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,291
I still have
unfinished business.

317
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,083
I won't let it. Nothing's gonna
stop me until it's settled.

318
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,000
Mr. Kogami?

319
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,833
So. Your official
report states that you

320
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,833
made the right
decision at the time.

321
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,875
And that's your
conclusion, Inspector?

322
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,541
You're certain about this one?

323
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,125
Yes, sir.

324
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,791
The elevated state of her Crime
Coefficient was only temporary.

325
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,041
In fact the therapy
she's received

326
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,750
while in custody is going well

327
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
and her Psycho-Pass
is already recovering.

328
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,666
Kogami do you wanna
make a statement?

329
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,875
Yes. Inspector Tsunemori
fulfilled her duty.

330
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
That's all.
