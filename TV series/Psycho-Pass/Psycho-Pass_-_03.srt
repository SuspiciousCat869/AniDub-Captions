1
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,125
Victim's Daisuke Shioyama.
Age twenty-seven.

2
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,166
He worked at
Hachioji Drone factory.

3
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,416
His co-workers found his
body at four AM this morning.

4
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
They say the drone he was
servicing dismembered him.

5
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,375
Could be just an accident?

6
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,750
That's what I thought at first.

7
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,041
Until I heard it was already
the third worker death

8
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
at the drone factory this year.

9
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,708
That's clearly not right.

10
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,875
The morning shift
found the body here,

11
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,000
in the Drone Behavior
Inspection room.

12
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,666
This area's the only
part of the production line

13
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,458
that uses human labor.

14
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,125
The factory has 50 debuggers on
the line, around the clock.

15
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,583
So those guys live here?

16
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,750
If the company's quota
is a thousand fully tested

17
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,416
drones a month, and they
want low-worker overhead,

18
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,750
keeping them on site in constant
shifts is the only option.

19
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,041
From what I understand,
by installing a sub-routine

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,083
in a drone before
it completes testing,

21
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,291
you can make it malfunction

22
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,541
in a way that looks
like an accident.

23
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,083
This sounds like.

24
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,500
A first-degree murder case.

25
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, if there are
only fifty total workers,

26
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
it seems straightforward:

27
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,916
We just check each one
of their Crime Coefficients.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
At this place, the
normal rules don't apply.

29
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,458
Inspector Ginoza.

30
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,833
Yeah, what?

31
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,916
I think I'm finally getting
the hang of how to work

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,208
with the Enforcers.

33
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,708
Are you talking about working

34
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,125
with the Enforcers as your
"friends and colleagues"?

35
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,666
Or do you mean working over them

36
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,625
as their "handler"
as an Inspector should.

37
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,375
Fools learns from
their experiences.

38
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,958
The wise learn from history.

39
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,541
I hope for all our sakes
you're not a fool, Akane.

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,041
Detectives, thank you
so much for coming.

41
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,166
Can you please show us
where you found him?

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,625
No problem, Inspector.
Follow me.

43
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,625
After the drones
come off the line,

44
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,166
we bring them here for test
runs and safety checks.

45
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,916
In this factory,
machines build machines,

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,541
but for the final checkout,
we believe humans can

47
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,875
and should play a decisive role
in the drone's qualification.

48
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,708
We can't deny that
it's dangerous work.

49
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,708
Have you observed
the pace of the work

50
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,791
having any kind of
strain on your debuggers?

51
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,750
From time to time.

52
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,791
It's very demanding and
doesn't allow much time

53
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,916
for relaxing like
in office jobs.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,125
With no Internet, workers
don't have distractions,

55
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,416
but they also don't
have diversions.

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,791
So, this entire
facility is off-line?

57
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,041
That's correct, Miss.

58
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083
There's not even an
old Ethernet cable here.

59
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,875
Plus, every structure
on the campus is built

60
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,500
as an anechoic chamber.

61
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,416
This means the walls
absorb reflections

62
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,125
of incoming and outgoing
sounds and EM waves.

63
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,541
We may be cut off
from the outside world,

64
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,875
but we're also a hundred
percent secure from hacking.

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,583
This place is creepy.
They're so isolated.

66
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,916
A clean up drone removed

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,833
the body during
the initial response.

68
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,166
Here's a recording of that.

69
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,875
He was alive as the attacking

70
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,416
drone ripped him
apart piece-by-piece.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,750
Nasty.

72
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,000
Did Mr. Shioyama, have
any conflicts or problems

73
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,666
with other workers?

74
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,333
No, he got along with
everyone, and they with him.

75
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,541
And his Psycho-Pass was clean.

76
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,958
It had to have been an accident.

77
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,291
If three dismemberment
deaths are accidents

78
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,291
you should watch more
workplace safety videos.

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,791
Like I said, this
is not easy work.

80
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,041
The debuggers accept the risks.

81
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,833
I appreciate that
you have concerns

82
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,125
about this factory's
safety practices.

83
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,666
But please, relay
them at another time

84
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,333
to the appropriate
plant administrators.

85
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,958
Should we inspect the attacking
drone for any alterations?

86
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
I'm already having it
sent to headquarters.

87
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,750
Karanomori will be
analyzing it for us.

88
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,625
But early word is
not to expect much.

89
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,583
The Drone's memory
cells are destroyed.

90
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,500
For now, I need you
to go back to the car

91
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,875
and upload this recording to HQ

92
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,666
I have to ask Chief Goda
some more questions.

93
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,125
Will do, sir.

94
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
I think this file
should help complete

95
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,583
your investigation, Inspector.

96
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,875
The results of our
own periodic check-ups

97
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,791
as well as Hue
assessments conducted

98
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,708
by building scanners. Here.

99
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,125
Thank you, this helps.

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,958
Go over everything
with a magnifying glass;

101
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,041
you'll still find that no
worker's Psycho-Pass

102
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,916
ever routinely exceeded
his regulated value.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,541
If you're still
suspecting murder,

104
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,458
I don't know which worker
would even be your suspect.

105
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,041
Well, we won't be
able to know for sure

106
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,875
until we run this data through
the Sibyl System for analysis.

107
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,000
Unfortunately,
that takes some time.

108
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,416
Unless, of course,
you're okay with us

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
using something unorthodox
on your workers.

110
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,083
And that would be?

111
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,041
Our Dominators.

112
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,833
If you'll let your workers
assemble outside

113
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,541
the anechoic buildings

114
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,708
we can use the devices
to check them, right now.

115
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,875
But that would mean we'd have
to suspend operations for hours!

116
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,791
Mister Goda, people's
lives are at stake here.

117
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,041
If you can find evidence that
Shio-yama's death is a murder,

118
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,625
we will cooperate fully
with this investigation.

119
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,583
We're not in business
to protect criminals.

120
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,083
But until then, we must assume
this was a tragic accident.

121
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,291
And need I remind
you, to interrupt this plant's

122
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,958
production would
require not only

123
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,250
that evidence but
also a signed order

124
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,416
from the Minister
of Economy himself.

125
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,250
Something I hear
does not come easy.

126
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,916
Ginoza may be a straight
arrow but I bet he really

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,750
turned the screws on
the shifty factory chief.

128
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,583
Guy's a pain in the ass.

129
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,083
Are they always like that?

130
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,208
Didn't you read the file
on this place, Akane?

131
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,375
This is a government factory
under the Ministry of Economy.

132
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,375
Ha, These kinda
places will do just

133
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,833
about anything to
protect their profit margins.

134
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,416
They don't want people like us

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,291
from the outside meddling and
causing a drop in productivity.

136
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,750
Even when some of their
own workers have died?

137
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
That's why they prefer to chalk
this up as another accident

138
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,791
and sweep it under the
rug as soon as possible.

139
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,208
Well, maybe an accident
is all that happened.

140
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,125
Their scanners never detected
anyone dangerous, right?

141
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,666
That's true, but then again.

142
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
Those automated
scanners aren't perfect.

143
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,916
In fact, the best
they can manage

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,250
is a quick Hue Check of
a person's stress levels.

145
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,541
If you really want
to use cymatic scan data

146
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,916
to check a potential suspect's
full mental state, job aptitude,

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,291
Crime Coefficient,
everything, you need to run

148
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,083
a dedicated analysis
through the Sibyl System.

149
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,625
Too bad there's always
a waiting list for it.

150
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,583
Unless our Dominators
find something.

151
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,166
Then, no matter
who's ahead of us,

152
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,125
we can jump to the front of the
line and receive an analysis.

153
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,166
With a Dominator and the
Sibyl System working together,

154
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,500
you can reveal a suspect's
entire mind in a second.

155
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,666
Most of the time.

156
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,625
Here, I'll show ya.

157
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,791
User authentication.

158
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,875
Inspector Akane Tsunemori.

159
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,500
Dominator usage approved.

160
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,083
Communication error.

161
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,666
System link cannot
be established.

162
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,416
To be hack-proof, these
buildings block all radio waves,

163
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,666
so as long as we're in here

164
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,916
we can't connect
to the Sibyl System.

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,333
The Dominators might
as well be scrap iron.

166
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,125
Nothing but fancy-lookin'
paperweights.

167
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:26,458
Still, what if the
death was, well, you know.

168
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,833
All just a terrible mistake? Ha!

169
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,666
I'm sorry; it's hard
not to laugh at that idea.

170
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,041
I'll say!

171
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,208
No offense, but if that
crime scene wasn't clear,

172
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,916
ya ain't much of a detective.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,125
Just seeing pics would give
any Enforcer a gut feeling.

174
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,375
It was a murder, okay?

175
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,125
I wonder what the
perp's motive was?

176
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,000
Based on the thrashing
that poor victim took,

177
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,083
my intuition tells me
some kind of a grudge.

178
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,000
Food's good, but this is
such a sad place to work.

179
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,000
Imagine spending every minute
of your life totally off-line,

180
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,416
in this day and age!

181
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,083
But if it's as bad for
the workers as you say.

182
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,583
Why are their hues so stable?

183
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,125
Hey, don't underestimate
people's ability

184
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,208
to entertain themselves!

185
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,541
How's it going detectives?

186
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,875
Has your inspection turned
up any promising leads?

187
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,083
No, sir. Everything's
normal in your data.

188
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,000
Think fast, Yellow-Green!

189
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,125
You going to the crapper to
eat your lunch alone again!

190
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,500
Why are those guys
bullying him. It's mean.

191
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,875
Oh, that. He'll be fine.
Harmless teasing.

192
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:35,916
What?

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,125
Yeah it happens
all the time to him.

194
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,500
Since the guys here
aren't allowed any contact

195
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,958
with the outside world while
on shift, teasing someone

196
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,666
is the best way to let off steam

197
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,625
and get their minds
off things for a bit.

198
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,916
Yeah, but what
if that poor guy's...

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,041
If his Psycho-Pass
ever gets clouded

200
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,625
to the point that
it's a problem,

201
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,000
we'll just re-assign him to a
different part of the factory.

202
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,458
we take our workers' mental
states quite seriously.

203
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,250
He's not being bullied,
he's actually helping us.

204
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,291
For all we know, Sibyl
might have recommended

205
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,166
he work here because
he's naturally suited

206
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,500
to this kind of
whipping boy role.

207
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,958
And someone like you, who's
quick to laugh off abuse,

208
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,125
must be naturally suited
to a job like this.

209
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,333
Sibyl System always
gets it right.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,875
You okay, buddy?

211
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,791
Yeah, thank you.

212
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,916
If the files the Chief
gave us are accurate.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
There's only one employee here

214
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,541
who's Hue Check
slowly worsens over time.

215
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,958
And every time it changes,
that guy's transferred

216
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,375
to another part of
the factory to stabilize.

217
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,166
That said, it's been a year
since his last transfer.

218
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,708
Well, wait,
didn't Chief Goda say

219
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,666
that the first debugger's death
happened about a year ago?

220
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,500
And the same man for
the last year has been

221
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,708
the target of that
twisted bullying campaign.

222
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,500
The data we got leaves
no doubt about it.

223
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,541
I see a big board of
Psycho-Passes with clear colors,

224
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,250
and then one employee
who gets cloudy.

225
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,208
Mister Yuji Kanehara.
His Hue is yellow green.

226
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:22,458
So that's why they were
calling him "Yellow-Green."

227
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,541
I guess it's company policy
to put the Hue Checks out

228
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,125
in the open for
all employees to see.

229
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,875
That is a bad idea.

230
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,208
I'll say. But this guy's
most recent assessment

231
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,583
actually shows his
Hue improving a bit.

232
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
Yeah, the Hue looks like
it was at its most cloudy.

233
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,791
The day before Shioyama died.

234
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,666
Can't be. It doesn't
work like that.

235
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,291
The color of a person's
Psycho-Pass doesn't

236
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,541
just improve after
committing murder.

237
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,500
Don't forget, though, that
we're seeing this principle

238
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,916
at work when the other
debuggers relieve their stress

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,250
by beating up on Kanehara.

240
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,666
There's no mystery here guys.

241
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,666
Back before we
had cymatic scans,

242
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,958
desperate people getting pushed
past their breaking points

243
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,583
and then committing
crimes wasn't uncommon.

244
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,958
That's enough!

245
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,458
I'm tired of hearing
about your gut feelings!

246
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,250
You're just deluding yourself!

247
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,958
With that kinda
paranoia and aggression

248
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,625
it's no wonder you latent
criminals are society's garbage!

249
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,500
We can't go around
acting on hunches

250
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,250
from circumstantial evidence!

251
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,708
We maintain an orderly society

252
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,791
by using Sibyl to judge
Crime Coefficients.

253
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,958
If we change that, we'll
lose the public's trust!

254
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,875
You crow about order

255
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,583
and yet we're still here
investigating three dead people.

256
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,750
Gino, let me do it.

257
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,708
Let me investigate Kanehara.

258
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,750
If there's hard evidence,
I'll find it.

259
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,416
That's enough!

260
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,041
Sir, can we speak, please?

261
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
I agree with the Enforcers.

262
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,833
If going by the book means
ignoring certain possibilities,

263
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,666
I'd rather try Mr. Kogami's plan

264
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,416
Oh, come on.
You can't be serious!

265
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,916
Ginoza, why are you
acting so strange!

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,041
Did something happen
between you and Masaoka?

267
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,875
Uh, sorry.

268
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,750
I promise I'll do better
with the Enforcers, sir!

269
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,541
Well then,

270
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,375
if this is the path
you're determined to take,

271
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,958
I won't stop you.

272
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,041
You are still an
Inspector, after all.

273
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,083
If you think you can
control those hunting dogs,

274
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,583
you're certainly
entitled to try.

275
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,625
Thank you, sir?

276
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,416
You've chosen
the way of the fool.

277
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,750
So like a fool, you will have
to learn through experience.

278
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,208
Seems that's the only
way you'll understand.

279
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,000
Did something once happen

280
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,833
between Mister Ginoza
and Mister Masaoka?

281
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,125
Akane, tell me you did not
ask the Senior Inspector

282
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,333
that to his face!

283
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,250
Don't talk about that.ever.

284
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,000
What?

285
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,666
I count exactly two hundred
meters in communication cables.

286
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,916
Looks like the furthest

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,666
that'll reach is the elevator
hall on the second floor.

288
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,625
You sure you can lure
Kanehara up there?

289
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,333
No, but I'm certainly gonna try.

290
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,500
So...

291
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,958
The plan is just to
talk to him, right?

292
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,125
Yeah.

293
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,458
So this is where
you hide, Yellow-Green!

294
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,291
Do your meals taste better
after you kill someone?

295
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,375
Well? Hey! Answer me!

296
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,416
Shioyama, Asami, Koriyama.

297
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,666
Three dead this year.

298
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,166
You killed them, didn't you!

299
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,000
What? Why would you think that?

300
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,000
Lucky for you, as long
as you stay in here,

301
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,458
we can't prove
you're a murderer.

302
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,375
But Yuji.
Once I get a gut feeling...

303
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,250
Well, let's just
say we Enforcers

304
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,833
take pleasure in pushing
around other latent criminals.

305
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,000
First I'm gonna keep you trapped
in this hellhole of a factory.

306
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,250
so you have no where
to run to and hide.

307
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,208
Then my friends and I are
gonna put the word on the Net.

308
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,458
Yuji Kanehara is
a serial murderer

309
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,958
with a clouded Psycho-Pass.

310
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,708
Please. Don't.

311
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,250
Dammit.

312
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,583
I'm out of service
range in here. Oh, well.

313
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,375
Guess I'll have to
go out front for a bit.

314
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,000
You stay in this
bathroom on your knees,

315
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,875
trembling and crying
like a little baby.

316
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,083
And I'll get started

317
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,250
on bringing a three-time
murderer to justice.

318
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,250
Hey! What are you doing?!

319
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,958
Kogami, why'd you do that?

320
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,250
This is the quickest
way we got left

321
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,458
for seeing if Kanehara's
our murderer.

322
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,833
He doesn't have time to prepare
an elaborate method in advance.

323
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,041
I'm safe now.

324
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,541
So, if he's gonna kill me,

325
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
he'll have to do it the exact
same way he did Shioyama.

326
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,916
When he makes his move,
we'll have our proof.

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,458
This is crazy!

328
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,791
And if he's not
a murderous nut,

329
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,666
we'll walk out of this factory
without a scratch on us.

330
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,500
In that scenario,
everybody wins.

331
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,750
So inspector, which
ending would you bet on?

332
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,083
I don't...

333
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,875
This is all your fault!

334
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,291
Looks like we have
our answer. It worked.

335
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,208
Once I'm done
killing the two of you.

336
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,750
My Hue will become clean again!

337
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,083
Run!

338
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,750
Don't run.

339
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,916
You're just going
to make your deaths

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,333
that much messier
when I catch you!

341
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,458
No! God Dammit!

342
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,500
Why would you
gamble with our lives

343
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,083
just to prove a point to Ginoza!

344
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,625
It's not about proving a point,

345
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,833
it's about getting
justice for the dead.

346
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Sometimes when you want
to uncover the truth,

347
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,125
you have to be prepared
to risk your life.

348
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,875
If we don't speed
up we won't make it!

349
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,458
You don't have to
tell me that, I know!

350
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,708
We're here.

351
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,291
I know. But right now
he's still in the act.

352
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,500
We gotta send a call for backup.

353
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,000
Suppression System, online.

354
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,583
Kogami!

355
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,000
Now you die!

356
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,166
User identification.
Enforcer Shinya Kogami.

357
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,750
Crime Coefficient at
Two Hundred Sixty-Five.

358
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,458
Suspect is target for
enforcement action.

359
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,666
Kogami, run!

360
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,916
Threat Judgment
of target is updating.

361
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,083
Enforcement Mode changed
to Destroy Decomposer.

362
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,208
Target is to be
completely eliminated.

363
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,833
Please be careful!

364
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,625
Here, too!

365
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,750
Kogami!

366
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,666
Man, those Dominators
kick serious ass

367
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,833
when they get fired up.

368
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,541
He said he didn't want
to be some hunting dog,

369
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,625
he wanted to be a detective.

370
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,916
But the look I saw in
his eyes that night.

371
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,791
Was more like that of
a wolf who had its prey

372
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,875
by the neck and couldn't
wait to taste blood.
