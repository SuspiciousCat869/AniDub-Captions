inexplicable injuries...

their whereabouts over
the last eleven days.

Do you approve?

You stoop to ask permission?

coy of you, Makina.

Ma'am...

Would you like me to rub

Have the members
been chosen?

Yes ma'am...

I've gone over the
Promoter's secret list

in particular

00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,083
fits the bill
perfectly, I believe.
