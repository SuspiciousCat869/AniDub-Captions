1
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,791
Stop running, goddammit!

2
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,458
Yeah, like I'm gonna stop
'cause you fuckin' told me to!

3
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,750
Son of a bitch!

4
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,750
Sorry, asshole. Game over.

5
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,958
What the fuck...
The fuck is that?

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Stop...! I give up okay?!

7
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,458
"Yeah, like I'm gonna stop...

8
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,458
'cause you fucking' told me to!"

9
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,583
Senji! Enough!

10
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,375
You're a damn cop now...

11
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,250
You can't just kill people.

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,750
You lucked out, asshole.

13
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:06,000
♪ opening song ♪

14
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,666
What're the odds of that...?!

15
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,000
That bastard knew we
were staking him out...!

16
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,375
It's almost like somebody
told 'em we were comin'!

17
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,125
C'mon, I don't
even know the guy!

18
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,583
Okay, who gave that fucker
the heads-up, then...?! Huh?!

19
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,541
Aaaw, give it a rest, Senji...

20
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,750
You probably told
him your damn self.

21
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,958
Huh...? The hell you say?

22
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,541
Sounds right to me...

23
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,083
He probably he caught wind of it
from his old pal, Officer Senji.

24
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,708
You're a cop now...

25
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,375
But don't think sporting a badge

26
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,375
automatically means your
past ain't fair game...

27
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,708
What'd you say?!

28
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,833
You... asshole...!

29
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,416
Jeez, you never learn, do ya...

30
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,875
I mean...

31
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,833
you always end up getting in
someone's face about something,

32
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,333
and then you go right
for the left hook.

33
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,916
You're wasting
your breath, man...

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,208
Trying to reason with him is
like talking to a damn wall.

35
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,875
Yeah, I know, but...
if he keeps raising hell,

36
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,833
they'll rake us over the
coals on our next write-up.

37
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,166
Well... at least you
know he's got grit!

38
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,416
That's great...

39
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,166
but he keeps tracking
it into the precinct...

40
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,750
[loud thud]

41
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,750
What's up with you, Senji?
Something wrong?

42
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,458
Can't breathe is all...

43
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,791
Feels like I'm choking.

44
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,666
Want me to crack a
window or something?

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,875
I'm taking a walk.

46
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,666
Hey... Where're you going?

47
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,000
Huh...?

48
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,625
Looks like the Chief
tore ya a new asshole.

49
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
Yeah, more o' less...

50
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,916
He seems to think that Senji is
more trouble than he's worth.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,583
That's pretty tough
talk from a man

52
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,416
who's up to his
nostrils in graft.

53
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,166
You did this to yourself
when you brought in

54
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,583
that stray of yours,
Domon ol' pal...

55
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,708
You get to clean up after him.

56
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,583
Yeah, so I did...

57
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,833
Us old farts always have
to look after the young'uns.

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,125
Wait... isn't that...?

59
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,333
A couple o' thugs
from Goreless Peace.

60
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,958
I never heard of 'em.

61
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,375
They're a gang...

62
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,541
Been calling themselves
the neighborhood watch...

63
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,000
but all they ever watch
out for is our money...

64
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,041
Criminals, every one of 'em.

65
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,958
Ain't the only gang...
but they're the worst.

66
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:15,208
No! Leggo, you jerk!
What's the big idea...?!

67
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,416
Well... seems we got
ourselves a little thief.

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,458
Kid's got balls,
liftin' with us around.

69
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,458
I betcha can't steal
one-handed...

70
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,958
Only one way to find out...

71
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,458
I only gotta...

72
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,625
'cause you guys have been
squelching all the rations...!

73
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,875
Sons o' bitches!

74
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,833
I'm sorry...!
I didn't quite catch that...

75
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,333
Who'd you say are
sons o' bitches?!

76
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,708
You dumb-shits.

77
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,250
What the fu--?!

78
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,875
Holy shit, look at the
size of that knife...!

79
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,875
Wait a sec... that's
not a knife, is it...?

80
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,625
Honestly? I don't know what
the hell this is either...

81
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,250
All I know for sure...

82
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,333
...is that it cuts through trash
like you real fucking good!

83
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,041
It hurts... Oh man, it hurts...!

84
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,041
C'mon...! You'll get
yours later, pig!

85
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,666
You're the man, Senji!

86
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,833
You're damn right I am.

87
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,333
Hey.

88
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,958
Izuru...!

89
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,500
What have you
gotten into now...?!

90
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,208
I'm sorry, Senji, I should have
watched him more carefully--

91
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,541
Hey, it's all good...

92
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,791
Just ground his ass... Go.

93
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,500
Don't tell me you
were stealing again.

94
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, ma'am...

95
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,458
I'm sorry, Miss Hinata.

96
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,958
Hinata!

97
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,291
Damn... So he stole
a little--calm down...!

98
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,750
Why are you defending him?!

99
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,750
I... I'm sorry.

100
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,958
Wow, I just yelled at a cop...!

101
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,875
Nah... it's okay...
Just don't hit me...

102
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,125
I just dunno how you do it...

103
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,833
I'm serious, Hinata...

104
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,750
Taking in all these
street kids...?

105
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,083
And paying for it outta
pocket like ya do...?

106
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,041
Please, it's not like
I'm some sort of saint...

107
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,583
I mean...

108
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,375
part of the reason I'm doing
all this is out of vengeance.

109
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,041
Vengeance, huh?

110
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
Two years, it's been...

111
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,000
since the day that the
earthquake changed everything...

112
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,875
But still...

113
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,083
We can't stop
being decent people

114
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,958
just 'cause we got the rug
yanked out from under us...

115
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,458
Now more than ever,

116
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,083
I'm not going to let those
kids slip through the cracks.

117
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,750
If I can keep them
safe and happy...

118
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,916
It kinda feels like...
I'm flipping off the quake.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,958
Flippin' it off... Huh.

120
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,166
That's right...
Show it who's boss!

121
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,625
Uh-huh!

122
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,166
Man, it got hot all of a sudden!

123
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,625
You hot? 'Cause I'm sweatin'!

124
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,125
Oh yeah?

125
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,208
Someday I'm gonna be
strong as you, Senji!

126
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,708
Keep dreaming, kid...

127
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,291
This bad-ass is one of a kind.

128
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,833
I'll be... like... the
defender of the orphanage!

129
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,375
Be a cop...
You get free tomatoes.

130
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,916
Very interesting weaponry...

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,750
You're Senji Kiyomasa,
aren't you?

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,208
Keigo Ugachi is the name...

133
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,458
I take it you're familiar
with our little organization.

134
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,583
Think of me as Goreless
Peace's liaison.

135
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,708
It's precisely as I thought...

136
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,458
Our souls are simpatico!

137
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,875
Afraid not!

138
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,958
Well, my dear Senji...
I have an offer for you...

139
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,541
Would you care to help me
re-tune this atonal world?

140
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
"Re-tune?"

141
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:44,333
The Red Hole shook this
town--this whole world--

142
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,000
and everything's been
out of key ever since...

143
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:51,708
So I'm going to tighten
the proverbial strings.

144
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,708
And as soon everything is
pitch-perfect once again...

145
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:59,333
the song I play upon it
will be a thing of beauty!

146
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,083
You're an idiot.

147
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,541
That uniform looks
pretty... constricting.

148
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,416
What the fuck...?!

149
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,166
It must be a ball, officer...

150
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,875
Making sure your necktie
is tied just right...

151
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,708
Licking the boot soles of
those who lord above you...

152
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,541
Dealing with the
dregs of humanity,

153
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,166
day after
soul-crushing day...!

154
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,708
The very thought of it
sets my head a-throbbing!

155
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:34,125
Whereas I... am
with Goreless Peace.

156
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,500
We're working towards an
idyllic world for all to enjoy.

157
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,458
But somebody has to tighten
the strings first, don't they?

158
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,416
Is that why you beat
up little kids...?

159
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,750
Because it's all part
of your Kumbaya crap?

160
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,583
Re-tuning can be physical.

161
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,333
In time, I'm sure
you'll see it my way.

162
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,500
We're simpatico.

163
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,291
Bastard...!

164
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,250
I'll cut off your goddamn mouth!

165
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,291
You're a rare bird
indeed, Senji...

166
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,125
I do look forward to
our next conversation.

167
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,875
Yeah, blow it out your ass.

168
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,708
Stupid kid...!

169
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,541
Giving me unripe tomatoes...!

170
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,250
You're pretty green yourself,
so what's the problem?

171
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,291
Another coffin-nail, huh...?

172
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,125
That shit's gonna kill you,
ya know that, right?

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,875
There's not much a man calls
the shots on these days...

174
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,458
but his death is
still one of 'em.

175
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,833
Whole damn world's going
down the crapper...

176
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,541
We lock these fuckers up,
and for what?

177
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,708
Somebody's gotta give
the ol' girl a scrub...

178
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,375
The world needs fools like us...

179
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,500
Like you, Senji.

180
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,916
Tell me something, old man...

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,125
What made you think I'd
be worth a damn at this?

182
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,458
If it's heads, you walk the beat
tomorrow and I play solitaire...

183
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,083
If it's tails, you sleep in.

184
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,750
Hey, looks like
it's heads... Huh?

185
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,791
Why, you cheating
son of a bitch!

186
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,833
And grab some of those for me

187
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,250
while you're out
and about, okay...?

188
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,708
I mean, if...
you're gonna stop by.

189
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,166
Huh...?

190
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,125
Damn...

191
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,166
You just think ya know
everything--dontcha, old man!

192
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
Oh, yes...

193
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,875
I find him intriguing,
albeit brutish...

194
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,375
And, if he doesn't come
'round on his own...

195
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,875
I'll think of something.

196
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,166
Yes... Yes, you're
quite right, Mr. Akatsuki.

197
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,500
Senji's one of us...

198
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,583
but he has yet to
arrive at that truth.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,958
What am I grinning about...?

200
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,625
just going to see a bunch
of snot-nosed brats.

201
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:44,541
[siren wails]

202
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,833
God... They were just... kids...

203
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,125
Hinata!

204
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,958
Say something... Please!

205
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,875
Izuru...! You gotta hold on...!

206
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
Don't you die on me.

207
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,166
I could've... saved 'em...

208
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,375
if I'd just been...
as strong as you are, Senji...

209
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,333
Come on...
Just open your eyes...

210
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,875
Open your eyes, dammit!

211
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,666
Senji, come in...!

212
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,791
I know you can
hear me, dammit...!

213
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,083
Talk to me...!

214
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,458
I'm here.

215
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,375
Look, son...
You gotta come back!

216
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,750
No...

217
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,125
Not before I kill all
those motherfuckers.

218
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,750
You're not a killer!

219
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,083
Why, 'cause I'm a cop...?

220
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,541
Then you can have
my fucking badge...

221
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,708
But I gotta do this.

222
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,666
Goddamn it...

223
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,333
Goreless Peace?
The dude's toast.

224
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,833
That dumbshit.
Easier to leave 'em be.

225
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,000
Get himself a little
spending money...

226
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,583
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm glad the fucker's out...

227
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,458
He never was a team player.

228
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,958
You watch your damn mouth!

229
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,458
Hell, we can cook
up the paperwork.

230
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,208
"Check it out, guys, is
that a gang fight I hear?"

231
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,375
And our write-ups
can suck a dick.

232
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,125
Yeah, suck a big one!

233
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,583
Look at ya...

234
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,041
What the hell am I gonna
do with this buncha lugs?

235
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Our guest of honor
has arrived...

236
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,208
This mutton I've procured for
our meal is simply to die for.

237
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,666
The younger the lamb,
the richer the blood, they say.

238
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:46,000
I trust that you happened upon
the invitation I left you.

239
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,208
Those orphans were a
millstone tied to your neck...

240
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,166
but now you are free to
join us without hesitation.

241
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,500
Alas...

242
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,791
Our world is so cacophonous,
it turns my stomach.

243
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,208
Take friendship...

244
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,583
or legends like
compassion and honor...

245
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,416
Or even that old wives
tale, true love...

246
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,875
You're far too magnificent
to be hampered by all that.

247
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:15,208
Not you, O Righteous Wielder
of the Crimson Blades...

248
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,708
...who's murdered dozens
in the blink of an eye.

249
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,083
We are birds of a feather,
you and I...!

250
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,666
Now...! Let us plan
our conquest...!

251
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,250
We will tune this
world togeth--!

252
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,583
I didn't come here to join your
new-world-order marching band...

253
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,250
I came here to kill your ass.

254
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,000
What a terrible shame...

255
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,583
I figured that you...
would understand me.

256
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,500
Like hell are we letting
you do this by yourself.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,541
There's ten of these goons
for every one of us.

258
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,166
We'll take 'em on an
illegal weapons charge.

259
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,791
You guys are screwwwed!

260
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,375
Aw shit!

261
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,791
Ugachi! Show yourself!

262
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,416
What the hell?

263
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,708
Come now, Senji.

264
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,458
I said we were simpatico.

265
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,708
You bastard...!

266
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,458
Like those pesky orphans
we had to massacre,

267
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,583
you are simply too loud.

268
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,958
Oh hush, now...

269
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,250
I've had enough
screaming for today.

270
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:39,250
Those caterwauling brats
put my stomach on edge!

271
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,916
Do you know what a perfect
melody would sound like?

272
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,791
It would sound like nothing.
Like order itself.

273
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,125
The music of the spheres...!

274
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
This would be a world
in which silence swells

275
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,041
to a deafening crescendo!

276
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:59,000
Fuck your melody...!
I'm gonna cut you in half!

277
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,250
And you'll be doing that how?

278
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,041
Why even try...?

279
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,625
My crimson cords will transfix
you fast where you stand...

280
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,958
Within the Wire Lyre!

281
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,458
Mine don't have some
pussy-ass nickname...!

282
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,083
But they still get the job done!

283
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,500
See...? You can't even get
within slicing range.

284
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,083
Senji!

285
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,666
How barbaric...!

286
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,208
You just barrel in during
my pièce de résistance...!

287
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,958
Old man!

288
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,250
I'll just usher you
out... of life!

289
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,875
What?!

290
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,833
You mean to kill me...

291
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,000
Just get on with it, then.

292
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,666
Well...? What are
you waiting for, Senji?

293
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,958
Send me to the abyss.

294
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,625
Stand down!

295
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,500
Don't you listen to him...

296
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,875
Damn it, son...

297
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:13,416
If you kill this fucker,
you're no better than he is!

298
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,041
Yeah, I know.

299
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,250
You're a fool.

300
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,541
Senji!

301
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,125
Huh...?

302
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,333
You flinched...

303
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,666
It's tough bringing
'em up right.

304
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:10,875
So... Ogachee's in
police custody...

305
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,291
Yes... I understand.

306
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,625
Senji Kiyomasa...

307
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,708
I wonder if you will
stand with me someday...

308
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,000
or against me?

309
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,000
Gonna be privatized--
that the word?

310
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,208
Uh-huh.

311
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,041
The times, they are
a-changing, fellas...

312
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,416
Theme park vibe or not,

313
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,583
it's still gonna be full
of the same ol' shit.

314
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:07,166
And we're the lucky schmucks
who get to put 'em in there.

315
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,875
You heard him, ladies...
Back to work.

316
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,583
--Yeah.
--Fine.

317
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,250
Old man!

318
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,666
Huh?

319
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,333
Oh! Son-of-a...! What the...?
