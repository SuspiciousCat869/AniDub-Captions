[HIME]
We all hide things.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.493 position:50% align:center
Everyone has their secrets.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
On my eighteenth birthday,

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
I received the key
to Pandora's Box.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.793 position:50% align:center
And inside of it...

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
...was my father's secret.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
He drew manga for a living.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.678 position:50% align:center
I also discovered that the
layout of the house in Kamakura

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
was the same as our
house in Nakameguro.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:01.270 position:50% align:center
I found out that my dad had
kept making boxes for me.

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:04.648 position:50% align:center
And that the house in Kamakura
was originally meant

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.819 position:50% align:center
for my father, mother,
and I to live in together.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.280 position:50% align:center
I learned everything.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.951 position:50% align:center
What a strange thing to hide.

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
I wonder why Dad
quit drawing manga.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Who are you?

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.962 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you... Sister.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.297 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Huh?

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
Does that mean that you're
my dad's love child?

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.265 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Hmph.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.933 position:50% align:center
Not quite.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Okay. So then, in that
case, am I the love child?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:26.123 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it,
either. Actually, it's...

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.126 position:50% align:center
[HIME] My dad was
the secret love child?

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.588 position:50% align:center
How could you
possibly know that?

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:36.550 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Didn't I see you
on TV the other day?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
You're that up-and-coming
kabuki actor

00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:42.306 position:50% align:center
who just received his new name.
I forgot what it was.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's kinda insulting.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] He's the child of a
kabuki actor and his mistress.

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.188 position:50% align:center
So you knew?

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. He always
had a flare for drama.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.443 position:50% align:center
I suppose that makes sense.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
He could have easily been
a kabuki actor himself.

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:01.158 position:50% align:center
Yeah, life is funny.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
Look. It's by Kairi Imashigata.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
Hime's maternal grandfather
is quite the painter.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.585 position:50% align:center
Hime's grandfather, huh?
Yeah, he's definitely talented.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
I mean when you think about it,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.881 position:50% align:center
Hime's from a long
line of artists.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] An actor, a painter,
a manga artist, and a pianist.

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.221 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] That's probably why the
boss didn't get along with him.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
Not because he was
a manga artist,

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
but because they were just
incompatible artists period.

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.354 position:50% align:center
Guess they couldn't
help but clash.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] So yeah, I guess the
best way to explain it is,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.776 position:50% align:center
your dad and my mom
are half siblings.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.321 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Wow, I never knew my dad
had a younger sister.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Are you surprised?

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.785 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Honestly? Not really.
I'm relieved Dad and I

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
are actually related.
Does that make sense?

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:52.626 position:50% align:center
Wait, was there something
that made you think you weren't?

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
It sounds dumb, but...
He was just too nice.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST A] Yes, I'm afraid
the incident you're referring to

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
involves personal information,
so unfortunately,

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
you're going to have
to go through a lawyer.

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.974 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.394 position:50% align:center
Hold up!

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.937 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Hm?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
I was actually working with Goto
on the day of the incident.

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
I see. You're investigating
what happened?

00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:22.823 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.
All of this is off the record.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Then why are you
asking about it?

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
Personal interest, mostly.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.580 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
If I can find out the truth,

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.874 position:50% align:center
then maybe we can
turn things around.

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.876 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't be telling you this.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.297 position:50% align:center
Truth is, that accident
wasn't Goto's fault.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.009 position:50% align:center
[FORMER COWORKER] No way! So all
of these are copies of Jumpo?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yep.

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
[FORMER COWORKER] I thought
the publishing industry was

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.556 position:50% align:center
done for, but looks like
it's still going strong!

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sighs]
Let's get this over with.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.581 position:50% align:center
[siren blaring]

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:17.044 position:50% align:center
[FORMER COWORKER] Goto! You
okay? Someone call an ambulance!

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Goto!

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
[FORMER COWORKER]
The reason the pallet fell apart

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
is because someone
took out a copy to read.

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
It could be because
they wanted a sneak peek,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.598 position:50% align:center
or maybe they wanted
to post spoilers.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.185 position:50% align:center
Whatever the reason,
it was against company policy.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.646 position:50% align:center
But I highly doubt it was Goto.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.649 position:50% align:center
He told me once
that he hated manga.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
Probably.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
[NURSE A] It's the patient
in this room, correct?

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
[NURSE B]
Yes. For over a year now.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
It's a bit ironic, isn't it?

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.085 position:50% align:center
Manga was his life, and
when he tried to step away,

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.837 position:50% align:center
it literally crushed him.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
It's like karma.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.925 position:50% align:center
If it weren't Jumpo, if it
were Saturday or Mangazine,

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
then they would
never have had piles

00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.220 position:50% align:center
big enough to hurt anybody.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
Um, rude. Anyway,
back then he was doing

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.641 position:50% align:center
all kinds of physical labor

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
even though he clearly
wasn't cut out for it.

00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Money was apparently
really tight.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
It got so bad that he
ended up selling his house.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I thought he
had savings, though.

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Yeah, but he used all of it.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.699 position:50% align:center
When he was trying
to find his wife.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.870 position:50% align:center
She was lost at sea not
long after Hime was born.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
They eventually
called off the search,

00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:37.833 position:50% align:center
but he never gave up hope.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.170 position:50% align:center
Deep down, he believed
she was still alive.

00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:42.588 position:50% align:center
And he was paying
a professional

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
to look for her for over
ten years as he drew manga.

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:49.970 position:50% align:center
Around the same time that
Hime started middle school,

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
the tabloids somehow
got wind of the fact

00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
that he was still
looking for his wife.

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:56.894 position:50% align:center
They ran it as a
public interest piece,

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.021 position:50% align:center
but it backfired.

00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:07.571 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Not long after,
he put his pen down for good.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
He felt abandoned
by his readers.

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:14.203 position:50% align:center
A sad story, but he still gave
<i>Tights</i> a proper ending.

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Yeah, the final
chapter was pretty decent.

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] It was a rough
time because he lost

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
both his work and livelihood,
but he still had Hime.

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Right, and he managed

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:27.049 position:50% align:center
to get her through high school
without any trouble.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.885 position:50% align:center
What's even more interesting

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
is that Hime seems to have
taken after her grandfather

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:35.766 position:50% align:center
and inherited his
amazing painting skills.

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Back when he was drawing
manga, and even after he quit,

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
my father always smiled
in front of me.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
He really was too nice.

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] My mom used to say
the same thing.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.197 position:50% align:center
You were always his
top priority, though.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.200 position:50% align:center
So was she the one who
gave me the key earlier?

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was her.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
This is for Hime.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.916 position:50% align:center
Look, if something ever
suddenly happened to me,

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
please just sell
everything inside.

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
Give her the proceeds
so she can survive.

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:08.674 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much.

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:11.677 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
Mm! Wait a second.
The place isn't empty, though.

00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Your dad
was embarrassed by it,

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:23.981 position:50% align:center
but I think my mother
wanted you to see for yourself.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
What your dad did for a living.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:31.113 position:50% align:center
Yes, and now I know...
about his secret ambition.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:35.659 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Huh? What'd you say?

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:42.291 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna head home now.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Huh?

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure what I would
do if you started crying

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
or something. But you seem fine.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.549 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm okay.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:51.550 position:50% align:center
[BOY A grunts]

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Hime!

00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.721 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Ms. Ichiko? Everyone?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.598 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hottie alert, am I right?

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.141 position:50% align:center
Not the time!

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:02.144 position:50% align:center
It's your father. Apparently,
he's regained consciousness.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.271 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.148 position:50% align:center
But that's good news, right?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
Well, it's complicated.

00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
He's awake?

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.507 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Dad?

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.636 position:50% align:center
[HIME gasping]

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.889 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
But who are you?

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:45.312 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] What? He has amnesia,
talk about cliché!

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
That worn out plot device
wouldn't work in a manga!

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Keep your voice down.
We're in a hospital.

00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:52.611 position:50% align:center
He came back to life,
don't question it.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.655 position:50% align:center
He was never dead, dummy.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:59.785 position:50% align:center
Hey, boss, did you seriously
forget about Hime?

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:04.790 position:50% align:center
Huh? You really think I'd
forget my own daughter?

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.960 position:50% align:center
She's only ten.
She needs me.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] These images show
that he can only recall memories

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.381 position:50% align:center
from when you were
ten years old.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.550 position:50% align:center
Anything that happened after
that particular time period

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
is simply blocked.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Why that specific time period?

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.097 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
There must be
something significant

00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
about those particular memories.

00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:27.104 position:50% align:center
It's actually pretty common
in these sorts of cases.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.941 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
So he's stuck in the past?

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.652 position:50% align:center
[AMI] That's right,
when Hime was only ten.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] But what happened back
then that was so significant?

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.115 position:50% align:center
[AOGU grunts]

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
Well, that was probably when
he was having the most fun.

00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
At the studio and at home.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Of course.

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.250 position:50% align:center
I was his editor, after all.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Yeah, that's not why.

00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:50.711 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Get off of me!

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:52.004 position:50% align:center
[NURSE D]
Please, sir!

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
You have to go through
physical therapy

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.966 position:50% align:center
and build up your strength
before you can leave!

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.177 position:50% align:center
--Whoa, dude!
--What's going on here?

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.970 position:50% align:center
He tried to make a run for it!

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.013 position:50% align:center
Uh?!

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.849 position:50% align:center
Just let me go!
I have to see Hime!

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.601 position:50% align:center
[NURSE D]
Mister Goto, please calm down

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.852 position:50% align:center
before you hurt yourself.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
I understand you want to
be with Hime right now,

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:13.734 position:50% align:center
but seeing you in this state
isn't going to help anything.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.736 position:50% align:center
Mm, yeah, you're right.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:19.990 position:50% align:center
She'd be worried, and I don't
want to do that to her.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
Just focus on physical therapy
and getting back to normal.

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
You're already off
to a great start,

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
and at least you can
move your fingers!

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh... My fingers?

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:36.924 position:50% align:center
In that case, bring me
some blank paper, guys.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
Time for us to finish
drawing <i>Tights</i> !

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:40.511 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.930 position:50% align:center
Uh. But that series
ended forever ago.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
You and your dumb jokes!

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.935 position:50% align:center
For some reason, he thinks
the series is still running!

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.062 position:50% align:center
Okay, so tell him the truth.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
That would be a major
shock to his system.

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
So then, what's our next step?

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.370 position:50% align:center
Why are we doing this?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
Man, I can't remember the last
time we all worked together.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.083 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's been forever

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:14.086 position:50% align:center
since I've sat down and
drawn like this, you know?

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[HIME gasping]

00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:19.967 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Oh, wow.
So this is my dad's work.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Hey, you there.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.845 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes?

00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I don't recognize you,
are you a new assistant?

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
Oh, me? Uh-huh.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.685 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Since we're so busy,

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:32.813 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if you'd mind
doing me a small favor?

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
Sure, what is it?

00:13:34.273 --> 00:13:36.942 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
my daughter, Hime.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
Our housekeeper usually
comes later in the day.

00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
But I was hoping
you'd sit with Hime

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.950 position:50% align:center
until she got there,
so she doesn't get lonely.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
I asked Satsuki to do it once,
but he was utterly useless.

00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.831 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hey, I heard that!

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:54.251 position:50% align:center
Anyway, do you mind
sitting with her?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Not at all.

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:58.130 position:50% align:center
Thank you. There's still some
time before she gets home

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.717 position:50% align:center
from school. You can
relax until then.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
Hey, boss--

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
But I--

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:10.267 position:50% align:center
Please just ask me
if you need anything else

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
at all between now
and then. 'Kay, Boss?

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
Hime.

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Need some help?

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:34.166 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something?

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:37.294 position:50% align:center
Did you honestly not realize
your father's secret?

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.505 position:50% align:center
About his job?

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
I didn't. It sounds silly,
but it's true.

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:48.514 position:50% align:center
Instead I allowed myself to be
spoiled by my father's kindness.

00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:51.517 position:50% align:center
However, watching him work,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
I can tell he truly
loves drawing manga.

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:59.024 position:50% align:center
It was the first time
I've ever seen him working.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.318 position:50% align:center
He was concentrating so hard,

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
but he looked like he
was having a lot of fun.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.782 position:50% align:center
If my father getting his
memories back means

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
he won't be able to draw again,
then maybe this is for the best.

00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Hold on.
Just what are you saying?

00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
That you're okay with him
forgetting about you?

00:15:18.544 --> 00:15:21.547 position:50% align:center
[RIKO] Are you serious
about this, Hime?

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.215 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm-hm.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's what
you really want.

00:15:26.677 --> 00:15:27.970 position:50% align:center
Sorry, guys.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
It's fine, but if you
change your mind,

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.974 position:50% align:center
make sure that you tell us, kay?

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
Meguro River Detective Agency

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.103 position:50% align:center
will have your back
no matter what.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Me, too. I'll help
out however I can, Hime.

00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
After all, you are my savior.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.654 position:50% align:center
Thank you, guys.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.160 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home.

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.582 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I left you
alone all day.

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.298 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Here. It's finished.
Don't lose it.

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I can't believe
you're still drawing!

00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:08.177 position:50% align:center
What's that even mean?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Whoa, he's picked up
exactly where he left off

00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
seven years ago.

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
To be fair, he's already drawn
this stuff once before.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally.

00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:18.854 position:50% align:center
If he keeps up this pace,
he might actually remember

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
everything in seven years or so.

00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
I really do think we need
to tell him the truth.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
No, he has to
remember on his own.

00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:27.613 position:50% align:center
Otherwise it could
make things worse.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.156 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] You don't have
to worry about us!

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.200 position:50% align:center
We'll keep doing our
best for the bossman.

00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
I'm only asking because
I want Rasuna back.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.331 position:50% align:center
After all, she's one of
our top creators right now.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
I can take a break
for the next issue.

00:16:40.918 --> 00:16:44.213 position:50% align:center
Look at him.
He loves drawing manga.

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:47.216 position:50% align:center
You can tell by how
much fun he's having.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
I can't remember the last
time he looked that happy.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.764 position:50% align:center
For someone like him,

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
the best form of physical
therapy is his manga.

00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:02.356 position:50% align:center
All right! Meeting time!

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:03.232 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Huh?

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
[AMI groaning]

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Hold on!

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:06.193 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
We're just having
a quick meeting

00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
to discuss our future plans!

00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:11.949 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Shouldn't I go, too?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:16.328 position:50% align:center
Uh... Um. So, uh...

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
They're all nice.

00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:21.625 position:50% align:center
I like how much your team
seems to care about you.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:25.087 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're all right.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.840 position:50% align:center
You look so happy when
you're drawing manga, sir.

00:17:27.923 --> 00:17:30.092 position:50% align:center
I can tell you really enjoy it.

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:31.969 position:50% align:center
I do?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.805 position:50% align:center
[HIME] You hid this job
that you loved for so long,

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.932 position:50% align:center
and then you had to let it go.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.101 position:50% align:center
That must have
been hard for you.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.270 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry that
I never realized it.

00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:50.279 position:50% align:center
[HIME] There's a part of me that
wants things to stay this way.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.573 position:50% align:center
As long as you're
able to draw manga,

that's what brings you
true happiness,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
and that's the life you
really want, isn't it?

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.956 position:50% align:center
No.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't make me happy.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
The truth is, the only thing
I want in this world...

00:18:08.714 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
...is for Hime to grow up
to be big and happy.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.190 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:35.282 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:37.743 position:50% align:center
Huh? Kay!

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:42.581 position:50% align:center
I need your help!
So please, whatever it takes,

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:46.627 position:50% align:center
there's something I
really have to show him!

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Watch it!

00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.923 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Dad! Dad!

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but in the end
I'm just a selfish girl!

00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
I can't help it.
I want to be with my father!

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
[HIME panting]

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:11.902 position:50% align:center
Thank you all for coming.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.904 position:50% align:center
Girl, no prob.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
It's the first case
we've had in a while.

00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
But these detectives are ready!
Prepare to roll out, ladies!

00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
You got it!

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS panting]

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.808 position:50% align:center
How much farther is it, Hime?

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
All right. We're heading
out for the night.

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:57.656 position:50% align:center
We'll come back tomorrow.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.283 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

[ALL]
Huh?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:05.414 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.290 position:50% align:center
What in the world?

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.666 position:50% align:center
Hime?

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
What's in the boxes?

00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
It's all of his old manuscripts!

00:20:15.007 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
They're yours. Please read them.

00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:18.719 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute. I don't
remember drawing this stuff.

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:27.436 position:50% align:center
And there's even more!

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.897 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.285 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
I can't believe we finished!

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.162 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Wow, we worked
so hard on this chapter,

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.623 position:50% align:center
but I feel like it's pretty
solid, you know?

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
See ya, Boss. I'm heading out.

00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:51.752 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Manuscript received!

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.171 position:50% align:center
By the way, the reader's
survey from last week

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
was surprisingly pretty decent.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
I'm sorry, sir!

00:20:57.633 --> 00:21:00.469 position:50% align:center
I erased too hard
and tore the paper!

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.429 position:50% align:center
Oh. Welcome home, Daddy!

00:21:02.513 --> 00:21:04.598 position:50% align:center
Thank you for working
so hard today.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
[ROKU barking]

[AOGU]
Don't take this the wrong way,

00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
but I think this
chapter's a bit weak.

00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:11.313 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Didn't we make
this joke, already?

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I have the most hilarious idea!

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
What if you made the golf club
shaped like a mushroom?

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.946 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Look at you go,
you're on fire today, Bossman!

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Yeah, you're like a manga demon!

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.366 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
You know what that means.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:23.617 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Get rid of the demon!

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.078 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] You just wanna
throw beans at me!

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.080 position:50% align:center
Okay! I'll play the demon,

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
and you throw the beans
at me as hard as you can.

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:34.211 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna do anything
that's gonna hurt you.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.505 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Come on!
Smile for the camera, Hime!

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
[HIME] What? But that's
so embarrassing.

00:21:38.507 --> 00:21:43.512 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What do you mean? This
is a once in a lifetime moment!

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:46.640 position:50% align:center
I am in middle school
now, so okay.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.559 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] We'll be living
here from now on.

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that
it's kinda cramped.

00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Don't worry. As long as
I'm with you, anywhere is fine.

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad.

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.237 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad!

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.408 position:50% align:center
I look forward to spending
even more time with you, Dad.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:07.995 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
You see, Dad? I'm here.

00:22:10.706 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
And I grew up to be
big and strong.

00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:17.254 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You're... my daughter.

00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:23.177 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI screaming]
Don't look at them!

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.428 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
This is a quiet zone!

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.512 position:50% align:center
--[RASUNA] He's healed!
--[KAKERU] It worked!

00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:26.638 position:50% align:center
Welcome back!

00:22:26.722 --> 00:22:28.015 position:50% align:center
A cliché ending!

00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:30.642 position:50% align:center
You let her find out!

00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:34.313 position:50% align:center
[HIME] My father had a secret.
He drew manga for a living.

00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:38.775 position:50% align:center
And that's okay. Because
I have my own secrets.

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:42.779 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A] Come on, Hime.
Draw that kind of stuff at home.

00:22:42.863 --> 00:22:45.199 position:50% align:center
You're crazy!
No way could I do that.

00:22:45.282 --> 00:22:48.827 position:50% align:center
What if my dad found
out that I drew manga?

00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:51.580 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I might keep that
secret for a bit longer.

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:54.958 position:50% align:center
At least I'm not drawing
dirty jokes or anything.

00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:57.419 position:50% align:center
Oh, and as for my dad...

00:22:57.503 --> 00:22:59.796 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What do you think
of this new project?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.299 position:50% align:center
I could use the work.
I'm up to my eyeballs in debt.

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:05.052 position:50% align:center
Gotta pay the old geezer
back for my hospital stay.

00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:08.555 position:50% align:center
So Hime's grandfather was taking
care of all your medical bills?

00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
I wonder what his angle is?

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.809 position:50% align:center
Wait. Dirty jokes again?

00:23:12.893 --> 00:23:15.187 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're okay
with Hime finding out?

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Hime's all grown up now.

00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:19.608 position:50% align:center
It won't bother her.

00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:22.361 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I've got a
brand-new story idea.

00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:23.779 position:50% align:center
There's this manga artist

00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:25.864 position:50% align:center
who wants to keep his job
secret from his daughter.

00:23:25.948 --> 00:23:27.866 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Who the hell would
wanna read that kind of trash?

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.743 position:50% align:center
I think it sounds
kinda interesting.

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:31.745 position:50% align:center
Agreed, it basically
writes itself.

00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:33.622 position:50% align:center
Satsuki's first good idea!

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:37.084 position:50% align:center
Um, you guys know this
is my studio, right?

00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:44.967 position:50% align:center
[HIME] So, tell me,
what's your secret?
