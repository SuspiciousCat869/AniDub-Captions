[KAKUSHI]
Hime. I thought you said

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
you were stocking up on
these for the New Year.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
Um. That's right.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
You told me that the stores
would all be closed

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
for the holiday. And yet...

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
They're all empty.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! The truth is,
I just can't help myself, Daddy.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
If it's in front of me
I'm going to eat it!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
[HIME cries]

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Now then!

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
If we can finish the
proofs for issue six,

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
we'll be done with work
for the rest of the year.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
Although, if we can
hurry and finish

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
the proofs for
issue seven early...

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
We'd be off until the eighth!

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
Whoa, we can take
that many days off?

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
I'm all for it, so let's
crank out issue seven!

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
Okay. We've got this, guys,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
let's finish up both issues,
then ring in the New Year!

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center
[AMI, KAKERU, RASUNA]
Yeah!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
[AOGU grumbles]

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.159 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
So what happened to all
those extra pages?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
We need you to take this
a little more seriously,

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
we can't do anything
without your manuscript.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
Jeez, cut me some slack!

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.961 position:50% align:center
Like I could really finish
that much drawing!

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.217 position:50% align:center
I need every second available to
heighten the quality of my work.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
That's how a true
manga artist rolls.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
[AOGU gasps]

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Is what I'd like to say...

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.599 position:50% align:center
The truth is I don't
have any self-control!

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
I can't help but procrastinate!

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
Man, I totally called this crap.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry
about what I did.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
Huh? Say what now?

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
You know, when I ate
all of our snacks.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
I felt so guilty.
So to punish myself,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
I practiced writing a
difficult kanji, 100 times!

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
Well, everyone has
their weaknesses.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's worth beating
yourself up over it or anything.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
So, anyway! Since you
punished yourself,

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
it's probably fine if
you wanna go buy more.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Don't you think you're
going too easy on me, Daddy?

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
At this rate,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
I'm going to end up an adult
who can't plan anything.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is that a fact?

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Planning things, huh.
Hime sure is responsible.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Aw, better luck next time!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
A lottery?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yep. I've won
something from those before.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
You wanna give it a try?

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm-hm!

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunting]
'Kay...

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Wow, the grand prize!

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
You've won a two-night,
three-day paid trip

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
to a hot spring resort,

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
and the good news is
they're also pet friendly!

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, young lady!

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Heh! Hey, look!
It's a popular hot spring!

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
And Roku will be able
to come, too!

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
[ROKU barks]

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
[HIME giggles]
Isn't that great?

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
Whoa, where the heck did
this fire come from?

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm gonna finish issue
seven before the new year.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
So, no more slacking off, it's
time to complete what I started!

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
Dang, I'm impressed, boss!
You really can do it if you try!

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I've received the manuscript

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
for issue seven safe and sound.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I had made
plans to go to Hawaii,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
so I don't know what
I would have done

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't
been able to finish.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
Hawaii?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I made reservations
like, three months ago,

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
so I was getting pretty nervous.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hold up.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
I never told you I was going
to finish issue seven.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I just thought you would.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You just thought?

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
You should've told me
your plans earlier!

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] But if I'd told you,
you'd probably not finish

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
the issue early on purpose
to be mean or something.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
I'm not that rotten
of a human being!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
Sure...

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
Ugh, whatever. If I'd
known there's a chance

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
my motivation would
have gone down

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't have been
able to draw. Maybe.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It doesn't matter.
I'm going on vacation, too.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Oh? That should be fun.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
So... Where are you vacationing?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
In Izu.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
Izu? How exciting!
I mean... It's no Hawaii, but...

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
Aha, and there you have it!
Why I'd have no motivation!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. How would
Hawaii affect you?

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Manga artists
have to work their tails off

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
for their measly two-night,
three-day vacations.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, you guys get to
jet set overseas for a week!

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
There's no reason you can't go,

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
your manuscript's done,
and you have the time off.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
That's a nice wish!

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
Like a manga artist could ever
go on a vacation that far away!

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
Manuscripts might not
get turned in on time

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
because of some kind of trouble!

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
And even if we get the thing
done before the end of the year,

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
we might have to fix
something during proofs.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
Which means we'd have to come
back from vacation early!

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
True. Especially when
there's toilet humor.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And that's why
our trips have to be cheap,

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
close, and short!

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
Manga artists who go overseas

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
during the New Year's holiday
are total jerk wads!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
But when it comes to
the New Year's holiday,

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
there's a bigger reason
why we can't make plans.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
An important one.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
It's because...

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Because what?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's because no matter
what, we always get sick.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
Man, that sucks.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
But they do say people get
a year's worth of sickness

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
on their vacation.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
He can't pile on
many manuscripts,

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
but boy he can
pile on the germs.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
I wish he could have waited
until after the office party.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
I understand why
my assistants are here.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
But what about you three?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
I just wanted to check on you.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy? How are you feeling?

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
Think you can at least
stomach some food?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't worry. The chief
just has a slight cold.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
The director will feel
better before you know it.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
Can you guys pick a title?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine, Hime. I'll make a
full recovery before our trip.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
Oh, what trip?

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I won a trip in a lottery.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
Ahh, that's what it was about.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Cool! Sounds fun!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
No way, and you get
all you can eat crab?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
We do?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she won that trip

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
because she wrote "crab"
so many times.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Eh?

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
I guess prayers
really can work.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kind of like
the Law of Attraction thing.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Um, maybe?

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, why don't we
all try writing a new prayer?

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
One to help your dad get better?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kanji
we should write.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Here's what we do.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN]
Huh?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
We should transcribe
some sutras.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I'm coming in. Sorry I'm late.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
I stopped by the editing
department before coming by.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Whoa! Why are
so many of his friends

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
and family gathered here?

[CUSTOMER C] I'm just so
relieved you finally know.

All puppies are adorable,

Yeah, amen to that.
Stop breed discrimination.

all on the subject,

That's okay, dear.

How about it, everyone?

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect opportunity
to make yourselves

When I say I'm going to work,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
I'm actually just loitering at
the park for most of the day!

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
I'm even worse!

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
I'm just an irresponsible
schmuck who's been using funds

from the government
to stay at this inn!

I haven't told anyone this,

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center

Izu Highland beef

Truth is, it's just normal beef

[KAKUSHI, RASUNA gasp]

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
It's the ghost of Mr. Tanabata.
He appears every night and is

supposedly working on
the book he never finished.

Yeah, not funny.

Found it. "Yasunari Tanabata."

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Coughed up blood as he
was writing at an inn.

double suicides.

Jeez, old-timey bungos sure
were dramatic and eccentric.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
True, but you gotta admit
that a small dose of crazy

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
really helps a book fly off
the shelf come publishing time.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
Well, let me go cough
up some blood,

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll be more popular.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
If an artist who writes
dirty jokes coughed up blood,

they'd just get
laughed to death.

Wow, harsh.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Let's be real,
something as serious as that

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
would never be beneficial
to a gag manga artist.

trying to build people's
image of you through

naked photos was probably
some kind of camouflage.

Oh, but I suppose that I could
be wrong. I just can't imagine

you'd do something so
stupid for another reason.

looks untouched.

If there's a bungo ghost here,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
maybe he'll possess me

a more popular manga artist.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center

Just for a bit.

be up at this hour.

[BOY C] You dummy. I told you,
ghosts aren't real.

of eye witnesses.

post it online,

[BOYS screaming]

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Daddy, didja know there
was a ghost here after dark?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
You heard that?

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
Yep. Things got pretty
crazy last night.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you're not
afraid of ghosts, Hime?

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
No, I am. They scare me a lot.
Still though...

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
I'm happy they're around.
I think it's for the best.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
And when you think about it,

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
there are probably
a lot of them.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes sense.
There are a lot of people here,

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
and if they all become
ghosts when they die,

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
I guess the Earth
would be overflowing.

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
[HIME] And that's why they're
all invisible and humans

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
can walk right through
them, like air.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
There must be a reason
why we can't touch them.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Look, it's the inn
from the other day.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
So there really was a ghost.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's super scary.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't have much of
a presence for being a bungo.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
I know, right?

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Whenever something bad
happened to my father or

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
he was anxious, he had a habit
of coming in from the veranda.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
That day, when he came home,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
he tried to make sure
I wouldn't worry.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
He said he'd leveled up,
that he'd been recruited.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
He seemed really excited
about his new position.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
But in my heart,

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
I knew he had quit his job,
and that something was off.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
I guess the job
he quit back then

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
was drawing manga for a living.

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
I wonder why he quit though.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] It said in a book
that he quit because he

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
just wasn't popular anymore.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
Oh come on,
you know that's not true.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
I know he willingly
put down the pen.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
When you say it like that,
it almost sounds cool.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
The truth was he
couldn't draw anymore.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
He was afraid that he
was no longer able

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
to make his readers laugh.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
And I think deep down

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
he felt he was hiding
things from his fans.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.778 position:50% align:center
Hey, there's no reason
to even bring that up.

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair. He didn't
do anything wrong.

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Yes. But there are
still plenty of readers

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
who can't separate the
artist from their work.

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
Having your tragic private life
revealed to the public

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50% align:center
is a pretty fatal blow
to a gag manga artist.
