00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.355 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Listen, Hime.
This is a serious matter.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.066 position:50% align:center
Owning a pet is a huge
responsibility.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
I understand. I've read
a bunch of books on it,

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
and I've memorized
the dos and don'ts.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50% align:center
The Ten Commandments,
but for doggies.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
The Ten Commandments?

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.540 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Mm-hm! "I'll only live
for about ten years,

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
so please stay by my side
as much as you can."

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping, sobbing]

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.437 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sobbing]

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.940 position:50% align:center
Do I really wanna know
why he's crying?

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.316 position:50% align:center
[AMI] I think it has
something to do with

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.193 position:50% align:center
the Ten Commandments for Dogs.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
I've heard about that.
Let's see, as I recall,

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
it's the ten promises owners
make to their canine pals.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] "Please talk to me
every day. Even if I don't

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.205 position:50% align:center
understand exactly what
it is you're saying,

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.959 position:50% align:center
I still love hearing your
voice as often as I can."

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.087 position:50% align:center
Of course that stuff
would make me cry!

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.839 position:50% align:center
Are you getting a puppy?

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
Possibly. Hime really wants one.

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:57.094 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What? Hooray!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.096 position:50% align:center
Why are you two celebrating?

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.265 position:50% align:center
Because Hime will be away
at school all day,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
so you'll have to bring
the dog to the studio!

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can't leave a
furball at home all by itself.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.522 position:50% align:center
Huh. I guess you guys
have a point.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.108 position:50% align:center
Could I bring it
to work with me?

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.403 position:50% align:center
If you do this, then
you'd better stick with it.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
You gotta take care of it
to the very end. Ride or die.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.119 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah, that was the plan.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
When I think about it,

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
I guess getting a dog and
starting a new series

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.124 position:50% align:center
are pretty similar.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Huh?

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
At first, it's fun.

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
But eventually you want to
abandon it. And then...

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.883 position:50% align:center
It feels like the ending
will never come.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.429 position:50% align:center
Once you've committed to a new
series, there's no going back.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.265 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
And that's why I think...

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.435 position:50% align:center
...nothing incomplete
is ever a masterpiece!

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Even if it is popular,
a manga series

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:51.273 position:50% align:center
that gets left hanging is
nothing more than garbage!

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.275 position:50% align:center
Seems a little harsh.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
take a look at me.

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to have completed
five whole series.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.284 position:50% align:center
Yes, but as I recall, three
of those were pretty short.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.620 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
They're done, so they count!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.750 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Manga artists only
last about ten years.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.045 position:50% align:center
So if you can,
take good care of them.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.922 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Do what?

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.050 position:50% align:center
The Ten Commandments.
For artists.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
Please send them fan mail.

00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:21.929 position:50% align:center
They get so anxious when
they don't hear anything,

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
it makes them cry.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.474 position:50% align:center
The pain of brilliance!

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Sounds self-absorbed.

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:29.770 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
So, you gettin' the dog or...?

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh! I'm not sure.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:40.614 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mr. Goto.
Are you taking a break?

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.493 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Miss Ichiko. Hi there.
Is this your dog?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
He's more like a pony,
am I right?

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.247 position:50% align:center
I've had him
since middle school.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.250 position:50% align:center
I begged my parents
to let me get a pooch.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
I spent a lot of time at home
by myself, so it helped

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
to have him. He and I've been
through a lot together.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]
I see.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
Hime's the same. She doesn't
have any siblings, either.

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:09.518 position:50% align:center
Uh? Hi, Daddy, welcome home.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Hime. It'll be your
responsibility.

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
What? Really?

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.652 position:50% align:center
You have to promise that
you'll take good care of it.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.405 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Daddy, I love you!

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. So Hime wants a dog.

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

By the way, who's that?

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:38.547 position:50% align:center
Huh? My little bro.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess you're
not an only child then.

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.720 position:50% align:center
I don't think I ever
said that I was.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA] Get this.
I've heard a few rumors

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
that Miss Ichiko has been
seeing a gentleman.

For real?

For real.

we're talking about.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center

definitely getting duped.

Let's move out, detectives!

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.866 position:50% align:center

that he's not a bad guy!

she's meeting with him
while walking her dog.

So cute!

Look at that.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
That's for sure, and dogs
can teach you a lot.

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.468 position:50% align:center

Buh-bye!

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
When we're walking,
all the little kids

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
want to come up and pet him
'cause he's so fluffy.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI laughs]
Sounds a like a hassle.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:36.939 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hold on. This could
actually be dangerous!

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.899 position:50% align:center
What if that happens to me?

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
A puppy!

aren't you Hime's dad?

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.615 position:50% align:center

[GIRLS giggling, chattering]

somebody else around?

Not that I know of.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.939 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't see anyone here.

[NARRATOR]
When walking a dog,

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
people rarely notice
the owner with it.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
Humans might as well be
invisible in those moments.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.282 position:50% align:center
Most of the time,
people forget about them

They didn't discover me.

And yet I feel insulted.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.292 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hello, I read
that you were looking for

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.253 position:50% align:center

I'm really sorry.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.548 position:50% align:center
But the puppies have
all been claimed.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.886 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I see. Well,
I appreciate your time, anyway.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.849 position:50% align:center

Um, what are you doing?

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.444 position:50% align:center
Training my dog walking skills.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:09.198 position:50% align:center
I'll get super strong!
So it can't pull me.

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:11.909 position:50% align:center
I think that might be
the wrong kind of training.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:15.204 position:50% align:center
If anything, you have to
train the dog not to pull.

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:19.166 position:50% align:center
Okay. Anyway, were you
going to say something?

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.586 position:50% align:center

It's fine.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't be able to take

Huh? Who is it then?

00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:55.192 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] This is Hime's mother
when she was still little.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
And the person who painted
it was her father.

00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] That's Hime's mom
when she was just a girl?

00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center

They're identical.

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
So Hime's grandfather
was an artist?

Does that mea--?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And the dog in this
painting is this one's ancestor.

This guy's a
fourth-generation puppy.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.090 position:50% align:center
So then, he's the descendant
of her mother's dog,

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:21.218 position:50% align:center
and he somehow made
his way to her daughter.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
It's fate. He was destined
to belong to Hime.

but it's a great painting.

00:13:38.694 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
You can see who was whose
assistant based on their style.

00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
The longer you're with your
mentor, the more your art

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:46.827 position:50% align:center
looks like theirs, so you can
tell who someone worked for.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
It's easy to track
in that regard.

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Man. This amateur thinks
he's such a smarty.

00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:53.417 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.794 position:50% align:center
But what I said was
totally true!

00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.296 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.298 position:50% align:center
It's not the assistant's art
who looks like the mentor's,

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
it's the assistant's art itself!

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:04.428 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make any sense!
Unless you're trying to tell me

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
the assistants are the ones
drawing everything?

00:14:06.722 --> 00:14:09.433 position:50% align:center
That's not it. Still though...

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
Their flavor does feel similar.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:12.853 position:50% align:center
Flavors?

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.980 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Think about the steps
involved in the process.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.441 position:50% align:center
Basically about 70%
of what's on the page

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.318 position:50% align:center
becomes the assistants' work.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Meaning,
if they continue drawing

00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
like they're doing their
designated job,

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
it ends up looking a lot
like their mentor's work.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.577 position:50% align:center
Oh. I get it.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.912 position:50% align:center

You seem upset.

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
No! It's not like that.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
You don't need to worry, though.

00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
It's only similar in the
beginning, but then time passes.

00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:39.213 position:50% align:center
And the mentor's art
usually gets worse

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
while their assistant's art
gets better.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, uh-huh. How dare you!

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.011 position:50% align:center

00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center

Well, sometimes
it doesn't matter

if they're your assistant.

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:50.951 position:50% align:center

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.582 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I don't know why
anyone would copy your work.

00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:59.710 position:50% align:center

It's a privilege!

mimic more popular styles!

Yeah, sure. Okay.

they were an

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Not the slightest. However...

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:53.138 position:50% align:center
I might've done it
with them once.

00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] I see, well in that
case you must remember

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.893 position:50% align:center
their face or something
distinct about them!

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.353 position:50% align:center
Their face?

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.939 position:50% align:center
Now that our society
is in the digital age,

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:03.649 position:50% align:center
there were several assistants
who worked from home

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
that I never had the chance
to meet in real life.

00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
Did we meet online?
We could have done it digitally.

00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
I can't believe you!

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh? She's mad?

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.916 position:50% align:center
Oh. So you were talking
about an assistant.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.668 position:50% align:center
Yeah, wasn't it obvious?

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Sure. Um, you know.

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Maybe their art style
resembles yours

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.674 position:50% align:center
because they're
a big fan or something.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
Do you think so?

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.969 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda like how
they say dogs

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
start to look like their owners.
But reversed.

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
The truth is, owners
look like their dogs

00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:37.933 position:50% align:center
because they love them.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
People end up looking like
the thing they love.

00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:45.566 position:50% align:center
It's just like how I love
Scarlett Johansson.

00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
The actress?

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
You look like the thing
you love, huh?

00:17:54.283 --> 00:17:57.411 position:50% align:center
I love you, Daddy!

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.831 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So, will Hime look like me?

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.584 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Arf! Arf, arf!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
[DOG barking]

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.962 position:50% align:center
Um, could you try
to be like Daddy?

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Guess what! I
figured it out! That one artist.

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.720 position:50% align:center
He didn't copy you because
he liked you so much.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:15.971 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh?

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.140 position:50% align:center
I asked a buddy of mine
over at the magazine.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.600 position:50% align:center
And according to him,

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
they asked the artist to try
and mimic your art style.

00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:24.313 position:50% align:center
So it was on an
editor's request.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.857 position:50% align:center
Sounds like that publisher
really knows where it's at.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
They do! Because they
actually meant to say

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:31.737 position:50% align:center
the other guy named
Goto who makes manga.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.157 position:50% align:center
Ah. You mean the dude
who's actually popular.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Turns out they didn't
have time to redraw anything.

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
So they just went with it.

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:42.998 position:50% align:center
Ironically, this new series is
a real hit with the fujoshis.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
Life sure can be
funny sometimes.

00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:46.752 position:50% align:center
The pupil has outdone
the master.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
Like hell he has!

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
Wait, do girls really
like this series?

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.300 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look all
that different to me.

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
Like, only a tiny bit. Hmm...

00:18:57.346 --> 00:19:00.057 position:50% align:center
Why are you making your art look
like theirs all of a sudden?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.767 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Have you no pride?

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.602 position:50% align:center
It happens all the time.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.646 position:50% align:center
If they make an anime version
and the character designs

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.899 position:50% align:center
look cooler there, then
the manga replicates it.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.944 position:50% align:center
Like they say, if the pupil
ends up outdoing the master,

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.363 position:50% align:center
then he must copy the pupil.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] That is the lamest
proverb I've ever heard.

00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] By the way, Satsuki.
Did you find me a new assistant?

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.372 position:50% align:center
I need one ASAP.

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:26.375 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Depends, do you
want them to be good?

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
Because I did ask around
the office a bit.

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:32.381 position:50% align:center
Thing is, they had some
talented assistants,

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
but they would
prefer they didn't

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
come work with you, Mr. Goto.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Is it because of
all the dirty jokes?

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.682 position:50% align:center
Sure, that's always
a possibility.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.392 position:50% align:center
But I think they didn't want
to send them here

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
'cause it'd lower
their chance to debut.

00:19:46.395 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
This is all your fault
for not flourishing!

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't get mad at us!

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.568 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Unlike Fujita Pro, Goto Pro

00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
doesn't have a very
promising lineage

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.947 position:50% align:center
to carry on its
so-called legacy.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I've had enough.

00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
Listen here.
Debut within six months.

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Wait, what?

00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
No! Never mind! I need you,

00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
so can you wait until we get
another good assistant?

00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:13.005 position:50% align:center
Hold on, how are you
supposed to get someone

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
who's good when we
haven't debuted yet?

00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
It's a vicious cycle!
From now on,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.971 position:50% align:center
we'll just say the popular
creators came from my office.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure that's called lying.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.144 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] No matter how
good your mentor is,

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.897 position:50% align:center
whether you debut
or not is up to you.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
[piano playing]

00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
[HIME gasps]
I'm taking piano lessons.

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:38.864 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yeah?

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
Turns out I knew
the perfect person.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.284 position:50% align:center
Ciao, man!

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.452 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about
the casual dress code,

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.621 position:50% align:center
Mario is actually
supes talented.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:48.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, you. Stop it already,
you're making me blush!

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.501 position:50% align:center
Well. That's good.

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:54.755 position:50% align:center
It's our first day, but I
learned a whole song! This one!

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.590 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Don't teach her that! Scram!

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
[MARIO yelps]

00:21:01.053 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I really want to find
Hime a good piano instructor.

00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
Hm? Oh, wow.
Did you make dinner?

00:21:08.227 --> 00:21:10.604 position:50% align:center
Well, Nadila helped
by watching over me.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
But yeah, I did
most of the work.

00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:16.652 position:50% align:center
It's good. It kind of
reminds me of something.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.948 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I followed the recipe.
The one from the box.

00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I guess this is another thing

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.912 position:50% align:center
that's gonna be passed down.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
So good.

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.332 position:50% align:center
Uh, Daddy? That's dog food.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI coughing]

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:40.843 position:50% align:center
Poor Hime. I hope she's okay.

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly,
of course she is.

00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you say that!

00:21:44.513 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
But don't act like tailing her
wasn't your idea, Riko!

00:21:47.558 --> 00:21:49.643 position:50% align:center
Uh. Whatever, Hina.

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:54.857 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Well, now. Are you
girls having a little reunion?

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
How come nobody invited me?

00:21:58.527 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
Whoa. Is that Miss Ichiko?

00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
You're...

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.576 position:50% align:center
Not in a tracksuit?

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
I'm aware!

00:22:08.537 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
I have some good news,

00:22:10.122 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
and unfortunately,
some bad news.

[RIKO gasps]

00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's no use! I can't
surpass the rough draft!

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.640 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] In that case,
why don't we just publish

00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:53.725 position:50% align:center
--the rough draft instead?
--[GROUP] What?

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:56.019 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I will surpass it!
Whatever the vision was!

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:57.020 position:50% align:center
With Hime!
