[HIME]
This house, with the same layout

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.776 position:50% align:center
as our home in Nakameguro,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
had even more boxes.

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.532 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Oddly enough,

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:35.369 position:50% align:center
they looked a lot like the boxes
that my mother left for me.

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
There was a number on the front.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.210 position:50% align:center
Inside each container
was a variety of items.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:47.673 position:50% align:center
Things my mother thought I
would need around that age.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.092 position:50% align:center
There was only one
small problem.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.970 position:50% align:center
The boxes had been
filled years before.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
So some of the contents
weren't in style anymore.

00:00:56.849 --> 00:01:00.269 position:50% align:center
But in a way,
those little details

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.938 position:50% align:center
only made me feel
closer to my mother.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
Which made the boxes
even more precious.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
To think that there were
new things to discover here...

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.666 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Kazushi Goto?

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.960 position:50% align:center
Is your real name Kazushi?

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.212 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
Kakushi's a penname?

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's switched.
My real name is Kakushi Goto.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.801 position:50% align:center
Kazushi is what I
go by in public.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
But why use a fake name?

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
It's because I debuted
using my real name.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.225 position:50% align:center
And since it's so unusual...

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Kakushi Goto, huh?
Like the manga artist?!

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
...I had no choice but to
change it for Hime's sake!

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.276 position:50% align:center
That's why I use Kazushi
for all of my useless

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
membership and rewards cards.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
Yeah, naturally.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Have you guys
come up with pennames?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.414 position:50% align:center
You should think of
some before you debut.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.876 position:50% align:center
Hm? Wait. Does that mean
you already have one?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.586 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's possible.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.713 position:50% align:center
But you punks
haven't even debuted yet!

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
Why are you mad, you're the one
who said to have one ready!

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.594 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Mm... What is it?

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:39.970 position:50% align:center
I'm not telling.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, spill it!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
It's a secret, okay?

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
Just tell me--

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
Ask me one more time
and you die.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.562 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI whimpers]

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Never be too nosy
when it comes to a penname.

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm? Hey, what are you up to?

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.321 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
Um. Do you have a problem
with your name or something?

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
No, not even a little.
I love my name.

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.207 position:50% align:center
Besides, other people
like it, too!

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.334 position:50% align:center
So, then... What are you doing?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:14.046 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Fortune telling using
names. "Onomancy,"

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.507 position:50% align:center
It's actually really popular.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Mm...

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
I don't think the number
of brush strokes

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.929 position:50% align:center
in our last name is very lucky.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe you could
take a look at my name.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.892 position:50% align:center
I already did it.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.353 position:50% align:center
Your overall luck
was five stars.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
Your wealth luck was five stars.

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
Your love luck was five stars.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.777 position:50% align:center
And your work luck
was five stars.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
Your name actually
has the best number

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.197 position:50% align:center
of brush strokes possible!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.615 position:50% align:center
Lucky me!

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Although, it did say
that creative jobs

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
weren't really your thing.

00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:47.079 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
Too bad. But hey,
it's a good thing

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
you're a businessman, isn't it?

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good thing.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
So this is the name of
one of my friends,

00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
would you mind doing his for me?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:05:00.217 position:50% align:center
Kazushi Goto, huh?
That's not good.

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:02.803 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What's it say?

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
[HIME] They're not very
fortunate. I feel bad

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
for your friend. You should
be extra nice to them.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Uh. Okay,
I'll be sure to do that.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] You know, I have to
agree! I love Hime's name.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Not only is it super cute,
but it's easy to read!

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.404 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.822 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's a new naming trend,

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
but lately they've been
really hard to spell.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.827 position:50% align:center
You mean they're
unusual or something?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Yeah, and then if I
accidently say their name wrong,

00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
their parents get angry
and call me to complain.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.876 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Sounds like pretty
standard teacher stuff.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
Know what? I have seen a lot
of kids who are named after

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.297 position:50% align:center
anime and manga
characters, though!

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
Totally. At least we don't have
to worry about your manga.

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:44.428 position:50% align:center
There's no way any of
your character's names

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.180 position:50% align:center
would be used for a child.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.556 position:50% align:center
Right, of course not.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.433 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm so sorry.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
It's fine. And it's
not like you're wrong.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.271 position:50% align:center
[BOY laughing]

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A] Loki! What have I
told you about running off?

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.027 position:50% align:center
Huh. I wonder what it feels like

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.323 position:50% align:center
to have someone name their kid
after one of your characters?

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.909 position:50% align:center
Like that would ever happen.

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:10.287 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Tights! Don't run off like that!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.289 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Someone used it?

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.918 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] There we go, what a
good boy! Aren't you, Tights?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.754 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Um. Your dog
has such an unusual name.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
Not really, doesn't it
look like he's wearing

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
a little pair of doggy tights?

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh, sure. Dog tights.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
[NADILA]
Miss Hime? What are you doing?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.766 position:50% align:center
Fortunetelling.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
Do you have something like that
in your home country, Nadila?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.897 position:50% align:center
We do. Shall I
tell your fortune?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yes, yes, yes! What's it like?

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:42.611 position:50% align:center
In order to know your fortune,
I must pray to the spirits.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.489 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groans]

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.617 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] What's up with
the sad cow sigh? You good?

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.912 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Well, I debuted
with my real name.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.539 position:50% align:center
It's made life hard.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
I see. In that case,
why don't you

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:58.919 position:50% align:center
just start using a penname
from here on out?

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.921 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.673 position:50% align:center
Of course, that's genius!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.675 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Wanna think of one together?

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:05.926 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:10.681 position:50% align:center
What's this supposed to be?

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.850 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
It's Goto's new penname.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
He's going to use that one
starting next week.

00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
How stupid can you be?!

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
Are you saying he can't?

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
But we came up
with such a good one.

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO]
Of course, he can't!

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
Maybe if he was a writer
that hadn't debuted yet.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
An author's name is
basically their brand.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.990 position:50% align:center
It's like a trademark,
if they change it

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.576 position:50% align:center
all of a sudden, their fans
will be super confused.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's like she said.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.997 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Okay, I'll tell him
he can't change it.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.707 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Wait. Hold on.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.833 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.960 position:50% align:center
Was he pretty determined
about this?

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:44.131 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Yes? He said his
name made life kinda hard.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.007 position:50% align:center
[RISA grunts]

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.133 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
What's wrong?

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.259 position:50% align:center
Know what this means?

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.302 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
When you spoke
to Goto earlier,

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.431 position:50% align:center
did he say anything
about a fortune teller?

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Huh? Why do you ask?

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.602 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Because whenever a writer
wants to suddenly change

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.146 position:50% align:center
their name, it's often because
they're being manipulated

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.148 position:50% align:center
by people who claim
to know the future.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I can't say I've
ever seen a fortuneteller

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.197 position:50% align:center
at his office. I can
go by his house, though.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.283 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Is that smoke? Don't tell me!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.453 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Whoa. Who is that?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
Hi there. Uh, what're you doing?

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
Fortunetelling!

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
They were right!

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:29.301 position:50% align:center
[HIME gasps]
A spirit?

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
Look, Nadila!

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:33.222 position:50% align:center
So you've come, Spirit.

00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
She's totally my type!

00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:43.607 position:50% align:center
Hold on. He looks familiar.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
Mister Spirit looks kind of
like the CEO from before.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
CEO, huh?

00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
Would you like me to tell
your fortune, too, CEO?

00:08:51.907 --> 00:08:53.492 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
What'd she say?

00:08:53.575 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
I see, that must be
my true name. CEO.

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO]
This might be a problem.

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Yes.
It wouldn't the first time

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.546 position:50% align:center
a manga artist went crazy
after interacting

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:08.215 position:50% align:center
with some weird psychic
or fortuneteller.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
It begins with a new penname.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
Then their comics
have more dialogue.

00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
They'll start thinning out their
ink with hydrogen water.

00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:16.849 position:50% align:center
And in the end,
some of them start believing

00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
they're a god or
become the leader

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:20.394 position:50% align:center
of their own ridiculous cult.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.229 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I'm back.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.814 position:50% align:center
How did it go?

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.649 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
There was a fortuneteller.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
I knew it!

00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:30.654 position:50% align:center
Oh, but don't worry,
she's not suspicious at all.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.283 position:50% align:center
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
She's not suspicious at all.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] By the way, I've
decided to change my name.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'm CEO!

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
[RISA growls]

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.294 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO]
Did she get to you?

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.171 position:50% align:center
Uh. I already told you.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.548 position:50% align:center
No. She's good, good,
good, good, good...

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
[RISA] That's how someone
who was brainwashed

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:52.426 position:50% align:center
by a fortuneteller would speak.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:56.430 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Good, good, good, good...

00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
So today, Nadila and I saw a
spirit! It was totally awesome!

00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:04.730 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.566 position:50% align:center
To be honest, Nadila seemed
kinda disappointed, though.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.152 position:50% align:center
She said they didn't have
that much of an aura.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Well,
that sounds unfortunate.

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
I guess. But Nadila said
she didn't need help

00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
from the spirit
to see our future.

00:10:17.743 --> 00:10:19.912 position:50% align:center
And you know what she told me?

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.206 position:50% align:center
She thinks we'll both be okay.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
'Cause we have a guardian
spirit watching over us.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.170 position:50% align:center
And that they'll protect us
because they're really strong.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Of course.

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
You know, I never really
believed in spirits.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
But maybe I'll try
believing in that one.

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:49.900 position:50% align:center
Me, too! Since it's so strong,
I asked it for a favor.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
So hopefully in the future

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
it'll keep watching
over the two of us.

00:10:54.196 --> 00:10:57.199 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Aren't you thoughtful?
Thank you.

00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Daddy, I was wondering...
Are you any good at drawing?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:06.500 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um. What makes you ask
that all of a sudden?

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.544 position:50% align:center
I dunno, I was thinking
how I've never seen you

00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:10.212 position:50% align:center
draw before. So...

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Because I've
made it my life's mission

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
to hide it from you.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.218 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Are you bad at it?
Is that why you don't draw?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Mm... I wouldn't
say that I'm bad.

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:24.518 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Wait! Why am I letting
my pride do all the talking?

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
So then, you're pretty good?

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
Well, that's subjective.
I'm probably average.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.694 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I see. I was gonna
ask you to help me

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.531 position:50% align:center
with my drawing assignment,
but... never mind.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grumbles] Well,
I might be able to help you.

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:42.411 position:50% align:center
I'm actually just above average.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.959 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I have a dilemma.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to go do some light
sketching with Hime this Sunday,

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
and I want her to
see how good I am.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
But if I draw too well,
then she'll probably

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.176 position:50% align:center
figure out I'm an artist.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
So what are you gonna draw?

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.556 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I dunno, like city scenery.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.141 position:50% align:center
You for real?

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
No offense, but it's been years
since you've drawn a background.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah? So?

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:13.275 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean
I can't draw backgrounds.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
See?

00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm...

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry,
she won't know.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
She'll think you're an
above-average amateur at best.

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That was just practice.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:26.163 position:50% align:center
This time, it's for real.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.293 position:50% align:center
Wait! Stop worrying
about the backgrounds,

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.170 position:50% align:center
we need you to draw
the characters!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.881 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we have to finish
the manuscript.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:36.924 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.343 position:50% align:center
Wow. This drawing
is way too good!

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:42.304 position:50% align:center
If you're not careful,
she'll think you're a pro!

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
Oh? We can't have that.
She must never know the truth.

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.186 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
So, I was wondering.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:53.190 position:50% align:center
Are you guys planning on
coloring these sketches?

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's the plan.
It won't be anything fancy.

00:12:56.193 --> 00:12:57.945 position:50% align:center
Why, what's the deal?

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Well, I was only asking because

00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:04.326 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you color
anything. Can you?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.079 position:50% align:center
[AMI, AOGU]
Shut up, you idiot!

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:08.580 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:08.664 --> 00:13:13.085 position:50% align:center
They haven't asked me to do
any colored pages in years.

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.837 position:50% align:center
No, don't!

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.921 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Please don't start painting

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.506 position:50% align:center
our black and white manuscript!

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
[AMI] You can't just color
whatever you want!

00:13:34.106 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:13:37.693 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Now that I'm here,

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
I feel like I should
have kept walking.

00:13:41.113 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
All right, let's begin.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
Eh?!

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.581 position:50% align:center
You're Hime's dad!
Well, isn't this a surprise?

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.418 position:50% align:center
[NARU] Oh, once a week
I volunteer to teach

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.837 position:50% align:center
a local art class for children.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Wow, you don't say.

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
Did you sign up today because
you wanted to learn how to draw?

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
It's kind of hard to explain.

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:07.139 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Crap, this is so awkward!

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
[NARU] He's bright red. I wonder
why he's so embarrassed?

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's no way.

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:16.023 position:50% align:center
What if he just joined this art
class as an excuse to see me?

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Look, I can't really
go into all the details.

00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell
Hime about this.

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.614 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.033 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] So uh, you must be
a pretty good artist

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.576 position:50% align:center
if you're teaching a class.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.580 position:50% align:center
[NARU] I mean, I've entered a
few contests here and there.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:34.333 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] She's great!
It can't be helped.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
I've gotta suck up my pride
and take this class.

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.213 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to
keep Hime's respect.

00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:41.757 position:50% align:center
I'm in your care, miss.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.885 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'll try and live
up to your expectations!

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Sketching a plaster bust, eh?

00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:55.646 position:50% align:center
I was really hoping
to color something.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.773 position:50% align:center
Uh. Um, what do you think?

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.525 position:50% align:center
--You're awesome.
--Huh?

00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
Your drawing!
I meant your art.

00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
Wow. You think so?
Thanks a lot.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
But to be honest, I was
kind of hoping to get some

00:15:06.657 --> 00:15:08.784 position:50% align:center
harsher criticism from you.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:11.495 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, you're pretty
good already.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
My only complaint is your art
kinda looks like manga.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
[NARU] He looks like the guy
from <i>Fist of the North Star.</i>

00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Whenever a
manga artist tries to draw

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.926 position:50% align:center
realistically, their art tends
to have a very manga-ish style,

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
no matter how hard they try.

00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Oh! Hi, Mr. Goto.

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh? Oh, hi, Miss Ichiko.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Are you heading home
for the night?

00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:38.397 position:50% align:center
An art class?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.691 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Art cla--?! Uhh...

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.861 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Wait, don't tell me.
Have you been moonlighting?

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.238 position:50% align:center
As a super-secret art teacher?

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.573 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What?

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
Come on, there's no reason
to be bashful about it!

00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
I think it's wonderful!

00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Since you're a professional
manga artist,

00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
I bet you know a ton of
things about art, right?

00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah, except
that manga artists

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.960 position:50% align:center
are rarely experts on
the medium as a whole.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
After all, manga combines
writing and art!

00:16:02.588 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Being able to write and draw
your own stories is so cool!

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.176 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:10.721 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Uh... no.
I'm only drawing manga because

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
I couldn't make it as just
an artist or just a writer.

00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.310 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Even though you're a pro,

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
no helping Hime with her
drawing assignment, okay?

00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:19.980 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh?

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
That's Hime's homework.

00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:23.609 position:50% align:center
I know how much you
like to dote on her,

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
but no funny business.

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:27.446 position:50% align:center
I wasn't planning
to do anything like that.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Good, because
I'd know instantly.

00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:31.575 position:50% align:center
I'll be keeping my eye out.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:32.910 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Crap apples!

00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
I never even thought about
the fact that since I'm

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:35.746 position:50% align:center
a professional manga artist,

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
people might assume
anything she draws

00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
might actually have been
drawn by me instead!

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
In that case, to prove
Hime's innocence,

00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:45.923 position:50% align:center
Miss Ichiko will have
to watch her draw!

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
Um. Are you free this Sunday?

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:52.638 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you to go
to the zoo with me.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Hold up, did I
just hear him right?

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:57.935 position:50% align:center
Because it kind of sounded like
he asked me to go out on a date!

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO hyperventilating]

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Is that a yes or...?

00:17:01.647 --> 00:17:03.607 position:50% align:center
It's yes! Count me in!

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And then, on Sunday...

00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sighs] Spending the day
with my girl. I'm so excited.

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:18.205 position:50% align:center
What do you think I
should sketch, Daddy?

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.333 position:50% align:center
With so many animals
it's hard to decide, huh?

00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:34.096 position:50% align:center
I dunno. I'm having
a hard time choosing.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.640 position:50% align:center
It's fine, just draw
whatever you feel like.

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.392 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
[HIME gasps]
I've got it! Tigers!

00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
This is a pretty unusual date.

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
He asked me to watch
from a distance

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
so no one would notice us.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
But I guess it'd look
bad if someone saw me

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.247 position:50% align:center
on a date with one of
my students' fathers.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.957 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I hope she's still watching us!

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.253 position:50% align:center
She needs to know
Hime's not cheating.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
How lovely, sharing
this meal with you.

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.008 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Look, it's our teacher!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, it's you girls.
Why are you here?

00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
We thought this would
be a good place

00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:17.264 position:50% align:center
to do the drawing assignment.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:19.558 position:50% align:center
Isn't it kinda weird

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
to be visiting the zoo
all by yourself?

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
No! And I am not
here all by myself.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
I happen to be on a date!

00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Oh, like a "self-care" date!

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
No, like, "with another
person" date!

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:31.737 position:50% align:center
Okay, so where are they, then?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.323 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Um, well, you know.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
They're just...
far away at the moment.

00:18:41.205 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
[HINA, SILVIA]
They're far away?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
How insensitive of us.

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we didn't mean to be rude.

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA, HINA]
We're sorry!

00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:50.172 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Hey!

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Our teacher's significant
other must've died!

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.342 position:50% align:center
How terrible!

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA] She must be in
a complete state of shock

00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
after losing them!

00:18:56.929 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
[HINA, SILVIA] And that's why
she's on a date by herself!

00:19:01.058 --> 00:19:04.353 position:50% align:center
Make sure to observe it
carefully as you draw okay?

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going
to draw anything?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.775 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, of course,
I'm starting right now.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I took her to the zoo because

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
I wasn't confident in
drawing cityscapes.

00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
But I just remembered I'm even
worse at drawing animals.

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:23.497 position:50% align:center
[HIME] The tiger went into
its den. That's too bad.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.792 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll just have
to draw it from memory.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:27.918 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Except that when I do that

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
it looks like a manga tiger.

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:31.839 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I can see its eyes
shining in the dark.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
Do you think that maybe
the tiger can see us, too?

00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that it can.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Too bad
the tiger stayed inside

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
its home the whole time.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I hope you were
watching. Good job!

00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
That was such a lovely date.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.240 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Today was so much fun! Heh!

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.992 position:50% align:center
I feel so bad for her.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
We promise that we'll
start behaving from now on,

00:20:02.286 --> 00:20:04.705 position:50% align:center
so please don't be sad.

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
It's too bad you didn't
get to draw anything.

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm? But I did.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.713 position:50% align:center
You drew it from
your imagination?

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:14.840 position:50% align:center
Nope, I just drew what I saw.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
How, though? It was
inside the whole time.

00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:24.558 position:50% align:center
So I drew what we looked like
from the tiger's perspective.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
This is...

00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:29.438 position:50% align:center
Oh, so you did imagine it.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I didn't. I just drew
what the tiger saw.

00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:39.740 position:50% align:center
What the heck is
wrong with you?

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.158 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Clumsiness?

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.576 position:50% align:center
So what're we going to do?

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.745 position:50% align:center
They're supposed to
go golfing at the zoo.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:48.290 position:50% align:center
But we don't have anyone else
who can draw animals.

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:51.877 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I have an idea.

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.214 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
We can draw a zoo

00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
without having to
draw any animals.

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:59.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
Just draw from
their point of view.

00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
You can tell he's a veteran.

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:04.306 position:50% align:center
Way to think outside the box!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.226 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
For example...

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.228 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Fire!

00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.771 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
Monster!

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Finding a work around
for hard-to-draw things

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
is what makes you a pro!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.070 position:50% align:center
This kind of reminds me
of a low-budget movie.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:23.909 position:50% align:center
Um. It's embarrassing
to have it on display.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
You think so? It's a
really good drawing.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
I even splurged a little bit
and bought the most

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
decorative frame the store
had in stock today.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.919 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't match
the rest of the room.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:37.631 position:50% align:center
What's strange is that your
drawing looks kind of

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
familiar to me.

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:51.854 position:50% align:center

Look, a tiger!

[KAKUSHI laughs]

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That's right.

00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:00.821 position:50% align:center
The three of us went and
had our picture taken

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:03.115 position:50% align:center
in front of the tiger pen.

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:11.874 position:50% align:center
I wonder if...

00:22:11.957 --> 00:22:14.585 position:50% align:center
...that drawing was from
her perspective.

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.513 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hold up, I can't just
stay at some random hotel

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:50.722 position:50% align:center
and spend the
whole night drawing!
