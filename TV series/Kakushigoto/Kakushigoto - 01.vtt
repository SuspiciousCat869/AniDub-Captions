Why do you hate me?!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I don't!
I wore this to make you happy!

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'd put on this
embarrassing shirt otherwise.

[NARRATOR] When T-shirts
are made as giveaway prizes,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
the most common request creators
have it that they're "wearable."

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
This comes
from the assumption that

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
if a character's face is
plastered all over the shirt,

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
then people won't
wear it in public.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
So you'll often see text,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
or perhaps a
character's silhouette,

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
or if you look real close,
dots that are faces.

tell what manga

What? Seriously?!

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, a girl at school
asked me about your job today.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
I told her that you
definitely had one.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
True, and it's not like

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
we're flat broke or anything.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
What's flat broke mean?

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
Is it like having no money?

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
But if you broke something,

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
then it means it
doesn't work anymore.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center
So broke has two
meanings, I guess.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.304 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Now, dear viewer,
you might be wondering

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
what that even means.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
After a creator has
finished a popular series,

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
then they're usually permitted
to do whatever they want

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
for their next one.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, they often
get too complacent

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
and end up failing,
hence the phrasing.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Wow, Satsuki looks
like he's on a mission.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Listen, it's my job to make sure

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
you don't get to
draw what you want.

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I don't want to draw it.

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
All good, then.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Waugh!

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm back!

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Sorry I was gone for so long.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
But boy did I have a ton of fun.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
How was the reunion thingy?

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
A total blast.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
So, Rasuna, I heard
that you're an assistant

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
on a weekly manga series?

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
Cool, is it one
that I've heard of?

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND 1C]
Ooh!

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] They all made such
a huge fuss over me!

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
It was like I'd already
risen to the top, you know?

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
So what? A couple of
your friends fawned over you

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
and now you think
you're important?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Not shocked
they'd get the wrong idea.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
People think fame
equals importance.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gulps]
Which means...

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
If I want to make
Hime's desire for me

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
to become important a reality...

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
...then I need to become famous!

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Maybe take a second
to think this through?

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
If you become famous, then Hime
will find out your secret.

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
--[KAKUSHI] Huh?
--[GROUP groans]

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
[AMI] You'd just become
an egomaniac anyway.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sobs]

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[AMI] I really think you
should go the mango route.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
--[KAKUSHI] Um...
--[FUJITA] Mango?!

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
I feel like I don't
want that, either.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
This is a drawing
of the cat rescuer!

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
Since I love kitties more than
anything else in the world,

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
I wanna go find and this
nameless hero and thank him!

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[RIKO] Sounds like we need
to create a detective agency!

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Excellent idea!

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Then we'll catch bad guys!

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
He's not a bad guy, though.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
Ee-hee-hee!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Eh-heh!

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
[RIKO]
Mm-hmm!

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hmm?

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] This is literally
"elementary" my dears.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
[RIKO] According to
eye witness reports,

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
our target went up the hill
and then disappeared.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Okay, then we'll
search the hilltop!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter, Hime?

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
Daddy said there are mean
monsters named Fancypeeps

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
who live there,
so I have to stay away.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Wait? Monsters?

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
But everyone knows
that monsters aren't real!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Hey, girls, what's wrong?

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
Get this!

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Fancypeeps?

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
Well, they're no joke, a
formidable enemy to be sure.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
[HINA, RIKO, SILVIA]
They are?

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Fancypeeps lurk in bookstores

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
that don't sell manga.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
They order strange drinks that
sound like magic spells.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
Trust me, those monsters
put me through hell, girls.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
Should we still... go there?

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
[MARIO] Oh? You're back
earlier than usual.

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
You done for the day?

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
No, I'm taking a break.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, your shop
is empty as always.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
It's not.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
If anything,
business is booming.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
--[KAKUSHI] Wha--?
--[AMI] Huh?

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
[AMI] So do you have an office
up here because you're secretly

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
a bougie hipster or whatever?

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
You joke.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] There may be a lot
of Fancypeeps that live here.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
But fortunately, they only
care about themselves.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
And you must like that
because they leave you alone.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Plus, most of the
bookstores don't have manga,

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
so they're easier to visit.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center

Hmm.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
I'm really scared
of Fancypeeps...

[RIKO] Don't worry!
I'm gonna protect you guys!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
[HINA] I wonder. Why would
the cat hero even be up here?

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
Since he's a hero,
maybe he fights off monsters.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Ooh! Look, I found manga!

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Can you just try
and stay focused?

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center

could be hiding out anywhere!

because it's either

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center

a compliment!

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hmm!

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sighs]

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hime?

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hmm?

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
D'ya remember how
you wished for me

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
to be important someday?

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
Was there a reason?

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
Oh. That?

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
Because I thought it
would make you happy, Daddy!

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Wait. Did it not?

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
I am pretty happy.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
But, the thing that would
make me the happiest...

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] The thing that
makes me the happiest.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
Is to watch you.

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
To see you grow up
big and happy.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
Grow up big and happy?

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
Then I'd better
drink lots of milk!

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
Same here!

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
You and I could both use some
calcium so we can be strong.

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Dude, for real?
A company trip to the ocean.

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.306 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Stranger Danger!

00:23:51.389 --> 00:23:53.475 position:50% align:center
[AMI] We did it in time
because we made gyoza!

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:55.060 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're such an amateur!

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.936 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I wanna draw, too!
