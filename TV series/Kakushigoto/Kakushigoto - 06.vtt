[KAKUSHI]
They sent another one this year?

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
The note said that
it's from Naoto Date.

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.655 position:50% align:center
But you already
have the backpack

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.532 position:50% align:center
I bought for you, sweetie.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.660 position:50% align:center
I know. And obviously
yours is the best.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:38.497 position:50% align:center
Still, I felt kind of guilty.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.249 position:50% align:center
So I wore them both.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.836 position:50% align:center
Well, you're a very
thoughtful person, Hime.

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:45.921 position:50% align:center
Okay, you know the drill,
it's time to go ahead

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.798 position:50% align:center
and get our yearly
picture with it.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.384 position:50% align:center
Then we'll put it away so
it doesn't get damaged.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.429 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
We have a lot.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.932 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah, we could
open up our own shop.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.237 position:50% align:center
Naoto Date strikes again.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
Uh, Naoto who now?

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.199 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Every single year
they have the nerve

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
to send Hime a backpack.

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.786 position:50% align:center
Oh wait, you're talking
about that celebrity

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.621 position:50% align:center
who gives backpacks to orphans.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:46.542 position:50% align:center
So, why would they send one
to Hime, are you guys poor?

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.669 position:50% align:center
You need to learn
when to shut up.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
Or else you'll get into
more trouble, fool!

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:54.675 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU screams]

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
How lively.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.805 position:50% align:center
Stupid Naoto Date.
Going and inspiring people.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.223 position:50% align:center
Thanks to him,
now there's a bunch

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
of copycat donators out there!

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.728 position:50% align:center
I mean, who goes around buying
things for someone else's kid?

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
They want to act like they're
being all charitable,

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
but it's actually a privilege!

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Those strangers don't
deserve the prestige!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.820 position:50% align:center
Traditionally,
their family members

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.989 position:50% align:center
will fight for the honor of
gifting a child a backpack

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.700 position:50% align:center
after receiving their
parent's blessings!

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
So for a stranger to just
do it is unforgivable!

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.704 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
That's why it bugs you?

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:27.666 position:50% align:center
When you explain it that way,
you could probably make bank

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
auctioning off the right to
buy your kid a new backpack.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
I get it, so you're upset
because the person

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
sending the gift to her
is a complete stranger!

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they sure are.
At least to me, anyway.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
How cute.

00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:47.728 position:50% align:center
[DRIVER A] You're in a
good mood today, sir.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
It's funny.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.608 position:50% align:center
I never considered that buying
a backpack was a privilege.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be nice if the
people who bought manga

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
thought about it as an honor,
instead of thinking

00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
that they were doing us
some kind of huge favor?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
--That's it!
--[RASUNA] Huh?

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.620 position:50% align:center
We need a kinder world!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
Uh, I was just kidding
around, I mean,

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
there's no way that such
thoughtful and kind readers

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:09.875 position:50% align:center
could actually exist!

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.876 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You're right.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.294 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.046 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] We can't expect
our readers to be part

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
of this kind world.
Not unless we, the creators,

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.053 position:50% align:center
also intend to be part
of this kind world.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Erase, erase.

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center

erase these pencil marks!

Crosshatch, crosshatch.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:30.771 position:50% align:center
I've been given the privilege

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
to do this super monotonous
crosshatching.

00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] And I've been
given the privilege

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.195 position:50% align:center
to draw this complicated bird's
eye view of this cityscape!

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
Well, gang?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.199 position:50% align:center
How does it feel now that you're
a part of a kinder world?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] It feels great,
we're totally refreshed!

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.245 position:50% align:center
Um, honestly,

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:47.663 position:50% align:center
it kinda sounds like you guys
have been brainwashed.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful!

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
Because we've been given
the unique privilege

00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
to be in a major
weekly magazine!

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.669 position:50% align:center

How right you are!

Hooray...

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I wish they'd
try a little harder.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:00.843 position:50% align:center

letting them publish

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.512 position:50% align:center
in this major weekly magazine.

destroy this kind world?

Don't play dumb!
You should be more grateful!

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
I am, though.

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:19.820 position:50% align:center
And do you want to know
what I'm most thankful for?

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.572 position:50% align:center
That booksellers
across the country

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.282 position:50% align:center
let us sell our magazines.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]
You're right, that is important.

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.288 position:50% align:center
Yep. So, here.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
What are all those?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.585 position:50% align:center
Twenty vendor-specific
bonus illustrations.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
That's a lot.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.174 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Living in this kinder world

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.260 position:50% align:center
might be tougher than I thought.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.555 position:50% align:center
[MOM A] My child absolutely
refuses to listen to me lately.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.182 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same with me.

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.017 position:50% align:center
I wish kids understood
that the adults

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
are the ones in charge,
you know?

00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:56.023 position:50% align:center
Seriously, in my house it's one
big never-ending struggle.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:06:01.028 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Not for me, though.

What's up with him?

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
More than likely, it's
a mental breakdown.

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.758 position:50% align:center
The boss has taken on a
crap ton of work lately.

[NARRATOR]
These past few days...

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. It would be an
honor to draw that for you.

You bet. That's not a problem,
you can count on me!

Just look at this schedule,
it's insane!

Whatever do you mean?

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
It's a privilege

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
Hasn't he been acting
real weird lately?

00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:44.613 position:50% align:center
Agreed, it's like he's
become a corporate slave.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
Except that manga artists
are self-employed.

00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.243 position:50% align:center
So instead of being a boring
corporate slave,

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:50.494 position:50% align:center
he's more like a...

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.080 position:50% align:center
Man-slave! Heh...

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.498 position:50% align:center
I know you think you're
just making up

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.208 position:50% align:center
new words by using
the "man" in manga,

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.835 position:50% align:center
but I feel like I should
tell you that term

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.504 position:50% align:center
already exists and it means
something totally different.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Though she might be
onto something.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.550 position:50% align:center
These days manga artists have
to do a lot more than just

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:08.387 position:50% align:center
draw manga. I mean you gotta
take all kinds of random gigs.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.264 position:50% align:center
Like this autograph signing.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Wait. An autograph
signing? For who now?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
For you, duh.

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
For me? No!

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:18.689 position:50% align:center
I must have agreed to it
without thinking it through,

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
I really am turning
into a man-slave!

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.651 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
I knew the name would catch on.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.236 position:50% align:center
But what if Hime
finds out my job

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
after I've exposed myself to the
public, I've gotta turn it down!

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:29.408 position:50% align:center
It's probably too late
to cancel this.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.702 position:50% align:center
They're already advertising
the event online.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.120 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh?!

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
Crap, and it's on Sunday?
But I already have plans.

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited for Sunday!
I can't wait!

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
Kidzanira, here I come!

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.549 position:50% align:center
Kidzanira?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
It's a popular park
made especially for kids.

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.179 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they get to try out
different kinds of jobs,

00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:53.307 position:50% align:center
but apparently it's tough
to get reservations.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.516 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Gotta run.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.560 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
See you tomorrow.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
It's kind of weird how the boss

00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:02.566 position:50% align:center
has turned into
this gratitude monster.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.443 position:50% align:center
I wonder if something happened.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
It's hard to say.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
Can you stop sending Hime
new backpacks every year?

[OLD MAN exhales]

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.625 position:50% align:center
I'm running out of explanations.

00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
Are you still holding a grudge?

00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Well, that depends, do you want
the truth or a blatant lie?

00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:30.594 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
I'm sure you know how I feel.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.932 position:50% align:center
Especially seeing as you're
a parent, yourself.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.768 position:50% align:center
What if one day, Hime brings
home the man she intends

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.937 position:50% align:center
to marry, but then you find out

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.774 position:50% align:center
he draws a dirty manga
called <i>Balls of Fury.</i>

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.317 position:50% align:center
Would you allow it?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.319 position:50% align:center
Of course, I wouldn't,
are you crazy?!

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.238 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
Exactly. Farewell.

00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:00.082 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
He's right.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:04.378 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't let Hime marry a guy
who draws manga like I do.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.506 position:50% align:center
Never! I would rather die!

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.633 position:50% align:center
I'm a paradox!

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.678 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Who the hell in their right mind

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.929 position:50% align:center
would want the
autograph of the guy

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:17.850 position:50% align:center
who draws <i>Balls of Fury,</i> anyway?

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
He seems to have lost
all of his confidence.

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
So yesterday he was grateful
and today he's depressed?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.108 position:50% align:center
If no one's coming to
this stupid signing,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
then I'd rather play with Hime!

00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
Not how this works, dude.

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:36.577 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Hm? Hm. Actually, you
might be able to do both things.

00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
We'll take good care of her,

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.252 position:50% align:center
so please head over
to the waiting area.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.879 position:50% align:center
Bye, Daddy!

00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
Have fun, sweetie!

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:49.840 position:50% align:center
[HIME giggles]

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I see.
So that's what she meant.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
How in the hell am I
supposed to go to both

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
the autograph signing
and Kidzanira?

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
Usually, the adults have to
wait in a special lounge

00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:03.729 position:50% align:center
while their kid
plays in Kidzanira.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.272 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh?

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
That gives you some time to
sneak away and do the signing.

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:10.611 position:50% align:center
The bookstore that
you'll be signing at

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:13.614 position:50% align:center
is in the exact same building.
How lucky is that?

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] You're right!
Except it's too close!

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
What if my worst
fear comes true?

00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy?

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:23.457 position:50% align:center
Nope, no way, no!
No times a thousand!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you'll have
us there to support you.

00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
This is the only way to
make both things work.

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.631 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
Over here!

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
Are you going to be able to
sign people's autographs

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.303 position:50% align:center
while wearing those dad duds?

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:40.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, these? No, I think
I'm gonna change.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.771 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] The signing's
around that corner.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm bailing!

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.651 position:50% align:center
Why are you freaking
out so much?

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.653 position:50% align:center
Because nobody's
even gonna show up!

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
He's having some
self-confidence issues.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:58.492 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't worry, plenty
of people are gonna come.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
Hurry or you'll be late!

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.913 position:50% align:center
No, I don't wanna, let me go!

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.083 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.793 position:50% align:center
That's a huge line!

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
See? It's like I told you.

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:13.215 position:50% align:center
Lots of people came
to the event.

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:16.510 position:50% align:center
[MORIDO-KUN]
Mori.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
It's an autograph signing...

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
...for a dumb mascot.

00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:23.267 position:50% align:center
[AOGU, RASUNA grunt]

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.524 position:50% align:center
[HIME] This is harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Why do I have to watch
her play make-believe?

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:36.572 position:50% align:center
Which one of those adorable,
tiny bakers belongs to you?

00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, uh, I'm just
here to watch

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
one of the little girls play,
none of the kids are actually--

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.997 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] I can't just say I'm
watching little girls!

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
That sounds creepy!

00:11:46.582 --> 00:11:49.168 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm just here
to watch my daughter!

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
She's the one with
the straight bangs.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
How sweet, it's just
the two of you today?

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, her mother's
away, you know, at work!

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.260 position:50% align:center
Well, she must have
an interesting job

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.720 position:50% align:center
to work on a Sunday.

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. In fact, my wife's
a flight attendant

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.184 position:50% align:center
and she's working on an
international flight right now.

00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Time to switch.

00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.145 position:50% align:center
But first, a quick huddle!

00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:12.608 position:50% align:center
Just some background
info on Hime's mother.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Yeah right, who would believe
any of this stupid story?

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.738 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello. Who might you be?

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:21.742 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Ex-nay on the ife-way!

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
So, you see. I am her... sister.

00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
I'm 15 years old.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.923 position:50% align:center
I told you. No one's here.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.760 position:50% align:center
It's an hour before we start and
they haven't let anyone in yet.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.345 position:50% align:center
The ones who are
getting autographs

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
are the hundred people who
entered and won a lottery.

00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Those poor fools
probably just entered

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.227 position:50% align:center
for a chance to sell
my autograph online,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
thinking I was some popular
writer, but decided not

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.940 position:50% align:center
to come once they realized
what a giant fraud I am.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.942 position:50% align:center
Look, I understand
you're nervous,

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.861 position:50% align:center
but do you know
who's more nervous?

00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:00.072 position:50% align:center
All the bookstore employees!

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.532 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's not you?

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:04.243 position:50% align:center
The people working here are
doing everything they can

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
to make sure the
authors are happy!

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
If all else fails,
they're prepared

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
to change into their normal
clothes and get in line!

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:13.544 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Why am I not surprised?

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
Right. I know your faces.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:20.259 position:50% align:center
And if I see any of you guys
in my line, I'll cry.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEES] Looks like we have
another pain-in-the-ass author.

00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:36.942 position:50% align:center
[AMI] It's cool how they get
to experience different jobs.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A] So let's go over
everything from the top.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.864 position:50% align:center
Signing sessions are
a battle against time.

00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:43.532 position:50% align:center
If you're going to draw someone,

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.534 position:50% align:center
please limit it
to one character.

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
Also, to hinder scalping,

00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:49.997 position:50% align:center
please include their name
in the autograph.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
We'll begin the signing
momentarily.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.711 position:50% align:center
Go for it, I know everyone's
just paid to be here.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A chuckles nervously]
Okay, you can come in!

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.970 position:50% align:center
Hey, there. I'm a huge
fan of yours.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
You're not even a paid person,
you're someone I know!

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
Which might actually be worse,

00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.018 position:50% align:center
because that means I'm not
worth bribing people over!

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
No, really, I did the lottery
and I won your autograph!

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:15.898 position:50% align:center
It totally made my day!

00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grumbles]
Here.

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:21.862 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks so much, Mr. Goto!

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:27.576 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I've never seen her.
Maybe she's an actual fan?

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:30.579 position:50% align:center
Momo! I'm so glad
you could make it!

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.332 position:50% align:center
For sure, I got really lucky
and won the lottery!

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
You could have just told me.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
I would have gotten you in.

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:38.337 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
But then I'd feel bad.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
All done.

00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:41.215 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
Thank you so much!

00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:42.341 position:50% align:center
Isn't she sweet?

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Momo is a friend of
mine from college,

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
and turns out she's
a big fan of yours.

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.888 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Like I'd believe that.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.181 position:50% align:center
But it's true, though.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.307 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
How pathetic.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
What's the point
of this charade?

00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
No matter what,
I'm just gonna feel useless.

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:56.647 position:50% align:center
On the other hand...

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
Why do they look so happy if
they're being forced to line up?

00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:02.361 position:50% align:center
That's it! They must be...

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
Part-timers!

00:15:03.654 --> 00:15:05.197 position:50% align:center
That's weird,
I'm surprised you could tell

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.491 position:50% align:center
just by looking at us.
Pretty impressive!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I knew it!

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
I'm an aspiring manga artist,

00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:12.663 position:50% align:center
but I work part time
to pay the bills.

00:15:13.622 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
[GUY B]
I love your work, my man.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.626 position:50% align:center
You another part-timer?

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'm a temp.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.212 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
They're not even hiding the fact

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
that they were hired
by a temp agency?

00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:25.634 position:50% align:center
It's tough to find
full-time work right now.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.511 position:50% align:center
How much are they
paying you an hour?

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
Uh. I live in the country,
so it's only about 850 yen.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
Oh, but they help pay
for my transportation.

00:15:35.853 --> 00:15:37.938 position:50% align:center
That's good to know.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.107 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Okay.
That concludes the 50 people

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.943 position:50% align:center
from our morning session,
so you can take a break.

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Listen, Satsuki.

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:46.864 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't hurt to pay these
people a little more

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
for their efforts.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:53.662 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna go grab
a bite to eat with Hime.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hm?

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Guess what, Daddy? I cooked
this cheeseburger all by myself!

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.544 position:50% align:center
That's great, looks like
you're having lots of fun.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.422 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I made sure
that it's all top quality.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
So, what other jobs
have you tried out today?

00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
Um, a baker, a delivery
person, and policewoman.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.433 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I want this
moment to last forever.

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
Hurry it up, would ya?

00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
It's almost time
for you to go back.

00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
This way, hurry!

00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:21.148 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.025 position:50% align:center
C'mon, we don't have
time for sight-seeing!

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:26.570 position:50% align:center
Uh? Is that taking
place in Ueno?

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
You know him?

00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
Sure, he's a master of
Japanese painting.

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
It's like his art speaks to me,
and I really respect that.

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:36.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
So you really think
he's that impressive?

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
I have one of his pieces.
You wanna see it sometime?

00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:45.464 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU chuckles]
You're always full of jokes.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
He's a renowned master painter.

00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
And even though
we're both artists,

00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
he's viewed on a
different level.

00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
We're worlds apart.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.600 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
What took you so long?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.477 position:50% align:center
Why does it even matter?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Can we drop just drop
the façade? It's stupid.

00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
I finally understand
what you said earlier!

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
But I swear none of these
people are paid to be here!

00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:08.904 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm? Prove it.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
I mean, let's be real,
why would the company

00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.783 position:50% align:center
spend money to have
people come stand in line

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:13.909 position:50% align:center
for an artist like you?

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
Artist like me?!

00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:18.622 position:50% align:center
Can you please make up your
mind on whether or not

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
you have any confidence
in your ability?

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Look at all this.

00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:24.920 position:50% align:center
These are letters and presents
we got from your fans.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
A paid actor would
never go that far.

00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:29.258 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] They really do
like your manga.

00:17:31.677 --> 00:17:33.971 position:50% align:center
So have a little confidence.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.807 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A] It's time to begin
the afternoon session.

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, sir!

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:45.566 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's hard to believe, but...

00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:48.402 position:50% align:center
Everyone here really...

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.237 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C gasping]

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.655 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:56.827 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] ...likes my manga
and enjoys reading it.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
And yet, I can't show Hime.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
[DAD A]
Thanks so much.

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
I see you've brought
your son with you,

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
but do you know what
kind of manga I draw?

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
It's kind of dirty.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[DAD A] Of course, I know.
We're big fans of your work.

00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
Look, Daddy! It's Tights!

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.145 position:50% align:center
That's pretty great, huh?

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[SON giggles]
I'm so happy!

00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:28.567 position:50% align:center
And that's why you need to have
a little more confidence.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.612 position:50% align:center
You see? You made that
little boy so happy.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
It's pretty cool. No way could
we pay for that response.

00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:36.909 position:50% align:center
Mostly because
we'd get in trouble

00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:38.577 position:50% align:center
for hiring an underage kid.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:42.039 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:45.584 position:50% align:center
All I'm doing is making
the manga I believe in.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
There he is.

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:50.464 position:50% align:center
Everything is finally right
in our weird world.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] No matter what any
master artist might say...

00:18:53.884 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
My job is to draw... manga!

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:11.068 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
No! She knows!

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groans]

00:19:12.528 --> 00:19:16.198 position:50% align:center
Can you stop hogging the
station! Jeez, it's my turn!

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Wait. What are you doing here?

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.371 position:50% align:center
Me? Just trying out
different jobs!

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
Oh! So this is like
Kidzanira for adults.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, that's right.

00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
I guess grownups get kinda
bored waiting around, too.

00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:32.965 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna go
look for my daddy.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
He didn't show up at the time
we're supposed to meet.

00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
He's probably lost.

00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
Could it be that your
very own daughter

00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:46.645 position:50% align:center
failed to recognize you
because you're dressed

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.522 position:50% align:center
like a gross slob at the moment?

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Who knew that your shabby
manga artist cosplay

00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
would actually pay off?

00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
This isn't a cosplay!

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:58.532 position:50% align:center
So which of the jobs did you
like doing the most today?

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:02.286 position:50% align:center
Uhh... They were all kinda fun.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:08.250 position:50% align:center
But I think the one that I liked
the most was the bookstore job.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Sounds kind of tough.

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.714 position:50% align:center
It wasn't too bad.

00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
For you, Daddy. A present.

00:20:18.177 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where'd you get that?

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.848 position:50% align:center
I used the money I earned today.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.976 position:50% align:center
You earned money?
Wait, at Kidzanira?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.854 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Yep, sure did.
When you work, you get money.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.982 position:50% align:center
It's called "kidza" and you can
use it in the shop there.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:37.988 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hime bought me this
with the money she earned.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.615 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Still though, I bet
that the entrance fee

00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
is probably more expensive.

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:45.913 position:50% align:center
In the end, I guess you're
technically paying them

00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
to let me earn money.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Mm...

00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Interesting.

00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:56.340 position:50% align:center
In a way, it's similar
to being an artist.

00:20:56.423 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
I wonder how much longer
will I be able to do this job?

00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:02.888 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy?

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.933 position:50% align:center
So does the Kidzanira
for grownups

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
let you try all
kinds of jobs, too?

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:09.353 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
It does, right?
Have you ever been there?

00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:16.527 position:50% align:center
Uhh... I might
check it out one day.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:27.246 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
There were even more containers.

00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:30.082 position:50% align:center
But these were different.

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:35.087 position:50% align:center
[HIME] They were prepared
for me by my father.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.841 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:45.222 position:50% align:center
[HIME] It was... an incredibly
mundane manga.

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
There were no swords or magic.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
Nothing exciting at all.

00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
A dad, a mom, and a daughter.

00:21:55.858 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
A story about the three of them
and their normal, boring lives.

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
[HIME] But... that
seemingly boring life...

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:14.585 position:50% align:center
[HIME] ...was everything...
everything I'd ever dreamed of.

00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:50.180 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Nothing incomplete
is ever a masterpiece!

00:23:50.264 --> 00:23:51.723 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
I can't believe you!

00:23:51.807 --> 00:23:53.892 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN] That and
the dog are her inheritance.

00:23:53.976 --> 00:23:56.603 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] That's Hime's mom
when she was just a girl?
