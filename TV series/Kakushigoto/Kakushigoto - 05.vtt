00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
I refuse.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
C'mon, I said please.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.481 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I can't judge
the newcomer's award.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.899 position:50% align:center
Because if I do,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.235 position:50% align:center
then all those amateur artists
are just gonna hate me.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
But all the other pro manga
artists have already done it.

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.531 position:50% align:center
Just think of it as your turn.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't really care if
it's my turn or not! I said no!

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.621 position:50% align:center
Uh. What is that?

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.958 position:50% align:center
It's my white coat.
Y'know, for lunch duty.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.961 position:50% align:center
It's my turn.
So I've gotta be ready.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.840 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grumbles] Don't you
have any duties that you hate?

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I mean, yeah, but who doesn't?

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
Someone has to do the jobs
others don't like,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.930 position:50% align:center
otherwise our society
will crumble.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
That's what my teacher says!

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.854 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, I didn't know
that you were judging

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.522 position:50% align:center
the newcomer's award, boss!

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
Wait, but the other day you said
there was no way you'd do it.

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.652 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I've been in the
industry a long time,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.404 position:50% align:center
so I gotta step up to the plate.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.823 position:50% align:center
Somebody has to do the
jobs others don't like.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.117 position:50% align:center
Otherwise our society
will crumble.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Ahh...

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.260 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] All right, I'm off
to submit the manuscript.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
Let's be real here, are you
even fit to judge this contest?

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
You draw gag manga.

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.516 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm still a pro.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
Would you mind taking a look
at my manuscript, then?

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.688 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate your insight.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.691 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are you saying
you don't just erase stuff?

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
My dream is not pro erasing!

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.116 position:50% align:center
How is it?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.411 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Well, you have a
talent for erasing things.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.288 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Can you please
take this seriously?

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.291 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to know
if this is good or not?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
The initial explanation of
the world is so damn long,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.587 position:50% align:center
I can't get past the beginning!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
That was like actual
constructive criticism.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh. Well, I guess it was.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:42.014 position:50% align:center
Kakeru, your initial explanation
of the world is too long.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.725 position:50% align:center
There's also entirely
too much narration.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.727 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.188 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hold your breath
and read it from the start.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.860 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And there it is.
How far did you get?

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.321 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even finish
the first page.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.573 position:50% align:center
That's about how much
patience your reader has.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.617 position:50% align:center
To the end of their
breath capacity.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.993 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU gasps]

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.161 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] If you don't grab
their attention by then,

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
you've lost them.

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.206 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Damn. Real talk.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.625 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Yeah, he made sense.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
Plus he's spot on.

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:13.587 position:50% align:center
I'm looking at the latest issue
of Jumpo right now,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.339 position:50% align:center
and you can read
an entire chapter

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
while you're still
holding your breath.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
Um, I don't think he meant
it quite that literally.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.595 position:50% align:center
A reader would die
of oxygen deprivation

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
before things ever
got interesting!

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:33.065 position:50% align:center
I can hold my breath for
three whole minutes now!

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
you missed the point.

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:36.360 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[DELIVERY GUY]
Delivery!

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:39.780 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Coming!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
[DELIVERY GUY]
I have a few more.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm back.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.333 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Welcome home, Daddy.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.962 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm? Hime? Hime?

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.213 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Down here!

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps] Hold on,
sweetie, Daddy's coming!

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.677 position:50% align:center
No need to freak out, I'm okay.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What the heck
is all of this? Huh?

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.227 position:50% align:center
I will kill him!

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.937 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I figured if they were
sent to your studio,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.397 position:50% align:center
it'd get in the way
of your work.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
So I sent them to your house.

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.276 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Well, you're an idiot!
What would I do if Hime opened

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
one of them up and
saw what was inside?

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.946 position:50% align:center
Or worse, what if
this crazy amount

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.866 position:50% align:center
of boxes had fallen over
and crushed her?

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.660 position:50% align:center
I know it's a lot, I had
to make all the copies.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.996 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So just send PDF files instead!

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
You mean you know
about PDF files?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.001 position:50% align:center
Of course! Damn it all.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
Look at this crap. What an
insane number of entries.

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm surprised there
are this many new artists.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
Maybe there is hope and
the industry isn't dying.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
There's only one entry per box?
What is this, Amazon?

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:54.605 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
[DELIVERY GUY]
Delivery!

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Satsuki!

00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:07.034 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] What? I sent them to
your studio like you asked.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] No, I asked you
to send the PDF files

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.038 position:50% align:center
to my computer, idiot!

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.874 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?
E-mail the files?

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.751 position:50% align:center
But I went through all that
trouble to send them

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:20.297 position:50% align:center
to the studio! Clarify next
time! I'm not a mind-reader!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.924 position:50% align:center
[dial tone]

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
That guy's useless.
What a complete and utter tool.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Whatever,
might as well get started.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
This one has a lot of girls,
but it's hard to tell them apart

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
since none of them have
distinguishing features.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.357 position:50% align:center
And while the pace
is pretty good,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
is it really worth sacrificing
the flow of the story

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.070 position:50% align:center
for this one dirty joke?

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.489 position:50% align:center
Wait, this totally
describes my art!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
If I say that,

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.368 position:50% align:center
then I'll be labeled as
a big, fat, hypocrite!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
No problem, I'll just
phone it in instead.

00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:56.208 position:50% align:center
I can't! We're talking about
somebody else's life here!

00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:00.379 position:50% align:center
This is their career.
I have to take this seriously!

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groaning]

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.633 position:50% align:center
Holy crap, what broke you?

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's definitely
a lot of pressure.

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:09.847 position:50% align:center
Like, you have the power to make
someone's life better or worse.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.225 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Pretty much.
I know this is a contest,

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.687 position:50% align:center
but I also think of how they're
someone's kids, ya know?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.648 position:50% align:center
If something Hime ever drew
was to get a bad review...

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
I'd be pissed.

00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:24.236 position:50% align:center
So why not imagine
that you're critiquing

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.238 position:50% align:center
something Hime created instead?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:26.989 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
It might help you out.

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
Because then you can
give them some praise,

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
but also critiques
that'll help them grow.

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I see...

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.876 position:50% align:center
Hime would never draw
this kind of filth!

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.296 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But what if she
got it from her father?

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
[AMI panting]

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:47.009 position:50% align:center
This really blows.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.719 position:50% align:center
Why can't we make
glasses be in charge

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
of the stupid grunt work?

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Hm... I can't believe
the comments he wrote

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.027 position:50% align:center
for these entries.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
They're way too
serious for someone

00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
who's a gag manga artist.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:16.997 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] There. Hey, I might
actually be a genius.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.874 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grumbling]

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Check it out, the internet
is ripping you a new one

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:22.753 position:50% align:center
for your comments.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.214 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Yeah. You should have
taken this more seriously.

00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Satsuki!

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
What now?

00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
I didn't write down "LOL"
at the end of my comments!

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
I wrote down
honest-to-goodness critiques!

00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
This isn't remotely funny.
And now I look like a jackass!

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:39.061 position:50% align:center
Wait. You didn't write
the "LOL" part?

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.479 position:50% align:center
It was him!

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.941 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Whoa, for real? The dude
must be a complete tool.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
I didn't even wanna judge this
thing, but you forced me to!

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
So why the hell
would you change it?

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
We all have to do things we
don't want to sometimes.

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
We're in the same position.

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
What unwanted duty was
forced onto you?

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.203 position:50% align:center
It's Goto Duty.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
You heard me, everyone at the
office considers you a duty!

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
They do?

00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR A] Man, I don't
wanna be on Goto Duty.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR B] Someone has to
do the jobs others don't like,

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center
otherwise the business
will crumble.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.092 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR A]
'Kay, then you do it.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.552 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR B]
Hard pass.

00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:13.804 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR C] Can't we give him
back to his old publisher?

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.639 position:50% align:center
Are you saying everyone
hates me so much

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.975 position:50% align:center
that I'm basically
an undesirable duty?

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.561 position:50% align:center
You have a lot
of rules to follow.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center
Hey, Daddy. Do you have
assigned duties at work?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
What? I guess.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.656 position:50% align:center
But there's only one job
I really care about.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
And that's raising you
with the utmost care.

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:38.704 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,
someone had to raise me.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.957 position:50% align:center
And one day, you'll raise
someone you love.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And I hope I get
to do that soon!

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Well, you don't have to
rush it or anything!

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.715 position:50% align:center
It's fine if you wanna
wait 20 years or so!

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:50.966 position:50% align:center
I could do it now.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Eh?

00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
See? With a puppy.

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:58.015 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Ohh. You'll have
to study a lot about them.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.143 position:50% align:center
That's really important to do
when you're raising somebody.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.146 position:50% align:center
So, then, did you study
for me, Daddy?

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.564 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:13.155 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And I'm still learning
new things every day.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.742 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Great work today.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
I'm finally done.

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
I think I might stop by
the store on the way home.

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:27.878 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I finished up work early,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.506 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd bring you
your favorite candy.

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh... Thanks, Daddy!

00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
I love these because
they're super yummy.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.763 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I noticed you
eat them all the time.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.891 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hello?

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:46.313 position:50% align:center
Huh? Right.
I'm so sorry sweetie,

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
but it looks like I have to take
care of something at work.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.485 position:50% align:center
Life's rough when you're
a boring old businessman!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.909 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] 'Kay, I'm here.
What's the big emergency?

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
Oh, your proofs
didn't get approved.

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:11:01.954 --> 00:11:03.247 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Calm down.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.332 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Proofs or
proofreading is the final check

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
conducted by the editorial
department.

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:09.920 position:50% align:center
They go through the content and
how things are expressed.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
Occasionally, they may
ask for revisions.

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:14.550 position:50% align:center
This happens a lot
with toilet humor.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
Like you would know!

00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
We reviewed it.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
Everything will work out fine if
you redraw the last eight pages.

00:11:20.973 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, the deadline is 5AM.

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:25.519 position:50% align:center
Wait like tomorrow? There's
no way I can pull that off.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but that's the
longest the printers can wait.

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Why can't they just
print it when I'm done?

00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
Because the times have changed.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Since the number
of manga magazines sales

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.534 position:50% align:center
have gone down, we're no
longer the top customers

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
for the big printing companies.

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
Sucks to be in your industry!

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.957 position:50% align:center
It's your industry, too!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so.

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So then...

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.963 position:50% align:center
What's number one for
printers these days?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.840 position:50% align:center
It's funny you should ask.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:58.969 position:50% align:center
Voila! Snack packaging,
who'd've thunk?

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.847 position:50% align:center
I love these because
they're super yummy.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
I'll be done by five!

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:09.980 position:50% align:center
We've booked you a room
so you can concentrate.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
You're canning me in?

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.860 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I've always wanted
to experience this once.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I've always wanted
to lock him up just once.

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:20.282 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI, SATSUKI]
I'm so freakin' excited!

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Well damn, it doesn't
suck to be in my industry now.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.209 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
I know the manager here and
he gave me the hook up.

00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:34.046 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That checks out.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.173 position:50% align:center
Probably how he
got his job, too.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold up, I can't just
stay in some random hotel

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
and spend the
whole night drawing,

00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
what about Hime? I'm outta here!

00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
But if you draw at home she'll
know you're a manga artist.

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What should I do?

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
Nadila will be there
until six, but then what?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
I'll be too worried to
even think about manga!

00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Nadila?

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.943 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.611 position:50% align:center
--[SATSUKI] No sweat.
--[KAKUSHI] Huh?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
I'll watch over her for you.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.616 position:50% align:center
Just leave everything else to me
and focus on your deadline.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.077 position:50% align:center
For real? You don't mind.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.621 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:11.959 position:50% align:center
Hello, are you there, Aogu?
Pick up. Damn it.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.794 position:50% align:center
No one's answering their phones.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.672 position:50% align:center
I guess I can't blame them
since we just finished.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.261 position:50% align:center
That feels so much better.

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
The hell? Why are you here?

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:26.974 position:50% align:center
Better question...
Why were you taking a shower?

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Satsuki flagged me down
and gave me the room key

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
on my way home, and I'm
showering because yay, freebies!

00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
I even stopped by the office and
picked up our drawing things.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh. Thanks?

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:42.698 position:50% align:center
But there's no way I can draw
in all these stuffy clothes.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.700 position:50% align:center
But you're fine drawing
in a bathrobe?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
It's pretty loose, so yeah.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
Although, to be honest,

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why you're
drawing in a bathrobe.

00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:54.001 position:50% align:center
Well, why not? It makes
me feel super fancy.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
It's strange, though.
With just the two of us here,

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.590 position:50% align:center
it feels sort of like
a secret meeting, huh?

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.176 position:50% align:center
Not funny! What if
the public found out?

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
What if a tabloid published
pictures of us

00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
and everyone thought
we were having a tryst?

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Hime would die of embarrassment!

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:09.141 position:50% align:center
And worse,
her ghost would hate me!

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.728 position:50% align:center
I need a dude! Any dude!
Please send me a dude assistant!

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
Yo, I got your voicemail.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
It's kinda weird you ask me
to come to a hotel, though.

00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:22.029 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.157 position:50% align:center
Thank you for joining me.
I mean it.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.618 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
What the heck is this about?

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.579 position:50% align:center
I want to debut,
but not like this!

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.581 position:50% align:center
I'm not following you.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Stranger Danger!

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
I'm acting super normal!

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Then why do
you look suspicious?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
So you're Mr. Goto's editor?

00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Yes. He asked me
to look after her

00:14:53.227 --> 00:14:55.521 position:50% align:center
since he has to
work late tonight.

00:14:55.604 --> 00:14:59.233 position:50% align:center
I see. Well, good luck,
I suppose.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
[NADILA] Goodnight, Miss Hime.
Until next time.

00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:04.488 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Goodnight Nadila!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I can't lose sight of her.

00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:11.495 position:50% align:center
I have to keep my
promise at all costs.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:18.252 position:50% align:center
You know.
It's kind of lonely here.

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:24.216 position:50% align:center
[TV VOICE] A little girl's ghost
appears out of nowhere.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
She's cursed to haunt people
living all alone.

[HIME squeaks]

00:15:37.813 --> 00:15:40.107 position:50% align:center
Please let me...

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.234 position:50% align:center
...stay with you.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Of course, whatever you need.

00:15:44.403 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
You can even stay
the night if you want.

00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
[NARU] I got in a huge fight
with my parents.

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:53.120 position:50% align:center
But I thought that
fighting was bad.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.873 position:50% align:center
What about you? Why are you
home all by yourself?

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's 'cause Daddy
had to go to work.

00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:01.712 position:50% align:center
You serious?
Dads are such workaholics.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.006 position:50% align:center
Well, now I definitely
have to stay over.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.842 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine
with me here, Hime!

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center

Hey, is this Nadila?

00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:11.138 position:50% align:center
[NADILA]
Oh, what's up, Cool Japan?

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.723 position:50% align:center
Something just came up at work.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
Do you think you'd be able to
stay with Hime until morning?

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[NADILA] Sorry, I can't.
I have another client.

00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:22.191 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Oh, right. I'm sorry
to bother you, then.

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:29.031 position:50% align:center
How strange, I was just talking
about you. Say what?

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
You're canceling?

00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm back, Miss Hime.

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.578 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yay, it's Nadila!

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Nice to meet you!

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:41.627 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm worried. So worried! Man.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.297 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] She's ten now, isn't
she? You need to relax a little.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.342 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] You wouldn't
understand. More importantly,

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.886 position:50% align:center
why in the hell are you also
wearing a bathrobe?!

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.597 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm not gonna be
the only guy not wearing one.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
I would bet you anything
Hime's super sad

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.894 position:50% align:center
and all alone right about now.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.354 position:50% align:center
[HIME, NADILA, NARU]
Yay!

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that today
was your birthday, Naru.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
Though, how old are you--?

00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:07.236 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Wait, you're not supposed
to ask idols about their age!

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
Yeah, how old are you turning?

00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:10.948 position:50% align:center
I'm 17 now.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Oh, it is okay. [gasps]

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.368 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Stare.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.245 position:50% align:center
A guy's looking
through the window!

00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
[NARU, NADILA]
Hm?

00:17:18.247 --> 00:17:19.540 position:50% align:center
There's no one's there.

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:22.793 position:50% align:center
It could only be... my stalker!

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Do you know who it is?

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:26.964 position:50% align:center
No, but I'm an idol and
idols have stalkers, right?

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:27.798 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.386 position:50% align:center
It's a weird package.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
Yeah, probably from
my weird stalker!

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.392 position:50% align:center
Well, it must be some
kind of metal cylinder.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.394 position:50% align:center
You probably shouldn't
pick it up, Nadila!

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
I've actually seen something
similar to this in my country.

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:45.274 position:50% align:center
What's the word again?

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
Oh right, bomb.

00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:48.402 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
What?!

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.570 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS screaming]

00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Girls sure are scream-y.

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
Predator!

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
No, editor.

00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever!

00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.579 position:50% align:center
Why would a manga editor
hang out at his writer's house

00:17:58.662 --> 00:17:59.872 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night?

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
I already told you,
'cause I know his family!

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.586 position:50% align:center
Time to solve this mystery
once and for all.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.171 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Excuse me!

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:11.550 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] I've caught this
predator. Do you guys know him?

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
A stalker?

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
The CEO?

00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.430 position:50% align:center
It's the spirit.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
So which is it?

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.185 position:50% align:center
Um, we could always go
with multi-talented genius?

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Why the heck didn't
anyone call me sooner?

00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:26.607 position:50% align:center
I didn't know there was
a bathrobe party!

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.859 position:50% align:center
This is not a party, it's work!

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.278 position:50% align:center
Still, I see you in a
whole new light now.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.989 position:50% align:center
I never imagined you'd look
so good in a bathrobe.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grumbles]

00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
You're definitely giving me
those Hugh Hefner vibes.

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:39.203 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Was that a compliment?

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Can we just get
back to work, please?

00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Fine...

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:48.587 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's done. We made it in time.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
You guys are having a bathrobe
party and didn't call me?

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
I'm a lot of fun
at these things,

00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you left me out!

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.052 position:50% align:center
Well, the party's over!

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
And there was never
a party to start with!

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
[NARU] I can't believe
we stayed up all night!

00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
[NADILA]
See you later, Miss Hime.

00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:03.769 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] All right predator,
time to move it along.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I prefer
"multi-talented genius."

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:15.322 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hime!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.657 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI panting]

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
Hime!

00:19:17.908 --> 00:19:20.327 position:50% align:center
Daddy? Welcome home. Morning.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.204 position:50% align:center
Hey, why do you look so tired?

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.665 position:50% align:center
I didn't sleep much.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] She must've been so
lonely that she couldn't rest.

00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.965 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Oh yeah, I wanted
to tell you. It's the can.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
[HIME] The legendary can!
It really exists, huh?

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
How do you know?

00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:40.264 position:50% align:center
For one thing, I have proof.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:41.265 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You've got the wrong idea!

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.852 position:50% align:center
I swear it's not what you think!

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.103 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
It's a big can of toys!
I won it from the candy.

00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
Uh, ohhh... So that's why
you were eating so many.

00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
Uh, well I like the
chocolate that's inside, too.

00:19:56.405 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
But now that I've got
a gold tab,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
you don't have to buy
them all the time.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] They're all gone?
She must really like them.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.665 position:50% align:center
That means I need
to buy even more!

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Did you hear me?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
I said you don't have
to buy them ever again.

00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:21.180 position:50% align:center
Hey Daddy, why is the person who
won the silver medal crying?

00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:23.891 position:50% align:center
Is it because her pedestal
is not as high?

00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:25.726 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.187 position:50% align:center
Were you happy when you
got the gold candy tab?

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] But, the silver ones
made you happy too, right?

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah! So she's crying
because she's happy! Oh!

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:43.285 position:50% align:center
I made this at school,
it's for you.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.162 position:50% align:center
For me?

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.206 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
It's gold!

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:49.333 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Thank you.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's a bit cliché,

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:53.921 position:50% align:center
but I love it when she makes me
these kinda things.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
So I have to ask,
what exactly is this for?

00:20:56.632 --> 00:21:00.052 position:50% align:center
Huh? Let's see...
A bunch of stuff!

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.929 position:50% align:center
Basically it's just
my way of saying

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.306 position:50% align:center
you're a gold medal
in my book, Daddy!

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.600 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.310 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
But someday...

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Once Hime falls in
love with someone...

00:21:10.521 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
I'll probably become
her silver medal.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm?

00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
What are you writing, Daddy?

00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
Just a reminder, cause I
don't ever wanna forget

00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:25.077 position:50% align:center
the day I won this
gold medal from you.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] This way, even if
one day I become a silver,

00:21:28.247 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
I'll be okay.

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Never mind,
I always wanna be gold.

00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:36.922 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
But you are gold.

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I found more containers

00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:45.806 position:50% align:center
like the ones my
mother left behind.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
And it made me really happy.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:52.938 position:50% align:center
But... they just seemed...
different somehow.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.118 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I knew it.
It's Dad's handwriting.

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:10.873 position:50% align:center
The person who left these
for me was my father.

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy...

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Kidzanira?

00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:50.848 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] It's a popular
theme park for children.

00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.474 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I'm so excited for Sunday.

00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:54.810 position:50% align:center
[AMI] This wouldn't
even work in manga!

00:23:54.893 --> 00:23:56.937 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Curse you, man slave!
