00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:21.647 position:50% align:center
Time for a family meeting.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.483 position:50% align:center
A family meeting?

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yep.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
All right. But uh, our house
doesn't have a meeting room,

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:32.908 position:50% align:center
so we should wait until
we can make one. 'Kay?

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
That's fine.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI sighs]

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] A family meeting?
But there's only two of us!

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.086 position:50% align:center
So wouldn't it be more of
a conversation? Or...?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.797 position:50% align:center
Maybe a casual chat?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.841 position:50% align:center
What if it's something serious
and Hime freezes up

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:53.804 position:50% align:center
in the middle of it?
What should I do?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.265 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI groans]
What should I do?

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.392 position:50% align:center
We have an editors'
meeting next week.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.186 position:50% align:center
Thinking up a serial for
a new artist is so stupid

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
and annoying. Plus, it's not
even the editor's job!

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:07.860 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI, KAKUSHI sigh]

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI, KAKUSHI]
A meeting, huh?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
I'm worried. Like, what's
this meeting even about?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.461 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Direction
for the future, maybe?

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:51.547 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So, educational policies?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That stuff's important.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.259 position:50% align:center
It's possible things
won't work out.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.387 position:50% align:center
In which case there could be a
complete change in direction.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.638 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I don't get it,

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
why don't they just do a
sequel to their old hit?

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
I suppose. So then...

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.645 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it's about
something else?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.523 position:50% align:center
You know, like whether to have
rice or bread for breakfast.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.816 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
No way. I doubt it's
anything like that.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
It's important to stay healthy,
but that's not meeting worthy.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
C'mon, we're not dealing
with kids here.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.867 position:50% align:center
Aren't we, though?

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't call someone a child
to belittle them, Goto.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
That's how feelings get hurt.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.875 position:50% align:center
Stop treating me like
a little kid, Daddy!

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
It would be much fairer to
treat each other as equals.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.130 position:50% align:center
I was in the wrong.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
You're so agreeable today.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.593 position:50% align:center
On that note, if I want to
treat someone like an equal,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.970 position:50% align:center
I should talk to them about
their spinach intake.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
True. Communication
needs panache.

00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:46.560 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]
Meetings sure are rough.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.145 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
I think meetings are only
hard because they're always

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
so darn formal. Why can't they
be a casual chat instead?

00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah, and it's
probably not even important,

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.739 position:50% align:center
it's just a meeting for the
sake of having a meeting.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
Meeting time!

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the staff meeting!

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.869 position:50% align:center
Editor's meeting, now!

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI, ICHIKO]
Probably.

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.206 position:50% align:center
It's also possible they
wanna have a meeting

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
because they prefer to
communicate in person.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.169 position:50% align:center
That does change your
perspective on things.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.504 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yeah...

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Wow.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
To think they care so much
about my family meeting.

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
There are good people
in the world.

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:23.347 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] To think they care so
much about my editors' meeting.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
There are good people
in the world.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:28.602 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] To think they care so
much about my staff meeting.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
There are good people
in the world.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.523 position:50% align:center
But seriously.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
I really wish we didn't have
to deal with silly meetings.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah, same here.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way. What,
uh... What is this thing?

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.909 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It looks like an old well.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.619 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
It is.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I'm heading out.

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Be careful.

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Oh, yeah. The meeting
room, is it ready yet?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.090 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.675 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
No way!

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50% align:center
Part of me just thought she was
joking about the meeting thing!

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
So I'm curious, what did
you wanna talk about?

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
The meeting's about
a birthday party.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.394 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
For real, a birthday party?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.104 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Spoiler alert,
there aren't many houses

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
that actually have
meeting rooms.

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.818 position:50% align:center
We definitely don't have one,
that's for sure.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
Guys, it's not a big deal,

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
you can have a meeting
without a meeting room.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Are you serious?
So then all those businesses

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
just waste those rooms
for no reason?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.953 position:50% align:center
Then, can you have
them anywhere?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:31.582 position:50% align:center
Indeed! Remember the old
phrase, "Well-side gossip"?

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.543 position:50% align:center
We just have to find a well and
you can have your meeting there!

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:38.130 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Do wells still even exist?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
I see. This sounds like a job

00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:43.719 position:50% align:center
for a bunch of super
sleuths. Am I right?

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm?

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:47.598 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA] The Meguro River
Detective Agency is on the case!

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
Let's find Hime a well!

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:52.978 position:50% align:center
Um, aren't I part
of this agency?

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What's going on? A
meeting about a birthday party?

00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
But Hime's birthday is still
at least six months away!

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.363 position:50% align:center
Well, that should do it.

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your work
on this manuscript.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Wait a sec!

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'll even practice!

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
I'll get so good at frying
chicken you won't be able

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
to resist it! Even if
you're totally stuffed!

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Could that be it?
Does she think I was lying?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to say that the editors'

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
meeting went great,
thanks to you.

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, you had
an editors' meeting?

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's the one you
were worried about.

00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:30.516 position:50% align:center
What would I care
about that for?

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.934 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Could it be...?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.936 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hey, this place looks great.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
But also pretty
expensive. I know!

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
By the way.
The editor-in-chief told me

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
that he'd like to invite you out
for a meal in the near future.

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:44.071 position:50% align:center
Wah!

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.532 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] The editor-in-chief
wants to talk to me?

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:51.203 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It's happening.
I'm getting the axe.

00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Must be nice getting
to eat something yummy

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
with the editor-in-chief.
I bet it's somewhere expensive.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Idiot. If the
editor-in-chief wants to

00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:05.092 position:50% align:center
take you out someplace fancy,
it's definitely bad news.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Prepare for the worst.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:11.682 position:50% align:center
Just a heads up,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.560 position:50% align:center
apparently Goto wants to meet
you for dinner somewhere.

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.103 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.940 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] Why, though? Is he
unhappy about something?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.985 position:50% align:center
I really don't want to argue
with one of our creators.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know. Is it
because we haven't

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
let him do colored
pages in forever?

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll go ahead
and book a place.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I was right,
this place is delicious!

00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] My story's
definitely getting the axe.

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.971 position:50% align:center
Can I please have a timeline
for when it'll happen?

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.850 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] Crap! So this is
about having colored pages.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:58.562 position:50% align:center
Uh, let me think. As soon
as possible, of course.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.607 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] Lies! The soonest I
could do is four weeks from now!

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.192 position:50% align:center
As soon as possible?

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.861 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] No way I can
wrap up the story that fast!

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.573 position:50% align:center
Ooh. I wonder what
this thingy is?

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
Could we maybe try and shoot
for at least ten weeks out?

00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.578 position:50% align:center
What? For real, that far?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.163 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Is that asking too much?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.
We can make that work.

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
It'll give us time to prepare.

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
Prepare? Prepare for what?

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO]
You know. Colored pages.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Colored pages? I see.

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate this.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.523 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Isn't it great
that you got colored pages

00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:43.774 position:50% align:center
for some reason?

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Meh. It's just
a consolation prize.

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Mmm...

00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's not like I don't
see it for what it is.

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:54.201 position:50% align:center
He's letting me
go out with a bang.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.537 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI grunts]
I got to feed one of my creators

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.373 position:50% align:center
a delicious dinner and
got him colored pages.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.835 position:50% align:center
I'm like the best editor in
the history of all editors!

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:04.962 position:50% align:center
We're lucky we were out
with the chief editor.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.257 position:50% align:center
'Cause we could never afford
that place on our own.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.970 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What should I tell everyone?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
Maybe I can help them find
other artists to work under.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
Or continue to pay them until
we can secure our next title.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.647 position:50% align:center
But I have no idea when
I'll get my next title.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
I don't even know what
magazine it'd be for.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.818 position:50% align:center
And my pockets aren't so deep

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.863 position:50% align:center
that I could keep paying
everyone until that happened.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
The span between titles

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:38.996 position:50% align:center
is truly the worst time
for a manga artist.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.581 position:50% align:center
When a fish who needs
to keep swimming

00:09:40.664 --> 00:09:43.000 position:50% align:center
to survive stops swimming,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
it's never that easy
to start back up again.

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
Before you know it,
a year goes by,

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:51.300 position:50% align:center
and then another,
and then you're forgotten

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.552 position:50% align:center
by your readers and editors.

00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Your funds keep going down,

00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
but your bills remain the same.

00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:01.435 position:50% align:center
You just watch your
savings dwindle.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
Everything feels hopeless.

00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:07.024 position:50% align:center
The manga artist becomes more
and more emotionally unstable,

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
so they can't think up new
or interesting ideas.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
They're stuck in
a vicious cycle.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.742 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That's the way the world works.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
Everything costs money.

00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:36.178 position:50% align:center
Daddy? Is that you?

[HIME]
Kotatsus sure are scary.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:43.060 position:50% align:center
I was sitting here waiting for
you and it just put me to sleep.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.063 position:50% align:center
Careful, you don't
want to catch a cold.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh wow, I almost forgot.

00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:49.650 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh?

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.944 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, Daddy.
I missed you.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.658 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Hime. Love you.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I don't know
what the future holds,

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:05.916 position:50% align:center
but whatever happens, I'll try
to smile around her. Always.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
So <i>Tights in the Wind</i>

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:11.839 position:50% align:center
will be wrapping up here
in the next ten weeks.

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:13.215 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.925 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's a real shame.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
You can at least act surprised!
Doesn't it make you sad?

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:21.515 position:50% align:center
Uh, no? Mangas have to
end sooner or later.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd be sad if I were you!

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
No manga means no job,
you'll be unemployed!

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:27.688 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I've been wanting
to work more on my own stuff.

00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:31.525 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Same here.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
This actually gives me
the opportunity to go back

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
to college and get the rest of
the credits I need to graduate.

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:37.948 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
And I--

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.116 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Please don't worry about us.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.118 position:50% align:center

to make me feel better.

[KAKUSHI]
That's what I've gotta do.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.722 position:50% align:center
Right now, I have to
focus on my manga.

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center

was the perfect moment, but...

him for time off sometimes.

Yes. It's kind of scary.

If I have to end it,

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center

Have you noticed how
amazing <i>Tights in the Wind</i>

I bet he probably
feels more motivated

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:43.931 position:50% align:center
since I gave him
those colored pages.

[NARRATOR] There are times
when a manga series
