00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's here.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.940 position:50% align:center
The big year-end grind
is right on top of us!

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.358 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The year-end grind,

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.527 position:50% align:center
AKA "The Editorial Department
wants to take a bunch

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
of time off over the holidays,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.613 position:50% align:center
so now they've become
heartless slave drivers

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
to make sure the manga artists

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.616 position:50% align:center
turn in their
manuscripts on time."

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
I guess that means we'll
just have to start getting

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.245 position:50% align:center
our work done a
little bit earlier.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
We've got this!

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.623 position:50% align:center
You're oddly positive.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.250 position:50% align:center
We sure are!

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] After all, the Godansha
Thank You Party awaits!

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.546 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.797 position:50% align:center
Please, sir.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.091 position:50% align:center
Won't you please take me
to the party with you?

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
Stop with the puppy dog eyes!
They won't work. I'm not going.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.638 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA cries]

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
Crying won't work, either!

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.393 position:50% align:center
That party was the only
motivation I had to draw.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.687 position:50% align:center
I'm too sad to do anything.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Wait. It really means
that much to you guys?

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Of course,
we're always cooped up

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.277 position:50% align:center
in this stuffy little studio.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.779 position:50% align:center
But when we go to the big
thank you party,

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
we get to feel like we're
actually a part of the industry!

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.492 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] You have to let us go,
we're begging you!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.122 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Whatever, just stop
acting like leeches, okay?

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.250 position:50% align:center
The party was cancelled.
Womp-womp.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.585 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.712 position:50% align:center
They cut costs due to
the publishing recession,

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.381 position:50% align:center
so they just rented out
a bar and a karaoke place.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.632 position:50% align:center
Instead of a fancy party,

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:34.261 position:50% align:center
it's more like a small,
humble gathering.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.598 position:50% align:center
So a bar and karaoke?

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.600 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm sure
they'll be disappointed,

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:42.394 position:50% align:center
but what could I do?

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:43.562 position:50% align:center
I'm back.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
All right!
Give us all the details!

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.566 position:50% align:center
A hotel party, right?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.194 position:50% align:center
Guess what? I bought
a fancy dress for it!

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.696 position:50% align:center
And I bought a digital camera!

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So, I have a secret.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.831 position:50% align:center
There's no party, just sadness.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Morning.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.301 position:50% align:center
Hi, Daddy. Good morning.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
The Christmas tree? You need
some help putting it away?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Huh? Why? Did I
bring it out too early?

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:50.355 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No! It's not early at
all. I mean, it is December!

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Uhh... Okay.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That was close.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
I just finished the Christmas
chapter last week,

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
so I thought it was
already over.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:01.283 position:50% align:center
[HIME] And check it out,
I even put up a chandelier!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.036 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uhhh, that's a disco ball.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, I thought
it was a chandelier.

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.040 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI chuckles]

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Don't laugh.
I've never seen one.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.336 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] You probably
just don't remember,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center
but I think you actually saw
a smaller one in town.

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
Really? There are bigger ones?
I'd love to see it one day.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Well, lucky for you,
there is a big chandelier!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
At the party venue.
And it's enormous.

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:34.942 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you could take Hime
with you and show it to her.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.193 position:50% align:center
Come on. For real?

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm kidding!

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
I know you'd never risk her
finding out that you draw manga.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to enjoy the
chandelier enough for her!

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
I could even take a picture
for her with my new camera!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.208 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Except, you guys won't
be seeing the chandelier either.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
By the way. What's that?

00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:56.964 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Reference. I need it
for the New Year's chapter.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Right. Sometimes I forget

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
what timeline I'm living in.

00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] We're still waiting
for Christmas IRL.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.389 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah, and having
Christmas come again

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
when it was over
for me weeks ago.

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.643 position:50% align:center
I almost feel like
I'm a time traveler.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Wow, I can't wait!

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.232 position:50% align:center
Oh, Christmas. I hope
you get here soon!

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
You know what? You're like
a kid. It's still weeks away.

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:21.572 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] She fell for it!
Thanks to my acting skills,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
Hime will never find out
that I'm a time traveler.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
No! I'm fine! Uh...

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking how
it's almost "Shiwasu"!

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.541 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm? "Shiwasu"?

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.294 position:50% align:center
Yep! You see...
It's another word for when

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.421 position:50% align:center
senseis are in a
rush in December.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.549 position:50% align:center
Oh, like teachers!

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Look at her go!
She's really is rushing.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
[RIKO] Yeah, but Ms. Ichiko
is always running.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
I guess that's true.

00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
Does that mean everyone running
around right now is a teacher?

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:57.274 position:50% align:center
Um... I think they must be.
That's what my daddy said.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.568 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA] I wonder what
makes teachers so busy.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.903 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA] Actually, a lot of
people are referred to

00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
as "Sensei."

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.158 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
Like doctors. Politicians.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
Artists. And manga artists.

00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:13.332 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU A]
Sensei! Come on, hurry!

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.210 position:50% align:center
Check it out! There's one
left, it's like a miracle!

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:19.755 position:50% align:center
You have the best luck ever!
I'm jealous, Sensei!

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.466 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Isn't it odd how many
people are called "Sensei"?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.219 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's used
as an insult, though.

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
I know for sure some editors
call manga artists "Sensei"

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
out of spite.

00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're not finished yet?
Wow, Sensei.

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real? A sensei should
turn their stuff in on time.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And it always seems
to be laced with sarcasm.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:41.610 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, Mister Goto.
I'm sorry.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.070 position:50% align:center
Nah, you're cool.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
Get this, once you become
a veteran, they level it up

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.783 position:50% align:center
and call you a "Virtuoso."

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Then they tack on a
geographical location.

00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:55.082 position:50% align:center
Editors are a bunch of elitists.
They always look down on us

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.793 position:50% align:center
manga artists,
it just isn't fair!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
You're being a bit dramatic.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.504 position:50% align:center
No, I am not!

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.632 position:50% align:center
A true virtuoso isn't called
that to their face!

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.678 position:50% align:center
Hi! How's my Virtuoso?
What's up?

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
What was I just saying?

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:11.515 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Well, hopefully one day soon,

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
there will be people
who call me "Sensei."

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.396 position:50% align:center
It's better than being
a nameless assistant.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.566 position:50% align:center
Still though. There's a
silver lining to all this.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.109 position:50% align:center
There's the one time a year

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.570 position:50% align:center
where we all get
to feel important.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.947 position:50% align:center
It's the big Thank You Party!

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
What the...?
Didn't anyone tell you?

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
Don't say it!

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.001 position:50% align:center
Look at what you've done!

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.545 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
why you're so angry!

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.005 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Screw this crap.
Nobody loves me.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.298 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Yeah, who cares?

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
Everything feels so
bleak, I just can't.

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:50.304 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] No fair.
We wanna go to the party.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.014 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Wow, they're
kinda like a really sad

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
chocolate fountain.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Looks like their
motivation has hit rock bottom.

00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
At this rate we'll never get
through the year-end grind.

00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:03.442 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA gasps]

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] There's only one way
you could possibly help us

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:07.446 position:50% align:center
regain our will to work.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.031 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] It's this. Chugakukan's
party! Take us there instead!

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.077 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
For real?

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.205 position:50% align:center
Last I checked, they're
having a fancy party.

00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
That's true, but I haven't
worked with them in forever.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.043 position:50% align:center
Besides, all the editors I knew

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
have moved on to different
places by now.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
I doubt anyone there knows me.

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:27.883 position:50% align:center
It'd be super awkward.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.885 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] But that means
you could take Hime!

[gasps]

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:31.887 position:50% align:center
It's perfect.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.055 position:50% align:center
If they don't know who you are,

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.057 position:50% align:center
then no one will out you
as a manga artist.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.477 position:50% align:center
You'll be able to show little
Hime that chandelier after all!

[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.605 position:50% align:center
Any place that throws
a big party like that

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.232 position:50% align:center
comes off as
prestigious, y'know?

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.776 position:50% align:center
It'll up your
street cred as a father!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.779 position:50% align:center
Street cred, eh? Okay.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
Wow, Daddy! You're cool!

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.201 position:50% align:center
Listen up, you guys! We're
going to Chugakukan's party!

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:56.912 position:50% align:center
Count me in!

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
No way. He actually bought it.

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
He's so easy to manipulate.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.668 position:50% align:center
I want to go, too.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
Are you stupid?
You can't show up there.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.547 position:50% align:center
It'll just cause trouble.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.924 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean? How so?

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.634 position:50% align:center
Because they'll obviously
think you're there

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
to steal their artists.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.222 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] True. It sounds like
the perfect opportunity!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.557 position:50% align:center
Please take me with you!

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
There's no way in hell I would.

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, both events
are on the same day.

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.564 position:50% align:center
You should go to your own
company's gathering.

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
To a small bar with karaoke?

00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hard pass
on that lame sauce.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You're not coming!

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Wait, Goto isn't
coming to our party?

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
It's going to make us look real
bad if people don't show up.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.828 position:50% align:center
I don't care what you do,
but bring someone.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Wait. It can be anyone?

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:42.249 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI gasping]

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
[HIME] There's going to be
a chandelier?

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
Yep. It's a big party
for your dad's company.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.839 position:50% align:center
Wanna go with me?

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.551 position:50% align:center
So then... Are we party people?

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
I suppose so. As in people
who go to parties.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
Do you think we could
take Nadila with us?

00:09:57.848 --> 00:09:59.558 position:50% align:center
I bet she would love to go!

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.144 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Of course!

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.313 position:50% align:center
I'm going to go with
some work friends.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
You and Nadila can
meet up with me later.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
Sound like a plan?

00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:09.276 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yeah!

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
Miss Hime. Once I'm done
with laundry, we can leave.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:21.330 position:50% align:center
Okay, then! I'll go get ready.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:22.206 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Nadila!

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.625 position:50% align:center
Huh? CEO?

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:29.588 position:50% align:center
Hello! This is a party invite.
I'd love for you to come!

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.465 position:50% align:center
Ah. For Mister's party?

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you knew! I hope
to see you there, then.

00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:41.642 position:50% align:center
They're late.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.894 position:50% align:center
I just checked the coat room
and they're not there.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.188 position:50% align:center
Man, I knew I should've
come with her!

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.899 position:50% align:center
Where are you, Hime?

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
Over here! I've been waiting
for you! You look great!

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:58.909 position:50% align:center
Hello there.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're here, too?
Does that mean...?

00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:06.250 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Does this mean
you're coming to our party?

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.960 position:50% align:center
Wait, Hime's with you?

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.628 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Sure is.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness! That's awful!
'Cause that means

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:15.509 position:50% align:center
there's a definite
possibility she'll find out

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.636 position:50% align:center
I'm a manga artist! No!

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.513 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Boss, wait!

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
A chandelier. So then,
does that mean I was right?

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.817 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Yo! Wassup?

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
Hime. Your dad says he's here.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.281 position:50% align:center
Okay, thank you!

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hime!

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
He's in a rush.
Does that mean...?

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
I'm right here, Daddy!

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.999 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hime!

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.960 position:50% align:center
Daddy. Are you a sensei?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.253 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
She knows!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
What? Of course not!
Why would you think that?

00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
Please let me try
to explain, okay?

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
Just now. You were rushing.

00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Your dad's right.

00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
No way is this guy
a silly ol' sensei.

00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:04.975 position:50% align:center
He's much more.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.978 position:50% align:center
Your ol' man is what
we call a virtuoso.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.439 position:50% align:center
Right? Tell her.

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:11.732 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI growls]

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Oh, it's another
title you get at work,

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
like department chief
or section chief.

00:12:18.197 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
Oh... Okay. If that's the case,
then, you shouldn't be rushing.

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:24.870 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
I hope the boss
comes back soon.

00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
We can't get into
the party without him.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.168 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU sneezing]

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
See there?

00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:42.888 position:50% align:center
That's the big chandelier
I was telling you about.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.351 position:50% align:center
It's huge! But you're wrong.
That's something else.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Something that fancy
has to be a Cinderella.

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:55.317 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Uh... I guess.
They do sort of sound the same.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Yeah, but also, it looks
like Cinderella's dress!

00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:01.365 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hmm, maybe a little.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.243 position:50% align:center
I can see it.
Back when I was her age,

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:06.745 position:50% align:center
I also thought it was
called a Cinderella.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
Sounds like that might
just be a girl thing.

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
Oh, I followed you guys in.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.963 position:50% align:center
Well, I really don't think
you should be here.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I've come
to deliver Goto's scarf.

00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
But it's just an act.

00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:21.844 position:50% align:center
I'm actually here
to scout me a winner!

00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
I think you switched
your out loud line

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
with your mental line.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.390 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.933 position:50% align:center
how do you intend to pick out
the manga artists

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
in this crowd of people?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
That's easy! They'll probably
be dressed like hobos.

00:13:32.396 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Wow, burn.

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.983 position:50% align:center
What if you find an
assistant instead?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.861 position:50% align:center
Oh, that part's pretty simple.

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.113 position:50% align:center
Publishers can't leave
popular manga artists

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
to fend for themselves,
so they always make sure

00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.950 position:50% align:center
their editor is with them.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
The editors are the ones
hosting the party,

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.998 position:50% align:center
so they're always in suits
they can't afford. Meaning...

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
Look for the hobo who's
being guarded by a guy

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
in a business suit.
That's the manga artist!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
Burn times two.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.422 position:50% align:center
She actually said that.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
Makes sense, but there's one
small problem with that plan.

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
See, when it comes to
drawing shonen manga,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.846 position:50% align:center
the popular artists
are usually women.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.724 position:50% align:center
Wow. Booze just totally
erases your filter, doesn't it?

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.309 position:50% align:center
Their style is different.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.187 position:50% align:center
A lot of female artists like to
wear frilly dresses and stuff

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
that doesn't really
match their age.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:17.900 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] I see! So I just
need to find some frilly dresses

00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:19.860 position:50% align:center
guarded by people in suits!

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.906 position:50% align:center
There's one! Hey, you
wanna work for me?

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:24.990 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm?

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
Oopsie. Uh. Not good.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:33.749 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] A mean-looking guy
in a suit, and a frilly dress.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:37.503 position:50% align:center
--So, hey. You dropped this.
--[KAKUSHI] Come!

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI yelps] Ohh, I can't
believe I got yelled at

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.759 position:50% align:center
like that when I'm a grown man!

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.636 position:50% align:center
You only have yourself to blame.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh! It's Mr. Goto's fault!

00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
It's not fair that
he's wearing a suit

00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:52.935 position:50% align:center
when he's a manga artist!
He looks so professional!

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.521 position:50% align:center
But he's supposed to
look like a dirty hobo!

00:14:55.604 --> 00:14:56.939 position:50% align:center
Actually, you're really lucky

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:59.024 position:50% align:center
that you ran into the
bossman instead.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.485 position:50% align:center
If you ran into a different
artist and their editor...

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.320 position:50% align:center
Well, you would have
got your ass beat.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.948 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI wails]

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
[HIME hums] I feel like I've
seen that man somewhere before.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
I wonder where?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.956 position:50% align:center
Remember to always
be careful, Hime.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.541 position:50% align:center
There're strangers here.

00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.543 position:50% align:center
He's not strange,
I know his name.

00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:19.628 position:50% align:center
See here?

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Crap!
She actually took his card?

00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
[HIME] It looks like he works
for a company that makes books.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.971 position:50% align:center
But I don't think
I'm a good fit.

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
Because... I'm not that cute,
at least not like Naru is.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry?

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
That's why I can't do it.
Be a model.

00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:41.400 position:50% align:center
Model, eh?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I get it.

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
She thinks she was scouted
to be a magazine model.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're adorable, and I'm
sure you'd be great at it.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.827 position:50% align:center
No way, you're just saying that.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.580 position:50% align:center
I actually mean it. Okay.

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
How about I hold
onto that card for you

00:15:56.582 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
until you make up your mind?

00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:04.173 position:50% align:center
[HIME] All right. Here. Here.
Here. Here. Here.

00:16:04.256 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Talent agencies
and kids' magazines?

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:11.847 position:50% align:center
You mean people actually did
scout her? When, though?

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.974 position:50% align:center
Have I unknowingly brought
my sweet daughter

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
into a den full of
bloodthirsty wolves?

00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
This may be a party for manga,

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.191 position:50% align:center
but there're gravure spreads
in their magazines!

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:23.734 position:50% align:center
[AGENTS chuckle]

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Meaning there are
people recruiting gravure idols!

00:16:26.862 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
And people who deal with anime

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.449 position:50% align:center
and live-action
versions of manga!

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:34.203 position:50% align:center
This whole place is
a cesspool of evil!

00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
This isn't a lighthearted
party with just

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
manga artists and editors.

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
Wait. I forgot the worst part.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:44.213 position:50% align:center
That all manga artists
are basically lolicons!

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
We're leaving, Hime!

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:49.635 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
These are Satsuki's!

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
--[KAKUSHI] Come!
--[SATSUKI yelps]

00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
He dropped them.

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A] Hey, there's a spy
here from Godansha here!

00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:55.349 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Crap!

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.768 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable, they've got
some nerve crashing our party!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE C] I bet they're
here to swipe our talent!

00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
Find them! Hunt down
that Satsuki bastard!

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hime. Can you wait here for me?

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
And don't take any more cards.

00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI yelps] I've had enough,
please don't yell at me anymore!

00:17:11.657 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
They know you're here, genius.

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:16.912 position:50% align:center
And now Chugakukan's
going to wring your neck.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
No way! But I haven't
even done anything yet!

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.250 position:50% align:center
You did everything!

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
Anyway, get out of here.
Before they find you.

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
He can't...

00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Looks like they've
blocked off all the exits!

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.551 position:50% align:center
It's fine, they don't know
what he looks like.

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
Except. His Facebook
page is public

00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:37.808 position:50% align:center
so they probably know by now.
It's pretty easy to find.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.269 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Checkmate. Guess he dies.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
No, please!

00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:43.981 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Actually...

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.650 position:50% align:center
There is one way to get
out of here unnoticed.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.403 position:50% align:center
He just has to act like
he's a manga artist.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.946 position:50% align:center
Will it work?

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hm, maybe. If they're
dealing with a manga artist,

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:57.286 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't bother to check
that carefully. Okay!

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:03.709 position:50% align:center
Go grab some
merchandise we can use!

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.294 position:50% align:center
And voila!

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.298 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Check it out!

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
[AMI] He looks just
like a manga artist!

00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] For some reason,
I feel slightly offended

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:15.971 position:50% align:center
by their reactions.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Crap! This is no time
to play around!

00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry up
and get him out of here.

00:18:21.852 --> 00:18:24.563 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] So kind.
You may be mean sometimes,

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.441 position:50% align:center
but deep down,
you really do care about me.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Satsuki. You're such an idiot,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.738 position:50% align:center
and I really don't wanna
have to clean up your mess.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.614 position:50% align:center
Get out of here!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.740 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Right!

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.452 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I need to grab Hime and scram!

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:41.288 position:50% align:center
Before any of those
creepers find her!

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.873 position:50% align:center
That manga artist...

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:47.586 position:50% align:center
Or that one.
They could all be perverts!

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.755 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR C] That man is sizing
up the room like a hunter

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:54.051 position:50% align:center
eyeing his prey.
It must be him.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.928 position:50% align:center
You're that Satsuki, aren't you?

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.639 position:50% align:center
Wait! You've got
the wrong guy! Uh!

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:02.309 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR C]
So you are him!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.603 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Of course.
The card I took from Hime.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
No, that's not mine!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:09.942 position:50% align:center
Hey, we found the guy!

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:13.237 position:50% align:center
[MOB MEMBER B]
Come on. Let's get him!

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
Hi, Hime. Can you please
come with me?

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
But I don't know you.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
I'm your dad's...

00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:32.381 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR C]
You liar!

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
Like a manga artist would
ever wear a suit!

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Well... Guess they're
gonna arrest the wrong guy.

00:19:40.514 --> 00:19:43.392 position:50% align:center
I'll meet my end at
Chugakukan's hands.

[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.231 position:50% align:center
Huh? Whoa, is that
you Goto? How are ya?

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:51.567 position:50% align:center

Osewani. It's been a while.

We're sorry for mobbing you!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
Please allow us to
buy you a new suit.

00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:02.828 position:50% align:center
It's fine, don't go
to any trouble.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center

A manga artist.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Just shut up! Ugh...

00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
Well, if I wear a coat over it,
I doubt Hime will even notice.

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
I need to hurry up and
get Hime out of here!

00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:19.136 position:50% align:center

an eye on her for you.

What?

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
So this is where
you've been all night.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect to see you.
Hey, there.

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we just
dropped in to say hi.

00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:33.859 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh? Is that even allowed?

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.736 position:50% align:center
You're the editors of <i>Mangazine.</i>

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] Well, considering
the circumstances...

00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:40.157 position:50% align:center
We don't really have
the time to fight.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.034 position:50% align:center
So it's not that big of a deal.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:46.288 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm... Then why'd I get beat up?

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
[exhales] It's super cold out
tonight. Isn't it, Daddy?

Yeah. It sure is.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:56.173 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait. Where is your coat?

00:20:56.256 --> 00:21:02.179 position:50% align:center

That bastard.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
Wanna use my scarf? You can.

00:21:05.516 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
That's very sweet,
but I'll be okay.

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.937 position:50% align:center
So, anyway. Did you have
lots of fun tonight?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.648 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! The Cinderella
was amazing!

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
It was so big! And sparkly!
Kinda like diamonds!

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:18.320 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Uh?

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.322 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
Daddy. What's that?

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Oh, wow!
Check out this Cinderella!

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:32.793 position:50% align:center
It's more like a
super-Cinderella! Heh.

[KAKUSHI chuckles]

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I want to protect that
smile. So I'll keep it a secret.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
I won't let her find out
that I'm a manga artist.

Welcome, sir.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:04.449 position:50% align:center
