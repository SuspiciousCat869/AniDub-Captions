[KAKUSHI]
Have you picked a name yet?

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:24.066 position:50% align:center
We'll need to register him soon,
so we need to get on that.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
I know. But I just can't decide.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
We can't call him or anything
if he doesn't have a name.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.323 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm...

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
Okay. How 'bout this
in the meantime?

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[ROKU whines]

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.083 position:50% align:center
A tentative name?

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Tentative names are a bad idea.

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.473 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Same goes for manga titles.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
You use "tentative" when
you're planning things out,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.646 position:50% align:center
then slowly, the more you work,
the more it sticks.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.191 position:50% align:center
And you end up getting trapped
with some lame title.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
Have you done that before?

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
Once or twice.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.197 position:50% align:center
Okay, every time.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
I get so used to
the temporary names

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
that I never bother to come
up with new ones.

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.036 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that
you're not supposed

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
to give foster dogs a name.

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:45.666 position:50% align:center
Because then you might
get too attached to them.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
They only get a permanent name
once they've been adopted

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
into their new family.

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
Um. Something wrong?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.222 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] We can't keep using a
tentative name for the puppy.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.640 position:50% align:center
So decide.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.393 position:50% align:center
He needs a good one. Understand?

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
Go on.

What should I do?

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.574 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:23.328 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well you see,
my dog's name...

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:26.582 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. That's right,
you gotta record it here.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
Uh... Um.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but did
you just say Goto?

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.422 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST]
Hm? I said you gotta record it.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
[whispers] "Goto Roku."

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:38.260 position:50% align:center
"Goto Roku."

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that name is perfect!

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.850 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy! I'm all done.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.852 position:50% align:center
Did you pick a name? Or no.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.897 position:50% align:center
The receptionist picked for me.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.273 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Eh?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.316 position:50% align:center
[ROKU barks]

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.735 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Roku Goto.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.989 position:50% align:center
[HIME giggles]
Roku! Roku!

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Isn't it perfect? And it's all
thanks to the clerk lady!

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.871 position:50% align:center
When she said it, I knew
it was the right choice!

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
Is that so?
You're okay with that?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.627 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm... Yeah, it's fine!

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.214 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter who named him,
as long as it fits.

00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
You're right, Hime.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:41.657 position:50% align:center
[AMI laughs] She heard
"Gotta record" as "Goto Roku"?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.075 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.536 position:50% align:center
Jeez, get a grip, Ami,
it's not like it's that funny.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.371 position:50% align:center
Still, though.
Hime thinking the dog

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
already had a name by
default is so like her.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.376 position:50% align:center
It's adorable. In a weird way,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
it makes me wish that I had
a cuter name by default.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.923 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Unfortunately, it's
harder to change your given name

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.800 position:50% align:center
than your family name in Japan.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that true?

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
Besides, pretty much the
entire time I've known you,

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:05.097 position:50% align:center
I've called you Rasuna.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.932 position:50% align:center
So, it'd be awkward if you
changed your name

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
all of the sudden.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.852 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kinda weird
to change things

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.687 position:50% align:center
once you've already made
a first impression.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
Well, that makes sense.

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
I guess I act like
a Rasuna, huh?

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.942 position:50% align:center
Yes, obviously.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
Even if a Kobuhei changes
their name to Shozo,

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
they'll always be a true
Kobuhei at heart.

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
Don't take this the
wrong way or anything,

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.662 position:50% align:center
but I'm starting to understand
why you annoy the boss so much.

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.584 position:50% align:center
Why so creaky?

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I was thinking
about first impressions.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
When it comes to manga,

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
I kind of feel like the line art
can't surpass the pencil art.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:45.012 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Ah. Yeah.
I've actually heard that a lot.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Well, back to the grindstone.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.271 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's no use!
I can't surpass the rough draft!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.857 position:50% align:center
Who cares? Stop throwing manga!

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
In that case...

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:01.153 position:50% align:center
Why don't we just publish
the rough draft instead?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.322 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
I approve.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.198 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.574 position:50% align:center
Wait... For real?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
Just publishing the rough draft.

00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
If only I had realized sooner
that it was really that simple!

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:13.040 position:50% align:center
Printing technology
is super advanced.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
We can make it work!

Putting the creator's
best work onto the page

the editorial department

Yeah, this is true innovation!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] That would
never work, you dumbass!

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.225 position:50% align:center
Huh, how exciting.

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.936 position:50% align:center
Only one person has ever
published their rough draft,

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
but I get to be the second!

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center

painting of Hime's mom.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center

it to the storage room yet?

do it the next time I saw him.

It's fine. I'll take care of it.

[KAKUSHI] What makes first
impressions so important?

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
Why's it so hard to change them?

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Is it because we're just busy?

00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:10.848 position:50% align:center
Because society moves too fast?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.563 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That should do it.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.995 position:50% align:center

Did he paint this?

mess up right away.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:18.225 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to introduce
myself but was too nervous,

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
so I didn't say anything.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
It's like I put up a
huge, awkward barrier

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center
and no one in class wanted
to talk to me afterward.

believes Hime saved her.

00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:57.848 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's onto something.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.979 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's a feeling I can relate to.

00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:10.027 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Well?
Did you surpass your draft?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
Or are you stuck?

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:14.323 position:50% align:center
Not yet, but I
came up with a plan.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
In order to ink lines
better than the draft,

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
I just have to make the
first draft look worse!

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, you're a genius!

00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:24.917 position:50% align:center
[RIKIRO] Like this would
ever work, dumbass!

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll see you later.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.884 position:50% align:center
Have a good day.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
Huh? No school?

00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I'm off because
of Foundation Day.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I wanna go play with Hime.

00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Well, why don't you?

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
It's not like you
have set hours.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Because if I do,
she'll figure out

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
that I don't have some
strict office job

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
like she thought,
and that would be terrible!

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
Kinda strange though,

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
do they celebrate
foundation day every year?

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
I dunno, personally I think
celebrating every fifth

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
or tenth anniversary
is more than enough.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.668 position:50% align:center
Good news!
I'm gonna do my best this year!

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.670 position:50% align:center
You do know it's
November, right?

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.922 position:50% align:center
Yes! Weekly Shonen
Mangazine's last issue

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.383 position:50% align:center
of the year is released
in November.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:17.302 position:50% align:center
And it also commemorates
its 38th anniversary!

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
Sounds kinda half-assed to me.

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:21.557 position:50% align:center
Sort of a weird thing
to flex on.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
The editorial department's
going all out!

00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:27.563 position:50% align:center
We have lots of special plans
for this sparkling anniversary!

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[AMI] It's cool that you're
so hyped or whatever.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
But why not just save it
for the 40th anniversary?

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] With magazines
or really anything else,

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.700 position:50% align:center
if you just celebrate
random anniversaries,

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
it could be a sign
of trouble to come.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Is it just me or is he
acting awfully casual?

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
Who knows, he probably just
wanted something to brag about.

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:54.590 position:50% align:center
Obsessing over a
dumb anniversary.

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
That's such a girl thing.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
Oh, on a somewhat related note.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
Huh? Related how?

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.182 position:50% align:center
Well, uh... Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
Is this really it?

00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:08.312 position:50% align:center
Huh? Is what really what?

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.022 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Um. It's just...

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
Whisper, whisper,
whisper, whisper.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.193 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!
I guess you're right!

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:17.196 position:50% align:center
With this issue, "Tights
in the Wind" is celebrating

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
its 100th chapter.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.574 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.160 position:50% align:center
They totally ignored it,
how could they?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.163 position:50% align:center
Not a single word
of congratulations.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Is it supposed to be
a big deal or something?

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:31.043 position:50% align:center
It's only the hundredth chapter.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. Sorta.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.339 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Satsuki...

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
With its hundredth chapter,

00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
you could say a manga has
done its duty in a magazine.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.596 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we get space on
the cover, or colored pages,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.516 position:50% align:center
or have a giveaway?
It's not like it would kill you

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
to do your job and
promote us a little bit.

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to know to do that

00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:51.897 position:50% align:center
if you don't tell me
about it first?

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.774 position:50% align:center
I don't know, because
that's part of your role

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.317 position:50% align:center
as an editor, maybe?!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.319 position:50% align:center
I knew as your assistant!

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on,
I'm not even the first editor.

00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:02.074 position:50% align:center
Why would I bother
to count that stuff?

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.952 position:50% align:center
I have no idea why you're so
obsessed with a dumb number.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.621 position:50% align:center
That's such a girl thing.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.332 position:50% align:center
Why I oughta--!

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
I feel attacked.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.961 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] When I'm done with
you, you won't feel anything!

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] This is so weird,
please stop!

00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:19.383 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI, KAKUSHI scream]

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI, KAKUSHI panting]

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute,
if you knew about this,

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
then why didn't you say
anything to me, Rasuna?

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right. What gives?

00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:32.646 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Because it was
a special surprise.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
A surprise?

00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:39.111 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Yep! I wanted to surprise you.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
See here? I drew a
flash mob celebrating it.

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
Are you shocked?

00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
No. And please stop
doing things like this.

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:51.415 position:50% align:center
Why so grumpy?
You know you love it.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.958 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
I don't wanna ruin this moment.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
So I won't mention how this
randomly interrupts the story.

00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] I wanna know
how that made it through

00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
the final review unnoticed.

00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
[AMI] By that point, we're all
too exhausted to even care.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hey, I'm home.

00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:12.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, hi, Daddy!

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why are you so panicked?

00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Um. No reason.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.276 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't hide things from--

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.611 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.863 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Is everything okay?

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yep! All good!

00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:28.535 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It's just my guilt
coming back to stab me.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:32.456 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I swear
nothing's wrong.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:35.751 position:50% align:center
Same here! Everything's fine.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.921 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Well, you don't
really have room to talk.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yeah.

00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:42.883 position:50% align:center
Hime's just at that age where
you start wanting to keep

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
a few secrets.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
[AMI] How cute.
I wonder what she's hiding.

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:50.182 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Who knows?
It was some kind of paper.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
I've got it!

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.604 position:50% align:center
I betcha it's a love letter
from a boy in her class!

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.648 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
No way!

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Are you having
a panic attack?

00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
Well, Hime's a part of
the modern generation.

00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
Next they'll make a
shared social account.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
It'll have a photo
header of them both.

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.076 position:50% align:center
Announcing their anniversary!

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.078 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groaning]

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
He's dead.

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:14.081 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] We should give
him some time alone.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.507 position:50% align:center
So, um, I think I'm
going to tell them no.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.925 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.886 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Crap!
It really was a love letter?

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see. Well.

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth,
I think that's a good call!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
But whatever!

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:37.396 position:50% align:center
It's not like my opinion
matters, you know?

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.816 position:50% align:center
I suppose. I'll make
sure I tell them no.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hey, wait! If you
want, I could come with you!

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:47.990 position:50% align:center
They picked you, so they
have excellent taste.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.116 position:50% align:center
You need to make sure that

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
you're not rude and
decline sincerely.

00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:53.537 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Nope, I'm good.
See you later!

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.289 position:50% align:center
Ah, you sure?!

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.254 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] How dare someone
eye my little girl!

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Time to see what brat had
the balls to ask her out.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
Um, so listen.
About my reply.

00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I've got you now!

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.266 position:50% align:center
A girl?

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
[barks]

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.898 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
A birthday party invitation?

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.
What did you think it was?

00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Well, nothing important!

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:31.283 position:50% align:center
Anyway, so why did you
wanna say no to her?

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
I mean, after all,

00:16:32.743 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
tenth birthdays or 100 chapters
are a pretty big deal.

00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
Chapters?

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:39.166 position:50% align:center
Uh, never mind,
you can ignore that part.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I dunno, you were the one
who told me to politely decline.

00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:44.213 position:50% align:center
But. I didn't...

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:47.174 position:50% align:center
[HIME] And I'd really like
to celebrate with her.

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
But if I end up going,

00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:52.930 position:50% align:center
then I'll have to invite her
to my birthday party, too.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.932 position:50% align:center
Okay, why don't you?

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.309 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Well, because...

00:16:57.392 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
It's a whole lot of work for you
to prepare all by yourself.

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:02.356 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I mean, there's the
decorations and the cake.

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:08.612 position:50% align:center
Plus you would have to fry
up a bunch of chicken.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] You should celebrate.
While you can.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.368 position:50% align:center
These are milestones,
they're important.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.494 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Huh?!

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Someday...

00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
You may not be able to
celebrate, even if you want to.

00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.836 position:50% align:center
And on the other side of it,

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
let people celebrate for you,
while they can.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
So next year, you can invite
all your friends over,

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
and we'll throw a giant party.
How does that sound?

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
You sure? But the decorations...

00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm gonna
decorate the whole house.

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
And the cake.

00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:42.646 position:50% align:center
I'll make one so big
you can climb it!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
What about the fried chicken?

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
I'll make more than
you can possibly imagine!

00:17:46.984 --> 00:17:48.402 position:50% align:center
I'll even practice!

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.820 position:50% align:center
I'll get so good
at frying chicken

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.530 position:50% align:center
you won't be able to resist it!

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
Even if you're totally stuffed!

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:57.536 position:50% align:center
Okay? So go.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.413 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Considering how
good she was at preparing,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.253 position:50% align:center
I bet there's something
in here for birthdays.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:10.841 position:50% align:center
You know, mine seems kinda
half-assed compared to Hime's.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.010 position:50% align:center
Here we go! Jackpot.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:18:14.553 --> 00:18:17.431 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll go take more
lessons from Miss Shiokoshi,

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
then, I'll master fried chicken!

00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And the next day...

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.859 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Bye sweetie, have
a good time at your friend's.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I will! Bye, Daddy!

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.991 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.453 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI] I'm really sorry.
They've made a new rule.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid HQ won't
allow us to teach cooking

00:18:41.914 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
to single men anymore.

00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
As it turns out, a lot of men
were just joining the class

00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
to hit on the teachers. Oh,
but... Obviously I know

00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:52.883 position:50% align:center
that you're not like those
other guys, Mister Goto.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.761 position:50% align:center
That's unfortunate.
What should I do?

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
Maybe... We could come
up with a different way

00:18:58.889 --> 00:19:00.057 position:50% align:center
to solve your problem.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.643 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have a party,
too, will you guys come?

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:03.644 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?!

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
You know what else?

00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:06.647 position:50% align:center
My dad's gonna make
lots of fried chicken!

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real?

00:19:08.232 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
I don't think we've ever gone
to a party for you before.

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.614 position:50% align:center
Thanks for inviting me!
I'll definitely go!

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:22.788 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy! I'm home!

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
That's looking great! You're
doing wonderfully, Mister Goto.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.793 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I appreciate it.

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:32.840 position:50% align:center
Did you have fun
at the birthday party?

00:19:32.923 --> 00:19:35.551 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm-hm. Who is this?

00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
Oh, she's my cooking teacher.

00:19:37.553 --> 00:19:39.555 position:50% align:center
She came to your
sports festival.

00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:41.557 position:50% align:center
It's nice to see
you again, Hime.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you, too.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI] Oops, let's turn
the heat down a little bit.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You're the boss.

00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] So, did you have a
good time with your friends?

00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yep! It was great.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll have
to step up our game.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
Next year, you can
invite all of them over,

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:02.953 position:50% align:center
and we'll go hog wild!

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm-hm. Sounds like fun.

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.833 position:50% align:center
Still though...
Maybe this is dumb,

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
but I don't wanna give up my
birthday party with just you.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
And who says you have to?
We can still have both of them.

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm?

00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
You can have a celebration
with all of your friends,

00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:19.720 position:50% align:center
and then we can have one
with just the two of us.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
My plan has always been
to have two parties.

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Though... With Roku,
it'll be us three.

00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
I see. That makes sense.

00:20:29.188 --> 00:20:34.026 position:50% align:center
Hold on, if we have two,
will I grow older twice as fast?

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.987 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uhh... Maybe.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
I'll be an adult
in like four years.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
I'd be okay with that, though.

00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I wouldn't.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.926 position:50% align:center
It's just like our
house in Nakameguro.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:03.055 position:50% align:center
Except here, you have a
great view of the ocean.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.058 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts, sighs]

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Hm?

00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
I see. So this old house...

00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
...was made for me, my
father, and my mother.

00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
A house that was meant for
our family to live in together.

00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Couldn't he have just
drawn his manga here instead?

00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:40.801 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's no real
reason why he couldn't,

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
but I would have really
hated the commute.

00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:44.805 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same for me.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
But that's basically
why, though.

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
If he had to do a weekly
serial and raise a child

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
all on his own, I'm sure
it'd be pretty difficult.

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:59.820 position:50% align:center
And... I guess in the end,
it was too painful.

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, his job
would have stuck out here.

00:22:03.282 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] True. But there
were some good memories

00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
in that house in Kamakura.
If you want my opinion,

00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:13.125 position:50% align:center
that's why he built the
same one in Nakameguro.

00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:49.680 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] The big year-end grind
is right on top of us!

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:52.474 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Boss! Won't you please
take me to the party with you?

00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:53.642 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
No way!

00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:54.852 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Wait, I forgot the worst part.

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.854 position:50% align:center
All manga artists are
basically lolicons!
