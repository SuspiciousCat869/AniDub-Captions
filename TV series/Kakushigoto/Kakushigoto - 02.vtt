[KAKERU]
Yo! Hold up.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
What does it look like?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
We're making some gyoza.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
Check it out, doesn't
this one look amazing?

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah!
Great job with the folding.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Crap! We only have six
hours left until the deadline!

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
Is the manuscript done yet?

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
Uh, what? "Manuscript"?

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
Just shut up and fold
the dumplings, fool.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Look you guys,
this one's perfect!

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
You're killing it.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
Well done, Bossman!

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Oh, so this is what
it means to escape reality

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
right before a tough deadline.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] When a manga artist
wants to escape reality,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
they might do so by suddenly
rearranging their room,

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
or perhaps try cooking
an elaborate dish.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
They might even go as far as
cleaning the ventilation fan.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
Which, gross.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
All of this will bite them
in the ass, of course.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
Why don't they just
play video games?

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
Turns out that makes
them feel too guilty.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.327 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
Okay. Let's get to work.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Aren't we
gonna fry these up?

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:20.914 position:50% align:center
Course not.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
'Cause we have a manuscript
to finish, remember?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
What?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
We actually did it.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
You know, it wouldn't
have been such a crunch

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.801 position:50% align:center
if we hadn't wasted
time making gyoza.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.261 position:50% align:center
We only did it in time
because we made gyoza!

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.472 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're such an amateur!

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Huh? That doesn't
make any sense!

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Currently, my class
is spending some time

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
at the beach for Summer Camp.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
Hey, kids! Make sure you
all have your hats on!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI, HIME]
Num Num Time!

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
I like the curry you make,
it tastes really sweet.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
I have some time off,
starting tomorrow.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
I thought we could go
somewhere fun together.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
But I have to go to summer camp.
We leave tomorrow.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What? No one told me!

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Oh, I gave you a paper
about it over a month ago.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
Did you now?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
Um... You guys have a lot
of fun things planned?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
Yep! Like swimming, and bug
hunts, and building campfires!

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Swimming...
Bug hunts... Giant campfires?

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
Oh my god. I'm worried.
So worried!

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
And... Already lonely!

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Can't believe we're
taking a company trip

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
to the ocean. So sick.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Well, we were overdue
some time off. Let's forget

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
about manga stuff for a while
and have a little fun!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] So, where exactly
are we staying?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I borrowed a villa
from a friend of mine.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I'm surprised
they let you use it.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
We can thank the
Kamakura Fever for that.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
Though, technically,
we're going to Chiba.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
The whatty what?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Since time immemorial.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
This has been a way for manga
artists escape reality.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
It all started when a manga
artist became exhausted

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
by his weekly deadlines.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
He couldn't help but fantasize
about a different life

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
where he could work
by the ocean.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
And then one day,
he was able to find a place

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
to make manga in Kamakura.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
But beware. Because this is
where the true terror begins!

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
It was too far away
for his assistants!

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
All of the shops closed early!

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
The salty air made
his pen tips rust!

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Yep, in the end they
always get lonely.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
And naturally, move back
to Tokyo. A sad tale.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
But on the plus side, that's
why it was so easy for us

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
to borrow a villa for our trip.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Sure. Makes sense.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
You guys!

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
Come on, I said I wanted
to forget about manga.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Uh... Is this it?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI exhales]
Yep.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
Cool, instead of making manga,
we're sweating our balls off.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
[AMI] It's eerily similar to
what we do to escape deadlines.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Where'd the boss go?

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] The real reason I
chose Chiba... is obvious.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Stranger Danger!

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Mr. Goto?
What are you doing here?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
The thing is...

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
A company trip?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we happened to
be staying nearby.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
So you see...
I uh, couldn't help myself.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
There was just too much
cuteness to resist.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh my gosh, please
tell me you're joking!

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Never, it's overwhelming.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.
Don't tell Hime about this.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
Your secret's safe!

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
We're going for a rhinoceros
beetle hunt after this,

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
so that should keep her busy.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Rhinoceros beetles?

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
What if Hime's the only
kid who can't catch one

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
and gets made fun of?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
So, uh... Is my cuteness
really that overwhelming?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
Oh. He's gone.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
Listen up, Kakeru!

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's up?

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Go buy some rhinoceros beetles!

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
The biggest ones you can find.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
I'll just put 'em someplace
where they're easy to find.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
Why in the hell would you buy
a Hercules beetle, huh?!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Because you said to buy
the biggest one, remember?

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] If a little girl
found this in Chiba,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
it'd make headlines!
They'll say it was all rigged!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
Then her class will vote her off
the island or something!

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Forget the bug!
What else could go wrong?

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
Stranger danger!

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
Oh, back again?
What's the matter now?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
Come on. How was I
supposed to stay away?

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
You know, from all the cuteness.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Can you please
stop saying that?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
So, what's next
on the itinerary?

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
On Sundays I'm usually
just hanging out at home,

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
so I'm free or whatever.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
I meant for the kids.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
Duh! They're working
together to make curry.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
Hime is super excited

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.082 position:50% align:center
because she's in charge
of seasoning tonight.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
She is?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
[car braking]

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming so quickly.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
No problem, my son is a huge fan
of your manga, <i>Balls of Fury.</i>

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm counting on your help.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
[RIKO] Hime! Can you
help us wash the rice?

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Go!

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
[CHEF]
Namaste!

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO sighs] I can't believe
he called me cute twice.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
Could it be that Mr. Goto
actually thinks about me?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
No, you mustn't, Ichiko!

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
He's the father of one
of your students!

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Hime! That's all wrong!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
It's more of a
scratching motion.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
Didn't your mom
ever teach you that?

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Okay. I'll try again.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Uh... I just wanted
to check in on Hime.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI laughs] I guess
she's always been a bit of

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
a space cadet, huh?
That's my Hime.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
I don't know about that.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Maybe it's not
that she's spaced out.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's just more
like she's choosing

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
not to think about
things too much.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
Sometimes there are things in
this world you can't change,

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
no matter how much
you think about them,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Things you can't change

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
no matter how much
you think about them?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Maybe, when it comes to her mom,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
or my work, she just
chooses to ignore it.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
I suppose children have their
own way of escaping reality.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Finally, where
have you been all day?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Where's the broom?
I'm going to kill him.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
I'm so beat.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] We were supposed to
be on vacation, but this blows.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
Hey. This is still a
vacation, you guys!

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's gonna be
jam-packed with fun stuff!

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]
Hooray!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Yas! I can't wait
to wear my new swimsuit!

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
And I wanna eat until I die!

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
We should totally barbeque!

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Yeah! Just leave it to me!

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Wow. Life is cruel.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Okay. Yeah, please be careful.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
They ended Hime's
summer camp early,

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
and they all went
home this morning.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
Well, it is a typhoon.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
Why are you wearing
your swimsuit

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
in the middle of a storm?

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
Because I wanna get
my money's worth.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
It's pretty obvious that
one of us angered fate.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
Yeah, forget the ocean,
we can't even step outside.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
[AMI gasps]
The power!

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
[AOGU gasps]

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
And worse! My phone just died!

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
No TV, no games.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
No internet.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
Aw man, I'm so bored!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
Tell me about it, I read the
lame magazine in the bathroom

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
like a hundred times.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
You sound like spoiled brats.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
There are other ways to
pass the time, you know.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
Well, since you're
from the ice age,

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
how'd you pass
the time back then?

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Hm?
We'd talk about the wood grain

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
and how it looked
like famous people.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
Or what wrinkles in the curtains
looked the most like a hand.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
You guys should totally try it.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Uh, no.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
God, I'm so bored--
I can't take it anymore!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be
something to do!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
We have paper... and pencils.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
[pencil scraping]

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Huh? Oh. I thought
I'd draw some manga.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA gasps]
Same here!

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Us, too!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Let's draw!

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
I thought this was our vacation.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
I wanna draw, too!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] What's this?
What got into you guys?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
Everything about this
chapter is hilarious.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Oh? Just doing our jobs.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
[HIME] None of the kids
at camp liked my curry.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
They weren't a fan
of my seasoning.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
What? Like the taste?

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they said the
spiciness was too real.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
You know what I think?

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
No one makes curry
better than you do.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
That makes me happy.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
Why'd I bother hiring a
professional at camp?

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
She's choosing not to think
about things too much.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Listen, Hime?

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
Just know, if there's anything
you'd like to ask me, you can.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mmm...

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
What flavor is curry?

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
Huh? It's curry. So that
makes it curry-flavored.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, makes sense!

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
When she asks that stuff,

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
it makes me think she really
is just spaced out.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] She's here!
Hide the manuscripts!

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Get rid of the manga smell!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
Synergy and blah, blah, blah.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Then there's
innovation or whatever.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Compliance something-or-other.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
What's happening?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Disaster drill, obviously.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Yeah, what else could it be?

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
Hime finding out that
I'm a manga artist

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
would be a total disaster.
As such,

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
we conduct routine
drills on what to do

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
if she ever randomly
shows up here!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
How would I know that?

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
Well, better get used to it,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
cause he conducts
these annually.

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Let us reflect on
what we did wrong.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ami.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Yeah?

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you have drawn
the Hime mask to look cuter?

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
Are you for real?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
If you've got a problem,
why don't you draw it?

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Aw... No matter how hard I try,

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
I just can't capture Hime's
true cuteness. [laughs]

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Weirdo...

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Daddy! This is yummy.

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you like it.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Yeah!

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Man. She's so cute.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
Like I could ever
capture that in a drawing.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
I've gotta protect that smile.

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
She can never know the truth

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
that I actually draw
smut for a living.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps]

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
What's wrong?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
Uh... nothing!
Be right back princess.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
I swear to god
I'm gonna kill him.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hello?

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
Satsuki, you jerk!
Come see me.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Sorry, I can't.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
I'm actually on a
business trip in Hokkaido.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI yelps]

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] What the hell are
those monstrosities?

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.077 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
okaying those things!

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
Oh, those?

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
I didn't give an okay for
them either, no worries!

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
No, there are lots of worries!
Because they exist, fool!

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
Come on. No one
would have ever expected

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
<i>Tights in the Wind</i>
to get bootleg merch.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
Um. Nothing.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Go say something, editor.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Why me?

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
[GUY B]
Hmm?

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Uh. Hi. So, about
the masks you're selling.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
These things are so ugly I
haven't sold a single one.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Hey, great news for ya!

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
He says they're way
too ugly to sell!

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
That's cruel,
but not the problem here!

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This happens sometimes.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
A series can end up with
bootleg merchandise

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
even if it's not that popular.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
It's often because someone
happened to see the series

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
on the cover and mistook it
for something more important.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[GUY B]
Whoa, cool!

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Leading them
to think the series has

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
more of a following
than it actually does.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Never mind!
I'll go talk to him. Hey!

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
[GUY B growls]

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
I'll buy your whole stock.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Now take
responsibility by getting rid of
these!

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
Hi there, boss.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50% align:center
Yes. Perfect timing!
Don't let Hime see!

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
Can you take him and
hide them somewhere?

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
There you are.
What took so long?

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
Sorry, dear. So what would
you like to do next?

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
I want cotton candy!

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
Coming right up!

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
Here we are! Cotton candy.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
Just a sec, princess.
Gimme your whole stock.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
Hey, Aogu. Now talk
about perfect timing!

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Oh. Yo.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Take all of those home
without anybody seeing you.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
Come on!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
Here, give me all the
bullets you've got!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
Miss.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
Miss again. Close!

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
Just kidding. Miss.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
I sold all of those ugly masks,

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna make ten
times as many next year.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Same here, buddy!

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And though he had
no way of knowing

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
what he'd put in motion,

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Kakushi would be spending
ten times more money

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
at the next festival.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
I wonder why that's going off?

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
Is Hime here?

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Stay calm! Do
everything like we practiced!

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
Get rid of the manga stench!
Put away the equipment!

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
Disguise yourselves!

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
We're the public
safety commission.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh?

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A] We've received
reports that a group of people

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
were seen carrying in large
amounts of food and supplies,

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
as well as participating
in suspicious activities.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
Based on those reports,
we have reason to believe

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
this is the secret
hideout of a cult.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
Well when you put it that way,

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
I gotta admit it
sounds suspicious.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A] We'll just
take a quick look around.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Sure, I doubt you'll
find anything.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Why on earth do you have

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
all these bags of white powder
stuffed into your closet?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] To be fair,
it's not actually powder,

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
it's cotton candy.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
Why haven't you
eaten that already?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing, I
don't want to explode.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
This must be how they
make their money.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
Look through their computers
for any extra data!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
Right away, sir!

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
Uh-- No, don't look!

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
Uh, why not?

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
I had to search "How to
draw cute little girls"

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
for the Hime masks.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
It's very likely they'll
get the wrong idea.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY B]
Out of the way!

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Quickly! Help me!
Don't let them look!

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Listen, I would
really like you to leave.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I didn't want
to have to tell you,

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
but this is my studio for manga.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
I've never seen an art studio
with business charts before!

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Fair point.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY B] Sir, I found
something kind of weird!

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
Why do you have
women's tights here?

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
I use them for reference.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what kind of reference?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
Nothing special.
I wear them on my head.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
Do you plan to rob
a bank or something?

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
What, no way!

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY B]
Check out what else I found!

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A] You're definitely
going to rob a bank!

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It's not real, it's a model.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A]
And you have a sword?

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm telling you, it's
a prop we use for reference.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A] And now we've found
some sort of attack drone!

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] No! I bought that
thing when it first came out

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
because it looked cool!

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
Your absurd excuses
can't fool me!

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
You're planning to overthrow
the government, aren't you?

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
Oh no. I must have joined an
anti-social organization

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
without realizing it.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
Gotta admit it,
looks pretty shady.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
What if we're actually
just unsuspecting pawns

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
in a much larger game,

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
ignorantly laying the groundwork
for illegal activities?

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
We surrender.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
Go easy on us!

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
You guys. It's not like that.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
If you don't do something

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
you won't be able to
see Hime for a while!

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
But I bet they'll give
you a lighter sentence

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
if you just turn yourself in.

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
It was me! I did all of it!

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
All of what?

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
Listen. I swear he really
is just a manga artist.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? If that's the case,
where's your proof?

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.072 position:50% align:center
Okay, but just
prepare yourself.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasping]

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY A grunting]

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groaning]

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] I can't believe we were
just saved by a nudey pic.

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
It was a published nudey, so...

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I didn't notice
this at the festival,

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
but did I buy you this yukata?

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
No, it's handsewn.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
That's what the neighbor lady
said when I showed it to her.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Were you the one who
made it for me, Daddy?

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
Me?

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
Well, I found it in our closet.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[HIME] It was in the
ten-years-old box!

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
Did you look in any
of the other boxes?

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Just up until ten.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's how old
I am right now.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited,
it goes up to 16!

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
Daddy? Will you make me
a dress next?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
Huh? Me?
I, uh... Sure, why not?

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
Really? Can you sew anything?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
Like... Can you
make me some shoes?

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
Some shoes?

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Or sew me some glasses?

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
Glasses aren't something
you can really sew, Hime.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, I knew that!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
I just thought you could
because you're so amazing.

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
But you don't need them.
Your eyesight's fine.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
I meant fashion glasses!
You wouldn't understand, Daddy.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI laughs]

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
What brought this on?

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
Why'd you need me to
teach you how to sew?

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
No reason.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
Looks like she
finally found out.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
Were you the one who
gave her the key, Rasuna?

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Of course not. It's not
my place to give it to her.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
I'm just surprised he was able

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
to keep it a secret for so long.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Although... It's not
as if she tried to find out.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
[HIME] It was in Kamakura that I
discovered my father's secret.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
That he drew manga for a living.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
And I realized
something else, too.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
[HIME] My father may
have hid this from me,

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
but I also never
tried to uncover it.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Maybe, deep down, I was
too scared to know the truth.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
Because if I found
out about his job,

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
then I might discover
more things.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
Things I didn't want to know.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
And the happy life I shared
with him might disappear.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
[HIME] And then I found
some boxes, within a box.

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:50.138 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I have to be able to
run a hundred meters super-fast.

00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:52.098 position:50% align:center
Otherwise they'll know
I'm a manga artist!

00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:53.600 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Those involved
with the way of manga

00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:56.061 position:50% align:center
should only train their muscles
using the way of manga.

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:56.978 position:50% align:center
[MARIO]
Magnificent!
