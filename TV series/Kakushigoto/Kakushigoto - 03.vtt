Just beyond the path of stairs,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
inside the pandora's
box I had opened,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
there were even more surprises.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
They look like the ones
from my childhood.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.793 position:50% align:center
Wait. It's familiar.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.556 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
The layout of this house

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
is just like the home I
grew up in in Nakameguro.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.200 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] Whatcha....
Whatcha doin' there, Boss?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.787 position:50% align:center
Meditating. My spirit
has been exhausted lately.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.956 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping this will
help it recover.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you feelin' okay?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.793 position:50% align:center
Why the heck is your
arm in a cast?

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry, it's just
a lame little fracture.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.798 position:50% align:center
Oh, I will worry!
How will you draw?

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
Burned my hand.

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:55.968 position:50% align:center
--I got a stye.
--My tooth...

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
Did you guys plan this
to give me a heart attack?

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:06.103 position:50% align:center
[ATO] Hello there. Satsuki
sent me over to help out.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuma Ato. Nice to meet you.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
My, he's so polite!

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
[AMI] I can't believe Satsuki
did something useful.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.948 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Would you mind
doing this page for me?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.533 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.243 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] One of the most
important skills an editor

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
can possess is the ability
to find skilled assistants.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.001 position:50% align:center
Which is weird, because usually,
Satsuki is useless.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.003 position:50% align:center
I'm finished. Wanna take a look?

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
Wait. You're done already?

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.424 position:50% align:center
You're amazing!

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.886 position:50% align:center
[ATO] Work, work, work. Work,
work, work. Work, work, work.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.889 position:50% align:center
Hey, look! The new guy's
a real-deal artiste!

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.016 position:50% align:center
Sure is. Too much so.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.143 position:50% align:center
Why do you say that
like it's a bad thing?

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50% align:center
'Cause it is.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
Well, that didn't
last very long.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.319 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was only a matter of
time. He was too efficient.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
But it's okay. He was
my assistant, after all.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.033 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to have
fostered his talent.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.870 position:50% align:center
The Creator's profile
says he was an assistant.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
Working for Gosho Akayama
and Ken Aomatsu.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
Funny how he didn't
mention our studio.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:13.629 position:50% align:center
Well, he wasn't here
for that long.

00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:16.215 position:50% align:center
[SILVIA]
Is this your house, Hime?

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
[RIKO]
Weird, it looks kinda old.

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:22.638 position:50% align:center
Not to be rude, but...
are you poor?

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.182 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Huh? I've never
thought about it.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Saying it like that
doesn't make it less rude.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
But they don't even
have a second floor.

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
Listen Hina, not everyone lives
in a fancy condo like you.

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
Your door doesn't
have auto-lock?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
And you don't have a concierge?

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. What is that?

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
They can do lots of things,
like they cook or clean,

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.328 position:50% align:center
and make sure you're
taken care of or whatever.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I see. And they're
called a concierge?

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.541 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.793 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Hime, only
a rich snob would have one.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.963 position:50% align:center
Just forget about it, okay?

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.548 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.801 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN A] Ooh.
It's rare to find a one-story

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.636 position:50% align:center
in this day and age.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.973 position:50% align:center
It's nice to see them taking
care of such an old house.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean that house?

00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
It's actually pretty new.
Seven years ago,

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:13.856 position:50% align:center
the landowner brought me a
blueprint of an old one-story

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.942 position:50% align:center
house. Asked if I could
build one like it.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.279 position:50% align:center
the guy could have built
a much bigger house

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.531 position:50% align:center
with all that land
they've got here.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:25.284 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN A] Well, I imagine
it must mean something special

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
to him, then.

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.246 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI, HIME]
Num num time!

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.832 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.293 position:50% align:center
I was wondering why you put
such big chunks of meat

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
into our curry?
Why not fish cakes?

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:39.590 position:50% align:center
What? Don't you like meat?

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.842 position:50% align:center
I like it okay.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.177 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.737 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Why is September
so friggin' hot?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
I'm ho-- Whoa,
it feels like a sauna!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.161 position:50% align:center
Hime? What's wrong?
Please, say something!

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.455 position:50% align:center
Hi, Daddy. Welcome home.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
It's just that the floor
felt so nice and cool.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.877 position:50% align:center
I decided to lay down
on it for a while.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.171 position:50% align:center
Turn on the air conditioner!

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.591 position:50% align:center
What have I said about
playing with the vacuum?

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't cause trouble
for the housekeeper.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.640 position:50% align:center
The vouchers... Wait,
why didn't the housekeeper

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.350 position:50% align:center
come in today?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:35.062 position:50% align:center
Is a housekeeper the same
thing as a concierge?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
I just thought that we could
save our money a little.

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
I mean. Um...
We are poor, aren't we?

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.947 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Huh...?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.365 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
So I told them not to come
and cleaned up by myself.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.495 position:50% align:center
Hime, we are not poor.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.374 position:50% align:center
Plus, I make way more than the
average white-collared worker!

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean you're not
a white collared worker?

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Oh! Um. I definitely am.

00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.214 position:50% align:center
I make more than the
average guy, though,

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
because I'm in a sort
of leadership position.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.094 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
But our house is ancient.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.513 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
No! Our place is...

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.516 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry! You can
leave it all to me.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.269 position:50% align:center
If our lifestyle is
considered poor.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Well, then... I'll embrace it.

00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
Isn't fish cake curry good?

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.402 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Mm-hm.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, and the newspaper.
Can you start getting it?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
I read that it's super great for
cleaning the windows and glass.

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
It'll help save money.

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Um, sure. Sounds like
a good idea.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.833 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm all about saving money,

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.169 position:50% align:center
but hopefully she's
just playing around.

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:42.296 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] A lot of young
girls are like that.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.423 position:50% align:center
And she probably just
wants to be helpful.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
You know, kind of like
a mom from a movie.

00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
I mean, maybe? Still though...

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.972 position:50% align:center
She kinda skipped the
reliable mother phase

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
and went straight to
the old grandma part.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Uhh...

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.312 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
I'm so not poor!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.439 position:50% align:center
Wait, what am I missing here?

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.608 position:50% align:center
Manga artists have to deal
with the constant fear

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.859 position:50% align:center
that they could lose
all their money

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.903 position:50% align:center
once they're not
popular anymore.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
Especially ones like
our fearless leader

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
who get cancelled
after two chapters.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.326 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I prefer the term
"strategic retreat"!

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
Enough! Let's just focus
on the work we need to do.

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.624 position:50% align:center
Aogu! Backgrounds!

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.584 position:50% align:center
Why's your dumb arm
still broken?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
Bones take a long time to heal?

00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
But Ato's not here anymore!

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
You think I don't know that?
He got his own series.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
While I'm still here with
my arm stuck in a cast!

00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
I hope that stupid, overly
efficient brat runs into a wall

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.641 position:50% align:center
that crushes him, along
with his hopes and dreams!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.769 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm in despair! And
getting poorer by the minute!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Just take a deep breath.

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
I refuse to sit by and
watch you slip into poverty.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
I think it's time for Goto Pro
to join the IT revolution!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] We can get rid
of the old analog workspace

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.534 position:50% align:center
and make everything
completely digital!

00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:55.786 position:50% align:center
Drawing a pesky building
with a lot of details

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.956 position:50% align:center
becomes an easy task
thanks to the power of CG!

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.958 position:50% align:center
You can submit your
manuscripts online,

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.377 position:50% align:center
so you won't have to worry about
the editor asking you to redo

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
it because he accidentally
forgot it somewhere.

00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
Inking is done with
a single click!

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
And it's cleaner because you
don't use real erasers.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:12.845 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Ohhh...

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.513 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] That's how all the
up-and-coming manga artists

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
work now.

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:18.851 position:50% align:center
I knew it would
happen eventually.

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
Today we will enter
the digital age.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
But my job is to fetch
manuscripts.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:24.982 position:50% align:center
My job is to erase things.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] And now that's gonna
disappear forever!

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
Our jobs are going to be
outsourced to technology!

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So, just get a new skill set.

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Unrelated, when exactly
did Satsuki get here?

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
You can call me IT Goto.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.297 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] Let's practice the
basics to get used to things.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.840 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You've got it, Boss.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.176 position:50% align:center
[AMI]
They've somehow swapped roles.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
Oh. What's the status on that
rainy city background?

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.722 position:50% align:center
Did you find someone?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
I sure did! The word "manga"
is now international!

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:03.020 position:50% align:center
There's talented staff
not only in Japan,

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
but all around the world!

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
You can hire an artist
from almost anywhere

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:07.900 position:50% align:center
with the click of a button!

00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
With the power of technology,

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
Goto Pro has become
a global enterprise.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of impressed
you know all this.

00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
Hey. It looks like they've
uploaded the background.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:22.206 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Mm... So, um...
Where'd you find this person?

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.166 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
Indonesia.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.293 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm guessing that
a rainy city looks a bit

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
different over there.

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:33.509 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm home. Wait... What happened?

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
It's just a cut.

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:37.471 position:50% align:center
What have I told you about
playing with knives?

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm going to call
the housekeeper right now

00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
and change our service to daily.

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:43.477 position:50% align:center
[phone dialing]

00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
How about this?

00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.608 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, when they come by,

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
I'll have them make whatever
you want for dinner, okay?

00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:54.613 position:50% align:center
[HIME grunts]

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.615 position:50% align:center
Scattered sushi.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds good.

00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:03.497 position:50% align:center
What am I looking at, exactly?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.374 position:50% align:center
Scattered sushi.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, huh? Our
housekeeper is from Indonesia.

00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:10.671 position:50% align:center
I'm Nadila.

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What are the odds?

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.389 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Daddy, I really
wanna learn how to cook.

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I dunno.

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
Is it okay if I do
it with Nadila?

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
Pretty please?

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
Fine. Go ahead.

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:33.819 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Yes! I can't wait to make
something out of this book.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What book?

00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
[HIME] It was inside
the ten-years-old box.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.830 position:50% align:center
I figured since I found
it inside of that one,

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:49.251 position:50% align:center
the recipes might be okay
for a ten-year-old to make.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.253 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI gasps, laughs]

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.589 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Your cooking
will be great.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.924 position:50% align:center
I just know it.

00:11:56.008 --> 00:11:57.885 position:50% align:center
I'll try really hard!

00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] But promise me you'll
only cook with Nadila, okay?

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:02.264 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
'Kay!

00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
It's meat and potatoes!

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:11.315 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Uh... Whoa. It's a lot
different than I expected.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.986 position:50% align:center
[HIME, KAKUSHI panting]

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.616 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Isn't it so much fun
running together?

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.576 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
So fun.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI groaning]

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:29.917 position:50% align:center
[AOGU] You okay? You're
usually more on the ball?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.752 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] He's been running
in the morning.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.171 position:50% align:center
Apparently he's
taken up working out.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.506 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Oh, yeah?

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.926 position:50% align:center
Guess that explains the
new studio equipment.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
It's for the sports festival.

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Aren't you a
little old for that?

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean Hime's.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:48.644 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA] I get it, you just
wanna show off, don't you?

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.062 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it at all.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
Sometimes sports festivals ask
parents to participate.

00:12:53.482 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
And for that reason,

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:57.945 position:50% align:center
I have to be able to run a
hundred meters super-fast.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
Otherwise they'll know
I'm a manga artist!

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that'll be
their first thought.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] It will! What other
job could a person have

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.246 position:50% align:center
that would make them run
slower than snail snot?

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
I dunno like... A lawyer
or a voice actor?

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah, most magazine
editors don't exercise.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
Your job doesn't really matter.

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:20.676 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]
She can't find out!

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:25.264 position:50% align:center
I have to hide the truth
from her at any cost!

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:26.849 position:50% align:center
The only reason
I'm working out at all

00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
is to keep my job a secret.

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I'd never do another
sit-up again if I could help it.

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.273 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU] Ah, and the
truth comes out at last.

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.524 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
For what it's worth,

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.985 position:50% align:center
your manga helps me work
out my abs, for real.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.237 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm not sure what
to say about that.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.575 position:50% align:center
[AMI] Great idea! Work out your
abs by laughing at gag manga!

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:47.703 position:50% align:center
For your back muscles, scare
yourself with horror manga!

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
And for cardio exercise,
read romance manga!

00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
Then work out your
bicep muscles with

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.877 position:50% align:center
the special comedy issue
of <i>Monthly Asuka</i>

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
that has over 900 pages!

00:13:57.421 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
Those involved with
the way of manga

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.301 position:50% align:center
should only train their muscles
using the way of manga!

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:05.554 position:50% align:center
That's true. Most of our muscles
are trained by manga.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:08.974 position:50% align:center
They're like... Mangscles.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
We manga artists are
like physical monsters,

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
fighting our way through life in
nothing but our mangscle armor!

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:17.983 position:50% align:center
Not my best portmanteau.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.735 position:50% align:center
[AOGU]
Nah, not really.

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI grunts]

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.323 position:50% align:center
Is there something
the matter, sir?

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.325 position:50% align:center
There's a new character
that's a high school girl

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:29.578 position:50% align:center
who wants to become an idol.
But I can't draw her.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.163 position:50% align:center
If you're having
trouble drawing her,

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.916 position:50% align:center
it's probably because you
don't understand her.

00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Mm...

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.337 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
I'm home.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.756 position:50% align:center
Well hello there, sir.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
Why is there a high
school girl in my house?

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.593 position:50% align:center
You've got a fan.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.763 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
you found my place,

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
but take this and
leave immediately.

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:55.312 position:50% align:center
[NARU] What the heck?
I don't want this.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm? But you're a fan.

00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, Daddy.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.235 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Crap! It's all over!

00:15:01.318 --> 00:15:03.195 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Uh... I can explain!

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:07.908 position:50% align:center
Little Hime's a huge fan
of mine. My first ever!

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:11.787 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, it's true! She's
a super great singer!

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.539 position:50% align:center
[NARU] She was listening
to me the whole time

00:15:13.622 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
I was singing in
the park earlier.

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
So you see,
I'm an aspiring idol.

00:15:19.837 --> 00:15:21.088 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
An idol?

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
[NARU] But everyone I know
tells me I can't do it

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
and won't take me seriously.

00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Tell me
more about that.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.640 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you for real?

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.559 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Of course.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] So this is what
high school girls

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:46.572 position:50% align:center
who want to be
idols think about.

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
This is so wild.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.868 position:50% align:center
I can't believe he's actually
paying attention to me.

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.995 position:50% align:center
Thank you for talking
with me today.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:55.414 position:50% align:center
No, thank you for listening.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
[NARU] He's an adult. And he
cares what I think.

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
[RASUNA]
So, I was thinking.

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:07.009 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Go on.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
Instead of worrying
about a sports festival

00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
you may not participate in,
why don't you focus on

00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
the bento box. You know,
for Hime's lunch that day?

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.602 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
According to his face,
he hasn't considered that.

00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Come on, bentos are the only
thing anyone cares about.

00:16:23.192 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
[KAKERU]
What do you know how to make?

00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:27.154 position:50% align:center
Mostly just curry and gyoza.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Not bento material.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.621 position:50% align:center
Wonderful work!

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:38.874 position:50% align:center
It's so cute how you want to
make bentos for your daughter.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.292 position:50% align:center
People say I dote on her.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
But she's my pride and joy.
Look, her name is Hime.

00:16:44.213 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
Aw, she's adorable.

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:47.883 position:50% align:center
I'm raising her all on my own.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.927 position:50% align:center
It can be tough being
a single dad.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
I know how important it is
for a kid to have their mom.

00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:57.351 position:50% align:center
I uh, really appreciate you
taking the time to teach me.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
And I'm certain that when
you become a mother,

00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
your child will be
truly blessed.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI]
Is he... hitting on me?

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.490 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Oh look. Flowers!

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
They're so pretty.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
We'll take those, please.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
[KUMI]
Sure thing. Oh, Mister Goto!

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.248 position:50% align:center
Aren't they just lovely?

00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:22.376 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yes. Our home décor's
a bit on the boring side.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
I'm a single working dad.
It's the least I can do.

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.798 position:50% align:center
You're such a caring dad.

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.676 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Well, I still think Hime

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
would be better off with
a mother around.

00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:37.558 position:50% align:center
Maybe even one who
likes flowers, perhaps?

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
Uh. You think so?

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:41.228 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:44.106 position:50% align:center
Hime? She's gone! No! But where?

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.692 position:50% align:center
Here, take these flowers!

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.944 position:50% align:center
Hime!

00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:52.948 position:50% align:center
[KUMI] But in the complex
language of flowers,

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
the mum means "I love you."

00:17:55.534 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
[KUMI] Did he just...
tell me he loves me?

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.414 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hime!

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.124 position:50% align:center
Don't disappear like that!

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
But look at what I picked!

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:07.546 position:50% align:center
Flowers? Oh. Whoopsie daisy.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. Wanna put
those in a vase?

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
You sold my suit?

00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:22.019 position:50% align:center
But it very clearly said
"not for sale"!

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
[MARIO]
I can't exactly tell someone no

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
if they want to buy something.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.566 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
What am I supposed to wear home?

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:30.903 position:50% align:center
My cover story is that I
work at a strict office!

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
Now don't you worry.

00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
I'll hook you up with the best
suit in my shop as an apology.

00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
[MARIO]
Oh! Magnificent!

00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
Doesn't this strike
you as too formal?

00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
[MARIO] Pish posh, a little kid
can't tell the difference

00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:45.042 position:50% align:center
between a tux and a suit.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Guess that's true.

00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:49.213 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Tomorrow's the sports festival.

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
I got out of work early,
so I need to start

00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:54.343 position:50% align:center
preparing her bento
as soon as I get home.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.221 position:50% align:center
Hime, I hope you'll be happy.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.519 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] I'm sure that the
other families have mothers.

00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:06.939 position:50% align:center
I wonder if seeing them there
will make her feel lonely.

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:14.905 position:50% align:center
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get rained out.

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:18.951 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
Huh? You're looking sharp.

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm? Ah. Hello there.

00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the day.

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:27.084 position:50% align:center
Hey, perfect timing. Mind if
I run something by you?

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
Sure. Knock yourself out.

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Deep down in my heart, I believe
every family needs a mother.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO]
What? What, what, what, what?

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:40.389 position:50% align:center
Is he really... proposing?

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.974 position:50% align:center
No way! Come on.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
That's just crazy,
though he is wearing a tux.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.687 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.273 position:50% align:center
What else could it possibly be?

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to say.
When would we hold the ceremony?

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Eh?

00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, never mind.
I just had a case

00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:56.822 position:50% align:center
of the word vomit,
so I should go!

00:19:56.905 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
Give me some time to
think it over, okay?

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.119 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And then, the next day...

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Hime!

00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI, KUMI]
You can do it, Hime!

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.965 position:50% align:center
Um... Why are you guys here?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI, KUMI]
What do you mean? How silly.

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:20.012 position:50% align:center
You hit on me just the
other day, remember?

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
I did?

00:20:21.597 --> 00:20:22.973 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
On the plus side, at least
Hime won't be lonely today.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Go, Hime! Give it
everything you've got!

00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:34.193 position:50% align:center
Check it out,
I brought you a bento!

00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
And I brought you
some pretty flowers!

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[SHIOKOSHI, KUMI growling]

00:20:39.323 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Yeah! Go Hime!
You can do it! That's my girl!

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO] Why did that jerk even
bother proposing to me?

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:50.876 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
All right! She did it!

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN cheering]

00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Isn't it great
that all these people

00:20:53.504 --> 00:20:55.589 position:50% align:center
came to cheer for you?

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.175 position:50% align:center
Um, thanks, I guess.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.929 position:50% align:center
Try one of these, Hime!

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
Save room for some
of mine, too!

00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:04.932 position:50% align:center
Don't forget mine.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
Why exactly are you here?

00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.936 position:50% align:center
It's called fan service.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.314 position:50% align:center
It's turned into a pretty
lively lunch, huh?

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Eat however
much you want, okay?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKO growling]

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:23.534 position:50% align:center
Hey. Go easy on your old man.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
Are you mad or something?

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:31.500 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] Jeez, what's the
point of working out so much

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
if all you get is sore muscles?

00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:39.800 position:50% align:center
C'mon, wasn't it sort of fun
to have so many people

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
hanging around?

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.097 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Mm-hm! But...

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.557 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
But... it also would have
been fine if it was just us.

00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Huh?

00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:56.400 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI] And here I was
stressing about everything.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:22:00.112 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure whether
to be happy or sad.

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
[HIME]
Daddy, what are these muscles?

00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:03.991 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Back muscles.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.827 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Ah. So what do
you call this thingy?

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Hm... That's the back bone.

00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:10.998 position:50% align:center
[HIME] Or a funny bone!
Tickle, tickle...

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.376 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI laughing]
Hey! I've been had! Cut it out!

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
[HIME] ...tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle!

00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:50.222 position:50% align:center
[HIME] I was wondering,
are you any good at drawing?

00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:53.267 position:50% align:center
[NARU] My only complaint is your
art looks kinda like manga.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.268 position:50% align:center
[KAKUSHI]
Are you stupid?

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.979 position:50% align:center
[AMI, AOGU]
Shut up, you idiot!
