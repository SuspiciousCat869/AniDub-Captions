1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,000
[KOSAGI] Karasu and the
others disappeared?!

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,708
To be precise, I completely
deleted their data.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,958
Give me a minute while I
reconstruct the program.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,416
How could that occur?!

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,458
Yelling at me isn't
going to help much.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,916
Is he dead?
Tell me he isn't dead!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
[TOBI] Don't jump to any
conclusions, Kosagi.

8
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,750
And keep your voice down;
we really don't want

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,791
Haruka's mother to hear this.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,166
We're counting on you, so bring
our friends back already.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,458
Haruka will be okay, won't she?

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,750
[MIHO]
Atori...

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,875
[ATORI] Hmm? So what are
you looking at me for?

14
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,916
Do you think there's any chance
we'll get them back here?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,750
I don't know but I guess it
can't hurt to try, right?

16
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,750
Atori, stop talking like that!
We're all worried about them

17
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,208
and your bad attitude
certainly isn't helping us

18
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,875
deal with it any better!

19
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,666
Uh, Miho...!

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,083
If you're from the future too,

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,541
then how come
you're not helping?!

22
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,708
Idiot!

23
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,958
Atori?

24
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,791
I really don't have
the skills for that.

25
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,041
Huh?

26
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,958
Dimensional operations
are Tobi's expertise.

27
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,958
I would just be getting in
the way if I tried to help.

28
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, I guess that explains it.

29
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,458
Okay, Atori, you're forgiven.

30
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,125
You can come over
here by me now.

31
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,708
Alright, I will.

32
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,416
Dammit. He's up to something.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,333
He hasn't completely
reverted back yet.

34
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,500
[KOSAGI]
That may be, but--

35
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,583
So, you don't have
to worry about it.

36
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,958
What is it now?

37
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,791
It's really nothing.

38
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,041
I just have to hurry.

39
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,833
[YU] He called it by
the name "Shangri-la."

40
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,666
I wonder if this might
be another future for us.

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916
Another what?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,791
I don't really understand
it myself, but...

43
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,833
You know what, Karasu?

44
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,541
Maybe that guy who wears
the mask is really...

45
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,666
Alright, so just what are
we supposed to do now?

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,541
Looks like this fog is getting
a lot thicker all of a sudden.

47
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,416
It might be dangerous
to stick around.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,916
We should probably leave.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,541
I think you may be right.
I can barely make out a thing.

50
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,208
We need to get out of here, now.

51
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,208
Um, okay...

52
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,541
[YU]
C'mon, let's go, Haruka.

53
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey, stop! Wait a minute.

54
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,125
[YU] Hold on to my hand
so we don't get split up.

55
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
Oh, Karasu.

56
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,916
[HARUKA]
I can't see a thing.

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,041
[YU] If this gets worse,
we won't even be able to see

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,625
where we're going.

59
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,041
What you can see with your eyes
has no meaning in this place.

60
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,291
What d'you mean?

61
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,833
This entire dimension
is merely an illusion.

62
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,416
[YU]
An illusion, huh?

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,625
[KARASU]
For both of you, in this world,

64
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,416
your existence has yet
to be established.

65
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,000
[YU]
Sorry, I don't get it.

66
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,541
What's that supposed to mean?

67
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,708
[KARASU] This dimension is a
parallel dimension to La'cryma

68
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,708
which means it is the future
from your point of view.

69
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,208
The future?

70
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,541
It is but one of
several possible futures.

71
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,833
But even if this world is
an illusion, you're still here.

72
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,458
And so's Karasu.

73
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,083
And because you're
both here, I'm here too.

74
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,625
And I couldn't be happier.

75
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,958
I think it's completed.

76
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,916
[AI]
Whoa!

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,166
Tobi, does this represent
dimensional construction?

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm impressed,
Ms. Uchida, really.

79
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,958
The infinite number
of dimensions

80
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,083
that hypothetically exist
have a mutual link.

81
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,208
This graphic represents
that in real time.

82
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,833
It's the coordinates of
a particular dimension.

83
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,750
I can only make a
simplified version

84
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,833
with the calculating power
of the systems I have here,

85
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,166
but we should still be
able to use it to find out

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,916
whether Haruka exists.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,833
All I have to do is
input her data and...

88
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,083
That's her. She's alright;

89
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,500
Haruka definitely
still exists somewhere.

90
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,375
So where is she?

91
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,541
[TOBI] I believe...
that she's in Shangri-la.

92
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,166
[phone rings]

93
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,750
This is Uchida speakin'.

94
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,916
[MAYUZUMI] Nice to talk to you.
My name is Mayuzumi.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Dr. Mayuzumi?

96
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,791
[MAYUZUMI] I heard about you
from Professor Sasaki.

97
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,916
[UCHIDA]
Where are you right now, Doctor?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,166
[MAYUZUMI] I'm here in
the same town as you.

99
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,333
[UCHIDA]
What?

100
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,833
[MAYUZUMI]
Listen, can we meet right now?

101
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,541
There's something I need
to discuss with you.

102
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,958
It's important.

103
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,041
[KOORIYAMA]
Uchida, where are you going?!

104
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,416
[UCHIDA]
Ah, to talk to Dr. Mayuzumi!

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
I see something...

106
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,291
What is that?

107
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,083
[YU]
What's with this town?

108
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,666
Has it been abandoned?

109
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,208
This town is really
weirding me out.

110
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,625
[KARASU] This town doesn't
really exist. It's an illusion.

111
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,625
[YU]
Not that again.

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
[TIME DRIFTER]
Haruka...

113
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,458
[HARUKA]
Huh?

114
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,250
[TIME DRIFTER]
You must be very careful.

115
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:36,458
This is a wavering town, a place
where your soul will waver,

116
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,833
and judgement will be bent.

117
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:43,416
You musn't lose sight
of the future you desire.

118
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,458
Hey, are you okay?

119
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,041
What's wrong, Haruka?

120
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,208
[HARUKA]
Yeah... I'm okay...

121
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,916
She must be exhausted.
Let's take a break for now.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,541
That works for me.

123
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,458
[YU] It looks real.
There are rooms and everything.

124
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,000
[HARUKA] Do you think...
somebody lived here?

125
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,208
[HARUKA]
Not even a soul...

126
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
[YU]
This place should be safe.

127
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,583
Why don't you go lie down?

128
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,750
At least there's a bed in here.

129
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,541
Take care of yourself, Haruka.

130
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah...

131
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,291
[YU]
It's okay, just get some rest.

132
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,791
[HARUKA]
Mm-hmm...

133
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,708
[YU] So what's next?
What do we do now?

134
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,458
I knew it. You don't
have a clue, do ya?

135
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,333
We should rest while
there's still time.

136
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,000
[UCHIDA] They've progressed
further than I thought.

137
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,833
[KOORIYAMA]
So you think it's ready to go?

138
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,291
[UCHIDA] They're waitin'
for the green light.

139
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,083
So is that him?

140
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,833
That's him, let's go.

141
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,791
[UCHIDA]
Dr. Mayuzumi, I presume?

142
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,875
You must be Miss Uchida.
I guess the rumors were true.

143
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,958
I've read your dissertation
on the critical stages

144
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,208
of quantum potential.

145
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,083
You've outlined a very
interesting concept--

146
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,833
Doctor, the Magic
Circle Experiment

147
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,500
must be stopped at all costs!

148
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,958
I know, it's just... well, I--

149
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,250
If a massive enough quantity
of the theta particles

150
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,750
generated from the
Magic Circle becomes linked,

151
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,291
there is the
distinct possibility

152
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,833
that a powerful place
sight will be generated.

153
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,875
That phenomenon is something
that can only occur

154
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,625
if it goes critical.

155
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,666
Please look at this.

156
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,500
This contains a map of this
region's quantum potential.

157
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,333
As you can see, this region
is exhibitin' the aspects

158
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,000
of a quantum waver.

If it reaches
a phaser criticality,

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,750
a dimensional contact
interference would occur.

161
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,833
That would mean
that all dimensions,

the entire universe,
may be wiped out.

What makes the quantum
potential of this region unique?

There is the possibility
that the existence of Haruka

Mankind is the root

that Haruka is
in Shangri-la now.

198
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,375
There are signs
of her existence,

lock down which dimension.

Whichever one she's in,
it's in a state of instability.

201

I believe it's safe to say that
they transported to Shangri-la

202
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,333
because the dimension is in
a state of de-coherence.

The result should get

safety of your only child?!

316
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,041
[ASUKA]
Excuse me?!

317
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,041
What do you think gives
you the right to--

318
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,916
[ASUKA]
We're doing it again, aren't we?

319
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,875
It's so horrible. I suppose
old habits really die hard.

320
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,083
I guess I take back
what I just said.

321
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,291
You have changed quite a bit.

322
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,125
You've become a lot calmer.

323
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,333
So what's wrong?

324
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,291
I feel it's my duty to
protect the two of you.

325
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,250
Asuka. The next time we meet,
let's go to that park again

326
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,375
like we used to with Haruka.

327
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,500
I'll call you
again soon. I promise.

328
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,125
[KARASU] The Haruka of
my world became a part

329
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,041
of the quantum computer.

330
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,416
In your dimension, that will
occur in about 10 years.

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,666
Why does it happen to her?

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,625
[KARASU]
That was what Haruka desired.

333
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:17,666
[KARASU] She sacrificed herself
for the existence of La'cryma.

334
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,333
Haruka was chosen
in an effort to stop

335
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,250
the takeover from Shangri-la.

336
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,625
She became the wall,

337
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,416
which prevented erosion
from other dimensions.

338
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,375
She did it for the "Limes,"
the dimensional barrier

339
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,833
created by the quantum computer.

340
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,250
She became the human sacrifice

341
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,416
that saved La'cryma
from destruction.

342
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I... let Haruka die.

343
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,333
So in the future...

344
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,958
[HARUKA]
That me in La'cryma...

345
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,416
She was smiling, right?

346
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,208
[KARASU]
Haruka!

347
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,833
So I guess the me in La'cryma
also loved you, Karasu.

348
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
That right?

349
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,958
She didn't do it for everyone.
She did it for you, Karasu.

350
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,625
[NOEIN]
That's right.

351
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,333
Haruka from all
dimensions will disappear.

352
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,208
Get away, now!

353
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,458
Yu!

354
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,958
[NOEIN]
Die, you scum!

355
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,416
What are you doing?!

356
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,833
[NOEIN]
Oh, Haruka...

357
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,458
[HARUKA] They have nothing
to do with this, right?!

358
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,416
So if I were to go with you...

359
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,625
[NOEIN] That's true. If it is
your wish, I will not harm them.

360
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,041
Ha... ruka...

361
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,416
[NOEIN] You and I together
will unite all dimensions,

362
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,750
and give birth
to the true world.

363
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:24,375
Haruka, your existence
can save everything.

364
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,625
Including my friends here, both?

365
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,750
Promise me that you'll send them
back to their own dimensions.

366
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,000
[NOEIN]
If that is your wish...

367
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,375
Don't do it... Haruka...

368
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,458
[NOEIN] You have made
the correct choice.

369
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,416
Let go of her!

370
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,166
Damn you! Bring her back!

371
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,166
Keep your promise!
Send them back, right now!

372
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,208
[NOEIN]
A promise indeed! So true!

373
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,875
But you know something, Haruka?

374
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:46,250
You will soon forget
all about them.

375
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,750
[NOEIN] Please realize the world
is a chain of unhappiness,

376
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:56,125
and that you are the
first link in that chain.

377
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,041
[AI] Do you think
Miss Uchida and the others

378
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,750
have a plan in the works?

379
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,500
I hope they came up with one.

380
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,833
[MIHO] Atori, Tobi hasn't
come back yet.

381
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,958
Just be patient.

382
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,250
[MIHO]
Yeah, but--

383
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,875
What's happening?

384
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,416
What was that?!

385
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,833
[ATORI]
Come here!

386
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,833
Here, grab on!

387
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,250
What in the hell's goin' on?!

388
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't like this.

389
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,541
Tell me you know
what's goin' on!

390
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,458
What just happened?!

391
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,458
It's gone!

392
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,166
[NOEIN]
Perfect...

393
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,625
It can't be! My house!

394
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,250
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

395
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,041
That summer day's dream.

396
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,375
How can you tell that
the future is miserable?

397
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:13,416
[NOEIN] So then, why don't you
return them to their world?

398
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,375
[ATORI] Everyone is waiting,
you're not alone.

399
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,583
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "To the Future."

400
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,833
Can you find a happy one?
