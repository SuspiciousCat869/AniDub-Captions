[KUINA] We will capture
the Dragon Torque

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,250
and return to La'cryma.
Tobi, can you do it?

4
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,833
[TOBI]
I'll try.

5
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,291
Unfortunately, it will
create a massive strain

6
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,166
at the time of transposition,
but I think I can do it.

grab the Dragon Torque.

What?

[TOBI]
It's... It's Shangri-la.

It's some kind of floating mask?

burned through with a laser.

help him escape from his house?

They were standing super close

and talking all
hush-hush and serious.

Oh, that is a big deal.

122
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,291
I tell you!

123
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,208
I was just shocked!

124
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,958
What's so shocking about it?

125
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
Well I'll tell you, I've done
an enormous amount of research!

126
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,125
I used horoscopes to
check my compatibility

127
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,625
with our classmates.

128
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,375
And according to each and every
one of those star charts,

129
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
Isami and I are perfect matches.

130
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,666
Whatever.

131
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,333
[MIHO]
Okay, but that's not all.

132
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,208
Then I checked Haruka
and Isami's compatibility.

133
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,791
[AI]
What? You did what?

134
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,208
[MIHO] Exactly. But guess what
it said... Surprise, surprise!

135
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,291
They're even more
of a perfect match.

136
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,625
[AI]
Wow.

137
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
[MIHO] And I am sure
Haruka reads that horoscope

138
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,875
every day, too.

139
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,583
Have you noticed how Isami
acts all weird around her?

140
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,375
It's embarrassing.
He's so obviously

141
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,833
projecting beams of love.
I can't believe it!

142
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,083
[ISUKA] Find the Dragon
Torque and... destroy it.

143
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,291
We cannot do that.
We were given strict orders

144
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,208
to secure the Dragon Torque
and bring it here.

145
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,541
Not to destroy it.

146
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,833
[ATORI]
It is too dangerous.

147
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,875
I can tell.

148
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,875
She is what caused
this screwed up dimension.

149
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,083
That's why we have
to destroy her.

150
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:32,250
If we don't, this entire
universe will be obliterated.

151
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,791
La'cryma is certainly done for.

152
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,916
And the Dragon Torque
is done for as well.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Decide. You can either come
and keep fighting with me...

154
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,666
...or stay and die.

155
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,166
[HARUKA]
What's wrong, Ai?

156
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,541
Oh hi, Miho. I didn't know
you were here, too?

157
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,250
[MIHO] So you and Isami were
just having a friendly chat

158
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,750
over at your place?

159
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,416
[HARUKA] Isami? Yeah,
but how'd you know that?

160

patch things up.

317
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,416
[ASUKA] Just think about it,
honey. It's silly to lose

318
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,166
a friend over something
that's probably trivial.

319

Baron... what do you
think I should do?

320
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,375
Mom thinks I should
probably apologize to her.

321
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,666
Did I do something wrong
that would make Ai

322
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,333
so incredibly mad at me?

323
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,541
[HARUKA] I don't understand
what started it.

324

[HARUKA]
Huh?

325
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,416

This is a vision of something

that is in one of your futures.

Where is it?

It's gone. I've lost it forever.

00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,166
This is the future?

333
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:58,541
I've lost the cell strap, and
I've lost my very best friend.

334
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,500
The cell strap?

335
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,250
The strap from the cell phone.

I've had it!

I totally hate you, Haruka.

Hey, Ai, want some?

What's wrong with you?

You know you're not supposed
to bring candy to school.

Ha! You know you
can't resist chocolate.

No you're not!

Haruka, get over here. Grab the
candy bar! Go on, hurry!

00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,458
Ai, don't bully him,
it's not polite.

Okay, okay, don't
break it, come on.

I'm going out for a minute!

It's exactly what I saw...

No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

I've been acting like a jerk.

I'm really sorry, Haruka.
Will you forgive me?

Of course I forgive you, Ai.
