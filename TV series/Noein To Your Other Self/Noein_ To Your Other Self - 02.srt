00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,375
Oh crap, my right arm
didn't make it.

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,625
[KUINA]
Isuka, up here.

00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,416
Kosagi. Tobi.

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,958
Kosagi. Status report.

6
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,083
The coordinates that
Atori and Karasu

7
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,833
jumped to are slightly off.

8
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,583
Fukuro can't be confirmed.

00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,166
[KOSAGI gasps]
Koina, your arm!

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,250
[KUINA] Yeah, it's gone.
And my communicator's lost too.

11
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,625
Tobi, put a marker
on this dimension.

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,708
[TOBI]
Understood.

[TOBI grunts]

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,500
[KUINA]
This dimension is unstable.

15
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,500
[KARASU] You see, there is
nothing at all that you can do

16
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,666
to protect the young lady.

17
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,291
Just who are you?

18
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,916
You see... I am you.

[KARASU]
Ignore him!

22
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,166
[HARUKA]
Huh?

23
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,083
I know you.

24
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,416
I know who you are.

25
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,125
[HARUKA]
This can't be real, can it?

26
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:31,375
[ATORI] So, apparently the
Dragon Torque is a human.

27
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,625
Atori...

[ATORI cackling]

29
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,833
[ATORI]
I found it first, Karasu.

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,125
I found the Dragon Torque.

31
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,666
What? Dragon Torque?

32
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,458
[ATORI]
I'll transport her.

33
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,083
[KARASU]
Wait, Atori!

34
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,875
There's a possibility
the Dragon Torque

35
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,250
can't withstand the
shock of transposition.

36
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,500
[ATORI] I don't need the whole
body. An arm would do nicely.

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
[ATORI] I'll just take
a piece of her back with me.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,166
[HARUKA gasps]

39

[ATORI gasps]

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,458
I don't think
that's a good idea.

41
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,875
[ATORI] Are you planning to
monopolize all the glory again?

42
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,666
[KARASU] Don't act on
your own until we can

43
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,375
establish communication
with Kuina.

Entropic phenomenon

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,083
The dimension
is starting to waver.

49
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,083
[KUINA]
What's the cause?

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,375
[KOSAGI]
I believe it's the effects

51
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,250
from the stimulant reaction
of the hyperspin.

52
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,875
[KUINA]
Spin weaponry was deployed

53
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,416
in this dimensional world?

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,125
[KOSAGI]
We have to stop it now, Kuina,

55
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,166
or a matter violation
will occur.

What's that?

know it... has stopped.

Hell.

61
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,458
[KARASU]
You have to stop.

62
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,958
A dimensional resonance
phenomenon is occurring.

63
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,916
[ATORI]
Heh. Karasu... I detest you.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,083
Or maybe you didn't know that.

65
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,583
If you were to simply disappear,

66
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,208
all I would have to say is that
you were flung somewhere

67
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,750
in time and space during combat,

68
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,500
and no one would be
the wiser... I'm sure.

69
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,041
Get it?

70
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,125
Ah!

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,291

[KARASU]
Fukuro, are you in one piece?

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,166
There was an error in
the transposition coordinates.

80
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,541
[FUKURO] So did you locate
the Dragon Torque?

Mm-hm.

Is that... little girl
the Dragon Torque?

I'm really not sure.

[MIHO]
Oh... how come?

102
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,500
[AI] Because you'll
confuse everything.

But that was a ghost, wasn't it?

[VOICE 1] The bird's
dimensional transposition

116
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,291
doesn't seem to stabilize.

117
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,000
[VOICE 2] The probability
of success is increasing.

118
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,458
There's no need to worry.

119
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,916
[VOICE 3] However, there are
only seven birds left now.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,166
[VOICE 2] It is possible to
secure the Dragon Torque

121
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,833
with only one bird.

122
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,791
Besides, birds who actually saw
the Dragon Torque survived.

123
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,166
[VOICE 3]
The Dragon Torque exists

124
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,708
in a stabilized dimension.

125
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,500

Its existence is definite.

126

There is no mistake.

127
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,666
[VOICE 1] If we can obtain
the Dragon Torque,

128
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,083
we can prevent Shangri-la from
corroding our civilization.

129
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,375
[VOICE 3] Can the Dragon
Torque really be captured?

130
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,000
[VOICE 2] If we fail,
then our world, La'cryma,

131
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,458
will cease to exist.

132
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:24,875
[FUKURO] That dimension exists
15 years ago on the time axis.

133
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,708
Apparently that world is...

134
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,791
...very similar to
our past, my friend.

135
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:41,291
[FUKURO] The dimension...
where you and I

136
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,291
and she exist together.

137
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,708
It's ironic.

138
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,041
[KARASU] All we have to do
is fulfill our roles:

139
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,916
Stabilize the dimension
under the order of Reizu.

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,416
That's our duty
as Dragon Knights.

141
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,416
[FUKURO]
Enough, Karasu!

142
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,125
We will never be controlled
by anybody ever again.

143
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,125
I don't need the responsibility.

144
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,625
Then what's the point?
Why do it?

145
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,166
My friend... good question.

146
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,500
Maybe I just want
to dream again...

147
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,083
...like I did in the old days.

148
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,208
[HARUKA]
What was all that?

149
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,666
Am I going crazy?

150
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,541
[HARUKA] Still... I wasn't
dreaming. It was real.

No way! I'll be late!

What are ya talkin' about?

00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,333
It's your own fault
for sleeping in!

but I'm gonna be late!

00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,708
[AI] Alright! So wait up!
[HARUKA] No can do!

162
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,583
[AI] For crying out loud.
You're as fast as a dog.

163
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,083
[HARUKA] I'm not a dog!
[AI] I know that.

164
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,083
You okay, Ai? What's the matter?

165
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,916
[AI gasping, panting]
No... I might die.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,125
[AI]
I'm dead.

167
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,125
Oh, hey, don't damage it.
That's my car.

168
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,625
[AI]
Sorry about that, Miss Yukie.

169
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,708
[MIHO]
Uh-oh, the roof is dented.

170
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,250
[YUKIE]
No way!

171
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,375
[YUKIE]
A ghost? I gotta tell you girls,

172
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,083
that's really amazing.

173
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,958
You don't believe us! Do you?

174
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,416
[YUKIE]
Of course I believe you!

175
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,083
[HARUKA] You shouldn't talk
with your mouth full.

176
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,166
That was definitely
the real thing.

177
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,416
We finally saw one! Right?

178
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,333
Yeah. That's right.
Isami was really freaking out

179
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,208
about it grabbing his leg.

180
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,916
Impossible.

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,250
Oh? I don't think
it's a good idea

182
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,541
for you all to go out
at night by yourselves.

183
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
Don't you worry about us.

184
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,916
[HARUKA]
Yeah, 'cause we're fast runners.

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,958
That's not the point, Haruka!

186
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,708
She's right. But now
that you mention it,

187
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,458
I heard something similar.

188
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,750
[AI] Are you kidding?
[MIHO] Really?

189
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,500
Miss Yukie, please tell me!

190
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,916
Alright. Apparently,
my mother heard it

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,375
from a lady in
the neighborhood...

192
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,833
[YUKIE]
One appeared in Hachibanzaka.

193
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,625
It was an evil spooky spirit
with one arm gone!

194
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Only one arm?

195
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,375
That's similar to the one
that we saw last night!

196
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,000
Amazing! The town is
overflowing with ghosts!

197
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,125
[MIHO] Wow, that means
there's a chance...

198
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
Hey you guys.

199
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,958
[MIHO]
I can't wait!

200
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,916
I want you to go straight
to cram school today.

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,250
[YU]
I know.

202
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,333
I know you can be accepted
by the university.

203
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,291
[MIYUKI] It's okay. You're smart
enough to get into Tokyo Uni--

204
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,875
Don't even say that.

205
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,875
[MIYUKI gasps]

206
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,166
I don't wanna do any exams.

207
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,333
I won't go to Tokyo.

208
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,833
I'll decide my
own future, understand?

209
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,375
What are you tallking about?

210
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,750
You can still
decide your future.

211
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:47,333
You really cannot
do it. You can't.

212
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,375
Yu, listen.

213
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,333
I'm the one who knows
what's best for you, and--

214
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,291
No!

215
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,125
[MIYUKI gasps]

216
00:14:55,208 --> 00:15:02,625
[YU grunting yelling]

217
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,416
[door slams]

218
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,625
Hello, Yu.

219
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,458
[ISAMI] Yu! Hey, wait up!
What's with the sleeping bag?

220
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,208
You goin' camping?

221
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,416
You're not running away
from home, are you?

222
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,791
Yeah, as if.

223
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,458
It's for study camp, right?
Man, how lame is that.

224
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,458
You're gonna wear a
victory headband all day.

225
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,333
I will do homework!
I'll pass my classes!

226
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,666
[chanting]
Study! Success! Study! Success!

227
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,625
I don't...

228
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
[ISAMI] When are you gonna
quit that cram school, man?

229
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,666
You're really going to
have a breakdown

230
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
if you don't cut it out.

231
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,625
[ISAMI] Let's start playing
soccer together again.

232
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,375
You were on the team
last year. What happened?

233
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,666
[YU] I'm not...I'm not nearly
as good a soccer player as you.

234
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,166
You don't have to take
everything so seriously.

235
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,416
Just enjoy it, that's all.
Have some fun.

236
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,458
You wouldn't understand anyway!

237
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,791
Hey, hold on there!

238
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,791
[YU]
Just shut up!

239
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,916
Why, you!

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
[YU grunting]

241
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,208
Do you do everything
your mother says?

242
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,416
Quit being a wuss!

243
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,541
You're wrong! I'm not
like that. Get off!

244
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,708
Oh yeah, then tell me I'm wrong!

245
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,666
[YU] Someone like you...
[AI] Look, it's Yu and Isami.

246
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,250
It's Yu!

247
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,666
[HARUKA]
Hey you guys, knock it off.

248
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,125
[AI]
Stop it. What are you doing?

249
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,083
Cut it out, Isami!

250
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,208
You okay?

251
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,500
Damn! What is wrong with you?

252
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,208
[AI]
Isami...

253
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,875
[AI groans]
That boy has a problem.

254
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:20,250
[HARUKA] That backpack... are
you running way from home, Yu?

255
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,791
Hey, don't follow me.

256
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,166
But we promised that we
would run away together.

257
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,875
You certainly don't
have any reason

258
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,625
to run away from home!

259
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,500
[YU] Sure, maybe your dad
doesn't live with you,

260
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,750
but your mother
trusts you, doesn't she?

261
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,000
Your father cares
about you, doesn't he?

262
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,375
You don't know
how lucky you are.

263
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,000
It's different in my house.
It's all fallen apart.

264
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,500
[YU] Even when it comes to my
well-being... she talks like

265
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,916
she cares, but she doesn't
actually care inside.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,666
[HARUKA]
You know that's not true.

267
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,125
Yes it is. You know
I'm telling the truth.

268
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,708
[HARUKA]
Let me come with you.

269
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,916
Huh?

270
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,791
We made a promise.
Don't you remember?

271
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,083
To run away
from home together...

272
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,291
What do you say? We can go
anywhere you wanna go.

273
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,541
[YU]
What are we doing here anyway?

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,416
[HARUKA] After all,
if we're running away,

275
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,708
we won't be coming
back for a while.

276
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,250
So let's enjoy this
last look at the city.

277
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,500
Be careful, Yoshi!

278
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,125
Okay!

279
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
Hey Mommy, over here!

280
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,041
[YOSHI]
Come on, hurry!

281
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,000
[YOSHI]
It's really high up!

282
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,708
You could almost touch
the clouds. You should see it.

283
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,791
[MOM]
Really?

284
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,541
[YOSHI]
Yeah! The cars look like ants.

285
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
[MOM]
Really? I wanna see too.

286
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,291
[YOSHI]
Okay.

287
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,666
[YU]
One last look, huh?

288
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,791
[HARUKA] It looks like
the coast is clear.

289
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,291
[YU]
Now what?

290
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
Let's stay right here tonight.

291
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,208
[YU]
What? Stay here?

292
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,333
Why not? We have
no other place to go.

293
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,833
Yeah, but still...

294
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,000
[HARUKA] You know... I'm gonna
borrow your sleeping bag.

295
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,083
I'm feeling kinda tired.

296
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,250
You're crazy.

297
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,666
[YU] What happened yesterday
wasn't a dream, right?

298
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,250
You saw him too.
Well didn't you?

299
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,750
He wasn't an hallucination.
And he wasn't a ghost.

300
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,541
Yu...

301
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,750
He mocked me. He said
I couldn't do anything.

302
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,166
I can't get that out of my head!

303
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,958
You really can't
do it. You can't.

304
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,000
Yu...

305

307
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,666
[YU]
Do you hear that?

308
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,708
Someone... someone's here.

309
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,791
Yu!

310
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,458
Can you hear that?

311
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,583
What... What is that?

312
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,708
What the hell is that?

313
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,208
[YU whimpers]

314
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,166
What's going on?

315
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,458
This can't be right.

316
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,041
[HARUKA]
You see them too?

317
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,625
Yeah. I see lots
of people everywhere.

318
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,625
[YOSHI]
Hurry up!

319
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:40,250
That's the boy we saw
when we were here earlier.

320
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,833
[YOSHI]
Hey Mommy, over here!

321
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,708
It can't... It can't be real.

322
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,916
We're seeing some
kind of optical illusion.

323
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,291
[SCARY VOICE] That is neither
a mirage nor an illusion.

324
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,625
It is dimensional resonance.

325
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,125
[HARUKA]
Who's there?

326
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,708
[SCARY VOICE] The past and
the future have not separated.

327
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,958
Similar to an Uroboros. 

328
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,833
What's that?

329
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,500
What was that you said, Haruka?

330
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,750
[SCARY VOICE] The beginning
passes from the ending

331
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,083
to once again be the beginning.

332
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,875
[SCARY VOICE]
To find the one who will become

333
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:21,750
the absolute observer
in order to exist...

334
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,750
What'd you say?

335
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,750
I can't hear you now!

336
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,041
[HARUKA]
Yu...

337
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,458
[HARUKA gasps]

338
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:45,916
[ISUKA grunting]

339
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,333
Are you alright, Tobi?
Or did you get hurt?

340
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,125
[TOBI]
I'm okay.

341
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,208
Were the site
coordinates off again?

342
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,833
[ATORI cackling]

343
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,708
I am in luck.

344
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,333
I am the closest one to her.

345
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,916
[ATORI]
I'll get the Dragon Torque.

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,416
[ATORI cackles]

347
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,125
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again.

348
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,291
That summer day's dream...

349
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,583
Don't! Please, stop!

350
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,791
I can't! I can't do it!

351
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,500
[ATORI]
I won't let you go.

352
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:23,833
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "Hunted."

353
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,875
Someone... save me.
