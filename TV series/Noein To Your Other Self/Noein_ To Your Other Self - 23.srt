1
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,833
You died and left me
all alone, didn't you?

2
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,541
[NOEIN] That's right...
My Haruka is dead.

3
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:32,500
She died right in front of me
in the summer when we were 17.

4
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,291
[AI]
Haruka!

5
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,541
[ISAMI]
Where are you guys? Yu?

6
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,333
[MIHO]
Hey, come on out!

7
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,791
Yeah! Where are you?!

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,208
Hey, Ai!

9
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,083
No! You must leave here!

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,083
I think I heard her,
it was her voice!

11
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,625
Where are you?! Come on, now!

12
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,541
We've come for you,
let's go home! Haruka!

13
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,958
I'm sorry, I can't...

14
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,541
[ISAMI]
What is that thing?

15
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,666
[AI]
That's not a rainbow...

16
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:44,833
[ATORI] The Uroboros. It's bad.
We are in grave danger.

17
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong, Atori?

18
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,916
You should go inside the house.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,958
[MIHO]
Oh.

20
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,166
What's the deal
with that?! We can--

21
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,500
[ATORI]
Be quiet! I said go inside!

22
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,083
This dimension is an
illusion to all of you!

23
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,000
It simply doesn't exist.

24
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,708
There's only one thing real
to you in this dimension,

25
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,416
and it's that
damned house there!

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,625
Fine! What about our friends?!

27
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,458
Yeah! We are not gonna
leave 'em behind!

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,208
Stop fighting me on this!

29
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,541
You kids are still too
young to understand.

30
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,041
[MIHO]
Atori...

31
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,666
We can't just leave
our friends behind

32
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,541
and only try to save ourselves.

33
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,458
[JILL]
Run, Atori...

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,833
[JILL]
Run for it... They'll get you...

35
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
[ATORI]
No, I can't just leave you.

36
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,666
You have to go...

37
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,833
[ATORI] We all swore we'd run
away down south together.

38
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:44,583
If we all make it, we won't have
to freeze to death anymore.

39
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,250
And then the adults will
never hurt us again.

40
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,833
We can all live by ourselves.
Remember that, Jill.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,750
[ATORI yells]

42
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,708
[ATORI screams]

43
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,208
[ATORI]
Come on now, guys.

44
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:16,458
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one, yes?

45
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,875
I swear I will
find your friends.

46
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,541
Send them back. Send them back!

47
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,666
[ISAMI] Oh, man, that
was weird. Are you alright?

48
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,291
What the heck just happened?

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,083
Felt like an earthquake.

50
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,083
[MIHO]
Atori, what was that?

51
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,916
Haruka.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,625
Amazing. Simply amazing.
You truly are the best.

53
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,708
I'll never trust you!
You lied to me!

54
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,416
[NOEIN]
You and I will become one.

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,041
To resolve my sorrows,
I need you.

56
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,000
Check out all that
stuff up there.

57
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,125
That's impossible!

58
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,250
[ATORI]
This is really bad...

59
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,166
I think the dimensions
are converging.

60
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,083
This can't be!

61
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,375
[KARASU] The dimensional
convergence has begun.

62
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,083
[YU]
The dimensional convergence?

63
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,375
Noein has begun to use Haruka's
power to complete his goal.

64
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,166
What are her powers?

65
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,833
We need to get to her soon.

66
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,708
Haruka...

67
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,750
[YU]
Karasu, over there!

68
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,333
What's going on? Karasu?

69
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,000
It's starting now.
Don't be afraid of them.

70
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,958
Think only of Haruka.

71
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,875
You understand? Concentrate,
and the path will lead to her.

72
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,291
Turn me loose! I gotta go, now!

73
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
[ISAMI]
Damn!

74
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,166
[AI]
No, don't!

75
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,500
Haruka is trying to send
you all back to your world.

76
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,666
She's what?

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,875
Hey, we can just
leave 'em! We gotta help!

78
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,958
I swear to you that I will bring
them back safely, alright?

79
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,000
Then I'm staying right here!

80
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,416
Come on. Can't you
trust me, just a little?

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,333
[MIHO]
Atori?

82
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,458
I... hope you find your sister.

83
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,458
She died a long while ago...

84
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,458
What?!

85
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,791
She stepped on a land
mine and got blown up.

86
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,625
That wasn't right.

87
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,416
Don't you children
make the same mistake.

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,583
Take care.

89
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,000
[MIHO]
Ah, wait!

90
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,333
Where are you going?

91
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,041
Sorry, but I can't
predict the future.

92
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,500
But you know, it's interesting

93
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,041
because we don't know
what happens next.

94
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,708
You kids play nice.

95
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,041
Well, now. I guess
I'll have to go find

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,708
that sorry-looking loser.

97
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,375
[NOEIN]
You sent them home?

98
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:38,750
But I was going to integrate
them into this dimension.

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,333
You have always brought
me nothing but grief.

100
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,875
I did?

101
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,208
The you in every
single dimension

102
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,916
brings the me in every
dimension nothing but sorrow.

103
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,000
They're coming!

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,791
[YU]
They're going to land, Karasu!

105
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,625
They're encircling us.

106
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,791
What's going on?

107
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,125
What the heck are those things?

108
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,791
And how come they
keep getting bigger?

109
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,041
They're reacting to
our emotional status.

110
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,875
Huh? They're reacting to us?

111
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,000
Noein wills this.

112
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,458
He's ticked off because we're
trying to save Haruka, right?

113
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,875
I will take care of these
things. You go after Haruka!

114
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,875
Myself?

115
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,458
You will do it. Go.

116
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,583
[OPERATOR 1] Position fixed
on vessels 1 through 6.

Deploy radiator panels.

122

Do it already!

[OPERATOR 3]
All vessels.

[SHINOHARA cackles]

125
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,916
[SHINOHARA]
And now, we have taken

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,041
the first step towards history!

127
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,708
Can you understand
my sheer excitement?!

What's wrong?!

00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,750
Don't worry about us!
Go on, get going!

133
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,250
I'm so sorry, but we're
unable to go on...

00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,333
Why, Tobi?!

135
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,625
Our existence is
beginning to be erased

00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,291
by the wavering of the
quanta in the Magic Circle.

[KOORIYAMA, UCHIDA gasp]

[TOBI] I'm afraid you'll
have to go on without us.

139
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,041
[KOORIYAMA]
Come on, let's go.

140
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,500
We have to trust
they'll get it done.

141
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,375
[YU]
Now what?

142
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,958
[THE OTHERS]
We committed a grave error.

143
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,791
[YU] What do you mean?
I'm looking for Haruka.

144
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,416
I don't suppose you have
any way of knowing

145
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,916
how I could get her back...

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,083
[THE OTHERS]
Can you stop Noein?

147
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,625
I don't know that for sure...

148
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,750
But I will save her!

149
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,958
[THE OTHERS] If so, I will
deliver you to the accelerator.

150

[ASUKA] See?! It's gone,
Miyuki! It's really gone!

And Haruka's gone too!
She was in it!

Asu, you have to calm down!

It's back!

Wait a minute!

00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,583
What the... Impossible!

162
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,000
We're back? Really?

163
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,250
[ASUKA] Kids, what happened?!
Where did all of you go?!

164
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,916
Where's Yu? Are Haruka and
my son with you guys?!

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,416
Uhh...

166
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,041
I'm not sure you're
gonna believe us

167
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,083
if we say where she is...

168
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,583
Is it true?! I heard your
house disappeared!

169
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,375
Uh... What's going on?

170
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,041
[OPERATOR 1]
Quantum acceleration 65%.

171
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,166
Critical mass will be
achieved in 13 minutes.

172
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,666
[SHINOHARA cackles]

173
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,041
Spin! Yeah, spin for me, baby!

174
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,916
[NOEIN] You know this
dimension was formed

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,708
by the accumulation
of all sorrows.

176
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,458
That is why people had
obliterated their existences.

177
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,500
The existence of
mankind leads to sorrow.

178
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:55,750
Recognition can also be the
beginning of misunderstanding.

179
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,333
That is why people stopped
recognizing each other,

180
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,750
obliterated their
individual existences,

181
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,750
and become a
collective consciousness.

182
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,291
Yu!

183
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,666
Haruka!

184
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,958
Let her go, right now!

185
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,791
[NOEIN]
Oh, so you invited him as well.

186
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,916
Alright then, I will show you.

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,291
Come now, Haruka.

188
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,125
Dragon Torque...

189
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,375
There is no need
to choose a future.

190
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:41,083
All possible dimensions will
now become one with Shangri-la.

191
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,833
[YU]
Run, Haruka!

192
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,250
[UCHIDA]
Shut this down, now!

193
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,583
The surrounding quanta
will begin to resonate,

194
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,833
that means destruction!

195
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,583
[SHINOHARA]
I have no interest whatsoever

196
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,000
in the opinion of an amateur.

197
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,333
[UCHIDA]
You think this is a joke?!

198
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,666
[KOORIYAMA]
Nobody move!

199
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,833
[KOORIYAMA]
Now stop this thing!

200
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
[UCHIDA] Dr. Mayuzumi,
shut down this system!

201
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,125
Cute little gun...

202
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,208
[KOORIYAMA]
Shut up!

203
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,458
If you're gonna carry,
then carry this!

204
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,208
But you probably couldn't afford
it on your crappy salary.

205
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
How about I arrest you
for threatening an officer?

206
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,083
Shut the hell up!

207
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,083
Listen, do ya hear that?

208
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,750
That's the sound of
a new era starting.

209
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,333
8 minutes and 30 seconds
until critical mass.

210
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,458
What the hell is that thing...?

211
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,833
[KOSAGI] Did you see that?
What's happening?

212
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,625
[TOBI]
It's the Uroboros!

213
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,166
[ENRA]
It's fading!

214
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,458
I'm fading away...

215
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,583
Ahh, Enra!

216
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,958
The final barrier
limes are collapsing!

217
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,875
No! It can't be!

218
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,000
Oops! I think I shot him!
Oh well, self defense.

219
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,000
Kooriyama, no!

220
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,125
Ahh! Leave him be!

221
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,166
Bastard...

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,375
I warned you, didn't I?!

223
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,541
Shinohara! I started this
experiment to benefit mankind,

224
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,791
not to destroy it!

225
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,458
[SHINOHARA]
So what?!

226
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,541
[UCHIDA]
Dr. Mayuzumi!

227
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,083
[SHINOHARA] Did you think I
was oblivious to your plan?!

228
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,708
Did you really think
I wouldn't notice

229
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,208
you took down our security
to sneak these guys inside?!

230
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,708
So shut up and watch!

231
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,833
[YU]
Look out!

232
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,875
Don't interfere,
you little fool.

233
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,083
[NOEIN] You're actually
still going to fight me?

234
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,000
[YU]
I won't let you beat me!

235
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,791
[NOEIN]
I have no need of you.

236
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,666
Only one of us is necessary.

237
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,708
No!

238
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,083
[HARUKA]
Yu!

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,583
I so love to hate you.

240
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,000
Stop it, now!

241
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,750
[YU]
Karasu?!

242
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,625
That's right.
We are the same person.

243
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,291
Oh, if only I could
do it all over again...

244
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,500
I would go back to when
I was a boy like you...

245
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,666
[YU]
Don't mock me!

246
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,375
Your eyes are still
innocent and untainted.

247
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,416
It breaks my heart,
knowing those eyes

248
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
will become so deeply etched...

249
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,666
...with painful sorrow.

250
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,958
What're you talkin' about?!

251
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,541
[NOEIN]
Eventually, you are going to

252
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,375
experience great sadness.

253
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,958
A sadness so profound, you will
believe your life is cursed.

254
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,458
[HARUKA]
You're lying!

255
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,500
[YU]
Haruka!

256
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,916
I refuse to
believe those things!

257
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,875
Alright. I suppose I'll
just have to show you.

258
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,208
[YUKIE]
You've all grown up so much.

259
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,041
[ISAMI]
Of course we have. We're 17 now.

260
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,083
Has it really been 5 years
since you graduated?

261
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,958
Ms. Yukie, in 5 years you
haven't changed one bit.

262
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,791
Ha! Thanks a lot!

263
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,166
I see you've also learned
the art of kissing up.

264
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,458
[ISAMI]
Dude!

265
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,333
We're packed in
kinda tight back here.

266
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,500
Well, I guess you shoulda put

267
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,833
a little more
thought into it then.

268
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,000
Who me?

269
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,791
Yeah, you. He hasn't
been back from Tokyo

270
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,541
in a really long time.

271
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,250
You coulda let him
sit next to Haruka,

272
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,500
then you'd have the front seat.

273
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,375
Hey, knock it off, guys.

274
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,708
Great, now I feel
like a real jerk.

275
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
Hey, Ms. Yukie, step on it.

276
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,291
We'll be there in no time,
the way you drive.

277
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,625
Hey, you know what?
We're going fast enough.

278
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,250
[AI] It's too bad
Miho couldn't make it.

279
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,833
[ISAMI]
She had a wedding to attend.

280
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,166
[YU] By the way, what are
getting at the store--?

281
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,166
[HARUKA]
Yu...

282
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,708
Please...

283
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,000
Yu...

284
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,250
Help me...

285
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,541
Haruka--!

286
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,666
[NOEIN] In an instant,
I lost all of my friends...

287
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
...and the woman I loved.

288
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,083
Can you understand the sorrow?

289
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,375
The sorrow of the one
who is left behind?

290
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,625
[NOEIN] I experienced a
moment where the world

291
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,458
ceases to have any meaning.

292
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,375
Haruka...

293
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,083
Why did you desert me...

294
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,208
...and leave me all alone?!

295
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,500
You left!

296
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:56,583
[NOEIN sobbing]

297
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,250
[NOEIN]
Why did you do it?

298
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,541
[NOEIN] Why must I
take all the suffering?

299
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,041
I kept wandering
and kept searching...

300
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,708
...through every
dimension for you.

301
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,875
Hoping to find my Haruka...

302
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,583
But then...

303
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,041
...I finally understood.

304
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,583
I have come to realize
that in every dimension,

305
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,916
there is nothing
but pain and sorrow.

306
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,250
[NOEIN]
Everywhere there was death.

307
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,500
Everywhere there was pain...

308
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,416
...steeped in sorrow.

309
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,291
[HARUKA]
Yu, help me!

310
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,333
[YU]
Haruka!

311
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,166
[HARUKA]
Yu, help me!

312
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,125
[YU]
Haruka!

313
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,916
[HARUKA]
Yu, help meee!

314
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,541
[YU]
Harukaaa!

315
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:49,750
[NOEIN] Mankind does not simply
just exist in this dimension...

316
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:53,250
When people recognize
the dimension they see,

317
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,333
that dimension gains existence.

318
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,708
So, in reality,
the ultimate observer

319
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,791
is each and every
living human being.

320
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,625
That is why I lost hope.

321
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,750
All the dimensions cannot escape
the chain of unhappiness.

322
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,208
It started out all wrong.

323
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,208
[NOEIN] That is why I will
integrate every reality

324
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,250
into Shangri-la...

325
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,625
...and return it
all to nothingness.

326
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,541
[NOEIN] If we return all
to nothingness, the dimension

327
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,958
will be reborn
from the beginning,

328
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:31,041
and branch off, giving birth
to a new universe.

329
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,791
I know that a better dimension
will be born this time.

330
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,416
[NOEIN]
Come. Come to me.

331
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,541
[NOEIN] To release these people
from every kind of suffering.

332
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:50,833
From nothingness, let's bring
a new dimension into existence.

333
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,541
I hold the future in my hands!

334
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,833
[SHINOHARA cackles]

335
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,791
[OPERATOR 2]
10 seconds to critical mass!

336
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,291
It's happening!

337
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,750
Come to me, Haruka.

338
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,875
Come now.

339
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,833
Haruka!

340
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,625
[NOEIN] Because you
no longer have a future.

341
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,291
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

342
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,208
That summer day's dream.

343
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:07,750
[NOEIN] Dragon Torque, come with
me to a world of nothingness.

344
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,458
[YU]
Haruka!

345
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,833
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "The Beginning."

346
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,875
Please grant everyone's wishes.
