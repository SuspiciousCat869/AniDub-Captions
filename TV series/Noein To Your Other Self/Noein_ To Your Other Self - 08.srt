It's that guy!

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wha--?!

00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,208
Hey, Haruka!

[HARUKA]
Huh?

00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,208
Yu!

00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,958
[HARUKA]
Are you okay?

9
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,458
Are you feeling any pain?

10
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,416
No, I'll be fine.

11
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,208
[YU]
Get away from her!

12
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,458
Yu!

13
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,333
Run! We have to get away!

14
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,958
[HARUKA] No, we don't.
It's okay. He saved my life.

15
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,208
Uh?

16
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,333
[HARUKA] Are you okay,
Karasu? Are you hurt?

17
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
[KARASU]
Don't worry. It's temporary.

18
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,250
I'll be just fine soon enough.

19
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,041
[HARUKA] No way! We can't
leave you like this.

20
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,666
Hey, Yu. Help me out here.

21
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,083
[YU]
You're out of your mind.

22

[HARUKA]
Yu?

23
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,541
Yu!

Ugh, what's his problem anyway?

25
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,416
So, are you sure you're-- Oh!

26
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,958
[HARUKA] Oops... I can't go
around looking like this...

27
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,333
How am I gonna get home?

28
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,833
[FUKURO] I can't believe him...
Damn you, Karasu.

29
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,250
That fool has even
severed his pipeline

30
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,958
to protect the Dragon Torque.

31
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,708
His betrayal will
not be tolerated.

32
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,375
We will kill him ourselves.

33

That damned fool...

34
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,333
He knows damn well that
she's not the same Haruka...

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,458
Did you find her?

36
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,250
I asked around.
Nobody's seen her.

37
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,666
I knew it! Haruka's been taken

38
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,416
to a completely
different Universe!

equipped with science

40
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,375

--Shove a sock in it, Miho.
--[MIHO] Hmph!

What should we do, Ms. Yukie?

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,416
Well, we should
probably start by

44
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,250
rechecking all of the places
she might've gone to.

45
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,541
Sounds good!

46
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,833
Hey, I think you should
get into the backseat.

47
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,166
Yeah? Why should I?

48
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
[ISAMI]
Huh?

49
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Because he really wants
to sit next to Ms. Yukie.

50
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,166
What?! No, I don't! Shut up!

00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,541
[YU]
Haruka is back.

[ISAMI] What?! Are you
serious?! Where is she?

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:15,166
[YU] Don't worry. She's with
someone she trusts...

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,666
[ISAMI]
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,333

I-I gotta go.

Hey, are you still there?

What's wrong?

[YUKIE]
Has he found Haruka yet?

61
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,916
[ISAMI]
That's what he said.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,250
That's great.

Haruka a new one for this!

Oh, hello, Ai.

Um, is Haruka home yet?

I'm not really sure.
Hang on a sec, I'll check.

for you, honey. Haruka?

I'll be back later.

I'm home! I'm right here!

Why don't you answer me
when I call you?

82

[HARUKA] Sorry. I've had
a lot on my mind...

83

There's a phone call
for you from Ai.

That's what I'd like to know!

We've looked everywhere
for you! Where have you been?!

Yeah! Were you implanted with
an alien mind control device?!

What would I be hiding?

101
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,083
You sneaked something
in the house, didn't you?

102
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,250
You're acting suspicious!

No, that's not true!

bring something home,

you always hide it in here.

What? No I don't!

Don't go in there!

That's strange...
There's nothing in here.

See, I told you there was
nothing in here, didn't I?

sworn I heard something...

[MIYUKI growls]

163
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:20,916
[ATORI] I'm exhausted...
I'm so damn tired...

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,208
[TOBI]
Well, complaining won't help,

165
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,083
so you might as well
get used to it.

166
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,625
[ATORI]
Oh, shut up. I'm so lethargic.

167
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,500
[TOBI] Let's try to
find something to eat.

168
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,625
[TOBI] Hey, Atori. This looks
like it's still edible.

169
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,916
I'm not gonna eat that crap.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,250
Hey, we really need to get
some kind of nutrition

171
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,833
in us right away!

172
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,708
[ATORI]
Agh, this is pathetic!

173
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,375
Without our pipelines attached,

174
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,166
we're reduced to bottom
feeders in this world.

175
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,083
[TOBI]
It's the best we can hope for.

176
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,958
At least we don't have
withdrawal symptoms.

177
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,208
[ATORI] They fed me a line of
crap about altering every cell

178
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,625
in my body on a quantum level
to make me stronger,

179
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,708
then poked and prodded
me for this?!

180
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,625
And now I'm gonna die
in this depressing dump.

181
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,041
Eventually, the effects
of Shangri-la

182
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,833
will spread to
this dimension, too.

183
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:21,625
And any way you look at it,
it's all going to hell.

184
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,875
[ATORI chuckles]

185
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,500
[ATORI sighs]

186
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,208
What's with those guys?
They're weak now.

187
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,333
Oh yeah...

188
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,666
[ATORI]
Tobi! Get me water! Find some!

189
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,041
[TOBI]
Alright.

190
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,000
[TOBI]
I've found some, Atori.

191
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,083
[HARUKA sighs]

192
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,041
[knocking]

193
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,500
[HARUKA] Are you awake,
Karasu? I'm coming in.

194
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,333
Morning. How are
you feeling today?

195
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
Are you doing a
little bit better?

196
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,083
Don't you worry.
I'm doing a lot better now.

197
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,291
[HARUKA] Are you hungry?
Is there anything special

198
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,500
you like to eat?
I'll bring it to you.

199
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,125
I do not require much
food to sustain my body.

200
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,125
But I do need water
if you have some.

201
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,416
Seriously? All you
want is water?

202
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,333
Yeah, that is all. Thanks.

203
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,875
Kay. I'll bring you
some water. Just sit tight.

204
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,791
[HARUKA] How did you
get the name "Karasu"?

205
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,666
[KARASU] In our world, after you
have completed your training

206
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,583
to become a soldier, you are
honored with a new name.

207
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,333
Karasu was the name
that was given to me.

208
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,250
[HARUKA]
I see.

209
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,041
Karasu? Is it true
that your world

210
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,500
is really one of our futures?

211
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,375
That's right. In fact,
it's a parallel universe.

212
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,416
[HARUKA]
Oh...

213
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,375
[KARASU]
Is it difficult to believe?

214
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,458
No, it's not that, I guess.

215
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,541
I mean, I think that woman
really was my friend, Ai.

216
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,083
And...

217
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,375
Are you concerned about...
your own future?

218
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,291
Not really... I don't think
about it at all that much.

219
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,083
But can I ask you something?

220
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,250
In the past... was your name Yu?

221
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,291
And why do you think that?

222
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
It's just a hunch.

223
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,458
[KARASU]
I see...

224
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,166
Haruka. I am merely an
illusion in this dimension.

225
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,916
It does not really
matter who I am.

226
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,166
[HARUKA]
I understand.

227
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,125
It makes sense.
You are who you are.

228
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,916
[BARON barks]

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,041
[HARUKA] What's the matter,
Baron? Is someone there?

230
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,958
[HARUKA]
Yu!

231
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,000
[HARUKA] Hey! You're up
pretty early this morning!

232
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,291
Here, you forgot this.

233
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,916
Right... It fell off. Thank you.

234
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,625
Did something... happen between
you and your mom again?

235
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,833
[YU]
What do you care?

236
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,916
Don't talk to me like that!

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
We've all been worried
sick about you!

238
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,833
Just forget about it! I slept
in the park last night, okay?!

239
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:21,916
I'm not going back
home anymore. See ya.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,833
Hey, Yu! Hold on
a second, will ya?

241
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,041
What d'you want?!

242
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
Just come with me, alright?

243
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,250
Hey, what're you doin'?!

244
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,083
[EMI]
Miyuki, what're you doing?

245
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,416
Oh, I guess you're
still eating, huh?

246
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,208
I have practice this morning,
so I'm going without you.

247
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,333
Don't be late for school now!

248
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,833
Oh, Emi...

249
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,166
Yu... Oh, I just
have to find him...

250
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,000
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

251
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,416
[YU]
What the hell do you want?

252
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,041
[HARUKA] Oh, come on.
Have you eaten anything?

253
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,333
[BARON whines]

254
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,875
Hey, Baron. Long time no see.

255
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,666
Hey, cut it out! Hey!

256
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,791
[YU laughs]

257
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,458
[YU]
Come on, boy!

258
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,833
Oh, Baron.
You're such a big moose.

259
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
[YU]
Ooh, I'll get you for that!

260
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,666
[YU laughs]

261
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,041
So, tell me what's wrong.
What happened, Yu?

262
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,416
Just forget about me.
Where were you?

263
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,625
Huh?

264
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,083
We spent the entire
night looking for you.

265
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm fine! You guys
shouldn't worry about me!

266
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,291
Well, we did!

267
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,458
[HARUKA] Anyway!
What happened with you?

268
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,166
Did you really spend the
whole night in the park?

269
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,208
I said that's none
of your business.

270
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,666
[HARUKA]
You did. But we promised

271
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,916
to run away together, remember?

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
Yeah, right.
You're the one who forgot.

273
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,916
I promise you I didn't
forget. I just--

274
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,041
I don't need your excuses, 'kay?

275
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,333
[HARUKA gasps]

276
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,791
Right, boy? You'll agree
with me, won't ya?

277
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,750
[BARON whines]

278
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,666
[ASUKA] I guess Haruka
must still be sleeping.

279
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,416
So, what're you gonna do now?

280
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,708
Your mom's gotta be pretty
worried about you...

281
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,791
Just keep your nose
outta my business.

282
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,041
Y'know, if you don't wanna
take the entrance exams,

283
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,375
you should just tell her.

284
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,958
Don't you think I would've
done that if it was that easy?

285
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,333
Huh?

286
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,125
She wasn't always like this.
You know what I mean?

287
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,958
She'd tell me to study
and get good grades,

288
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,416
but she's not the same now.

289
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,208
Didn't it all start
about two years ago, huh?

290
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,041
Around there, yeah. Probably
started around the same time

291
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,625
my grandma in Sapporo died.

292
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,958
[YU gasps]

293
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,375
That's right! Mom did
something weird on the train

294
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,250
coming home from the funeral...

295
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,791
[MIYUKI] Mother... Are you
happy to see her again?

296
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,916
You loved Emi. She really
was such a great sister.

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
I'll miss her.

298
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,916
So, who's Emi?

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,458
She probably meant my aunt.

300
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,791
I never really got
a chance to meet her.

301
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,041
Why not?

302
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,958
She passed away. I was
told that she was killed

303
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,583
in a really bad car accident

304
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,041
when she was still
in high school.

305
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,541
Oh no... That's so sad...

306
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,166
I wonder why your mom would
say something like that?

307
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,458
Ah, beats me.
I'm kinda hungry...

308
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,916
Oh, you want me to
get you something?

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,958
[YU] D'you still keep munchies
in your desk drawer?

310
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,375
I'll just have that.

311
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,208
Hey! Get outta there!

312
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,791
Don't go through people's
desks without asking!

313
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,666
[YU] You haven't got anything
important in here.

314
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,125
[HARUKA]
Hey, cut it out!

315
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,500
[YU]
See? Found some.

316
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,583
[HARUKA]
That's my chocolate!

317
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,958
If you're hungry, I'll just
go get you something to eat!

318
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,958
[YU] Y'know, you've always
been a skinny, little kid.

319
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,458
But if you keep eating
junk food like this...

320
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,083
...you're gonna get real fat.

321
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,958
You haven't changed at all
either, have you?! Give it back!

322
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,375
[thudding]

323
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,333
What in the world could
she be doing up there

324
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,708
with Baron so early
in the morning?

325
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,333
[HARUKA]
I said give it back!

326
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,083
[YU]
I don't think so!

327
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,166
[HARUKA]
Yu, cut it out! Quit it!

328
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,500
[YU]
Junkie! Junkie!

329
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,291
Don't call me that!

330
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,791
[BARON barks]

331
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,625
[HARUKA]
Huh?

332
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,458
What is it, Baron?

333
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,500
Huh?

334
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,083
[YU]
Hey, what's up?

335
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,458
[YU]
Mom...

336
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,375
She's come here looking for you.

337
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,291
Tell her I'm not here!

338
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,083
Don't let her find me!

339
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,083
But what if she finds out
that you are here?

340
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,375
I know! Here!

341
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,958
[YU]
Hey, where are we going?

342
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,583
You can hide in this room.
Karasu is in here, too.

343
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,041
Huh? What're you doing?

344
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,791
Why are you here?

345
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,250
[knocking]

346
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,208
[HARUKA]
Coming! I'll be right there!

347
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,458
What do I do now? This is
really not too good...

348
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:38,000
[knocking]

349
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,291
[HARUKA]
Coming! Just give me a second!

350
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,416
Sorry to drop by so early today.

351
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,708
Yu, are you here?

352
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,041
He's not here.

353
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,000
[MIYUKI] I know he's in here!
Get out of my way!

354
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,375
No! Please, don't do this!

355
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,041
Thought so!

356
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,750
Come in.

357
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:10,625
[KARASU] What's the matter?
Are you afraid?

358
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,250
Do it!

359
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,541
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

360
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,166
That summer day's dream.

361
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,666
Yu! Come out here, now!

362
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,708
[KARASU]
You're such a spineless coward!

363
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,500
[YU] You don't know anything
about me, do you?!

364
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,916
[HARUKA]
Next episode, "Beyond Time."

365
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,708
Do you remember the old days?
