1
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:32,442
[ISAMI]
Who's that?

2
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,275
[YU]
Where is she?

3
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,983
Tell me where
Haruka is right now!

4
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,192
Answer me! Tell me
what happened to her!

5
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,733
Where'd she go?

6
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:49,150
Hey, take it easy, man!

7
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:53,608
[YU]
She got left behind, didn't she?

8
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:46,192
[KOORIYAMA]
They... disappeared.

9
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,692
Okay. What the hell's
goin' on here?

10
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,525
The erosion of Shangri-la
is getting worse by the minute.

11
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,150
If this continues,
a violation of causation

12
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,525
could occur in this
dimension as well.

13
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,900
[UCHIDA]
Huh?

14
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:00,942
Actually, it may have
started already.

15
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,317
A violation of causation...

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,025
Say it in English, please!

17
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,067
So us simple humans
can understand it, too.

18
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,942
[UCHIDA] It means cause and
effect become reversed.

19
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,900
Right. And that's
a big deal because...?

20
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:18,442
The past will become
influenced by the future.

21
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,567
[KOORIYAMA] The past can be
influenced by the future?

22
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,358
Is that even possible?

23
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,942
Karasu!

24
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,775
[NOEIN]
You should forget about him.

25
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:53,275
Because to you,
he is merely an illusion.

26
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,692
He's not! I don't believe it.

27
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:59,567
[NOEIN] Then go find out
for yourself, Haruka.

28
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,775
[HARUKA]
You are always there for me.

29
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,525
[HARUKA]
I'm going out for a second!

30
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:26,942
[HARUKA gasps]

31
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,817
[KARASU] What do you intend
to do with the Dragon Torque?

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,733
[HARUKA screams]

33
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:43,233
[KARASU yells]

34
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:46,900
Help me!

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,317
[HARUKA]
Am I... Am I gonna die?

36
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:03,317
[HARUKA] Karasu is Yu...
15 years in the future. Right?

37
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,233
You found her.

38
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,900
[HARUKA]
Karasu!

39
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,233
[KARASU]
Ha...ruka.

40
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,192
Karasu!

41
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,108
Haruka...

42
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:09,858
What is this?

43
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:12,983
[HARUKA]
Huh? It's already 7:30!

44
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:16,608
Oh no, I overslept!

45
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,525
[HARUKA]
But that's another me.

46
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,525
[HARUKA]
Mom! Breakfast is ready, okay?

47
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,358
[ASUKA]
What time is it?

48
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,233
It's a few minutes after eight.

49
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,608
I have to leave
for school now. Bye.

50
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,525
[ASUKA]
Have fun!

51
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,192
Think I'll sleep
in a little bit.

52
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:55,775
[HARUKA] Today's the
last day of the semester.

53
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,150
That is a homeless spirit.

54
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,525
[MIHO]
If you talk to it,

55
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,775
you'll get dragged
into the spirit world!

56
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,733
[HARUKA]
Morning, Ai!

57
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,025
[AI]
Hi, Haruka!

58
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,942
What's all the
conversation about?

59
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,525
Miho is yapping about
spiritual phenomena.

60
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,150
So what else is new?

61
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,233
Good morning, everyone!

62
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,942
Bell's about to ring,
take your seats.

63
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,108
[YUKIE] I'll take summer break
consultations after homeroom.

64
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,942
I got a question, Miss Yukie!

65
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,317
[YUKIE]
Yes, Isami?

66
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,483
[ISAMI] Can we go on a
date during summer break?

67
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,317
[YUKIE] I'm so sorry...
I'm all booked up...

68
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,900
...for the next three years.

69
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,942
[ISAMI]
That's impossible...

70
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,942
[HARUKA] I think this
is slightly different.

71
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,192
[AI] Okay, it's settled.
You're coming with us

72
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,192
for fright night, Isami.

73
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm pretty sure I'm busy.

74
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,192
We can't go to fright night.
We got plans.

75
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,567
Back me up, will ya?

76
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,983
Yeah right. I can't go.
I'm going to summer school.

77
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,275
What about me?

78
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,650
Yeah, nice try. Make sure
you show up, Isami.

79
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,483
Could it be that you're really
just a little scaredy cat?

80
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,067
And that you're so
incredibly frightened

81
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,442
that you'll just totally
pee in your pants?

82
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,025
What are you
talkin' about, Miho?

83
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,650
[MIHO]
Am I right or not?

84
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,108
[ISAMI]
Not!

85
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,900
[HARUKA]
Hey! Wait up a minute, Yu!

86
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,942
You've been acting kinda
weird lately. What's up?

87
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:28,650
I guess you forgot
about it then, huh?

88
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,233
[ISAMI]
Some friend. He's really been

89
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,108
kind of a buzz kill
lately, hasn't he?

90
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,650
He can't help it.
He's gotta study

91
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,942
for those middle school tests.

92
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,567
[HARUKA]
I remember this. But I think

93
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,733
there's something
different about it.

94
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,233
[SHINOHARA]
Nice ship, huh?

95
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:04,400
It cost a cool
125 million bucks.

96
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:05,733
It's not a passenger ship,

97
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,983
so it isn't that
comfortable a ride, but...

98
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,900
Shinohara.

99
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,567
[SHINOHARA]
Just take your time there.

100
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,483
It's easy to tell you're
really dyin' to see it.

101
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,817
I thought the deal was
you'd call off the experiment.

102
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,483
What? Was that the deal?

103
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,275
I somehow doubt that what I said

104
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,817
was that I'd
actually call it off.

105
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,150
Why you...

106
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:32,275
Besides that, you accepted
the money, didn't ya?

107
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,608
That was for the work
I'd already done!

108
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:37,608
Look, I paid you a lot of money
for your services, Doctor.

109
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,400
I think I'm entitled to
a little free consultation.

110
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,775
You see the kinda crap
I gotta put up with?

111
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,317
Just the other day they
had three failed tests

112
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,192
at the Tsukuba laboratory.

113
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:51,025
Naturally I fired 5 of
those idiots on the spot.

114
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,067
[MAYUZUMI]
I can't do this anymore.

115
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,567
If you'll excuse me...

116
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,442
[SHINOHARA] It's your call,
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

117
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,942
You can't do that, Shinohara.

118
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,692
The theta particles will leak
if you don't fix it first!

119
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,233
Is that right?

120
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,442
Oh well. I'll be
watching the experiment

121
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,358
from Tokyo anyway,
so what do I care?

122
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,650
[MAYUZUMI]
Wha...?

123
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,983
Do you want to disintegrate
the entire region?

124
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,817
[SHINOHARA] You know,
now that I think about it...

125
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,775
isn't it true your daughter
lives around here somewhere?

126
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:24,067
Come on, Doctor,
let's watch it together.

127
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,567
Let's see this world that
transcends time and space.

128
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,108
[BARON whines]

129
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:41,525
[HARUKA]
Uh-oh. I dozed off.

130
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,775
What time is it?

131
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:49,150
[HARUKA] That's right!
I went to Yu's summer school.

132
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,233
[YU] Why are you hanging
out in front of my school?

133
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:59,233
[HARUKA] I don't know.
I guess I was just bored.

134
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,692
[YU]
You shouldn't be here this late.

135
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,900
They could arrest you
for breaking curfew.

136
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,400
[HARUKA]
If you're so worried about that,

137
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,525
then you shouldn't
run away from home.

138
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:10,233
Yeah, well you're the one who
suggested it, remember?

139
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,442
Because you wanted to go to
your dad's place in Tokyo!

140
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,275
I was fighting with
my mom when I said that.

141
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,650
It's hard, okay.
You don't realize...

142
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,983
My parents are divorced,
it's confusing.

143
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,483
I don't know why I ever
took you seriously.

144
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,983
That's not nice!

145
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,025
[YU]
Just forget it.

146
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:29,858
[HARUKA]
Come on! Don't be mad! Okay?

147
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,025
[YU]
Even if I did run away,

148
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,858
they'd just find me
and bring me back.

149
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:39,567
I'll never get to do
anything on my own.

150
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,983
I should just give up now.

151
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,358
Please don't say that.
When you grow up,

152
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,567
you'll be able to go
anywhere you want to.

153
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,942
[YU] I just wish I
was a grown-up now!

154
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:53,817
[HARUKA]
I know.

155
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,692
[YU]
I hate being a child.

156
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,983
I just... wanna grow up
as fast as I can!

157
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,317
[YU sobbing]

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,192
[HARUKA]
No...

159
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:07,192
I think... I think
I'm losing it!

160
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,108
[YU]
Don't follow me anymore!

161
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,483
[HARUKA] Hey! You didn't have
to push me over, you know.

162
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,192
[YU]
I'm... sorry.

163
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,900
[HARUKA]
This is different, too.

164
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,942
[HARUKA]
Where's Karasu?

165
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,275
[HARUKA]
Hey, let's run away tomorrow.

166
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,192
[HARUKA]
This me that's here is...

167
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,108
Are you serious?

168
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,775
We said we'd do it...

169
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,733
We can leave tomorrow
morning, right?

170
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,233
Where are we gonna go?

171
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:49,775
Tokyo. We can go stay
there with my dad.

172
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:50,900
[HARUKA gasps]

173
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,400
What's wrong?

174
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,942
I don't know.

175
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,858
[HARUKA] I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

176
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,858
[HARUKA]
Something important.

177
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:05,025
Who is that?

178
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,858
[HARUKA]
I don't remember...

179
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:10,483
[NOEIN]
You will forget.

180
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,817
Did you ever get
ahold of your dad?

181
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,775
Did he say anything about
you running away?

182
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,983
I guess I ran away from home.

183
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:27,775
[TIME DRIFTER]
Is that the dimension you want?

184
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:28,733
Huh?

185
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,650
The decision's yours to make.

186
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,650
Is that the dimension that
you have chosen to live in?

187
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:37,067
Is it your desire to
settle for this reality?

188
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,192
What are you talking about?

189
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,900
My choice...?

190
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,858
[HARUKA]
Karasu came from the future.

191
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,900
But I'm sure I know who he is!

192
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,442
[HARUKA]
He always protects me.

193
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,400
[ATORI]
Haha! Die!

194
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,025
Fukuro!

195
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:37,483
[HARUKA] But someday...
Karasu will leave me.

196
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,608
[HARUKA] After all,
there can only be one Yu.

197
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:50,483
[KARASU] Was I saved
by Haruka once again?

198
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,317
Huh?

199
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,025
It's like it was the last time.

200
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,025
[KARASU] I was supposed
to die in that battle.

201
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:15,233
[FUKURO]
Don't let it reach the ground!

202
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,067
[KOSAGI]
Where is Karasu?

203
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,775
[FUKURO]
Go around to the left!

204
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:24,983
[KOSAGI]
Not again! It has a shield!

205
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,108
[FUKURO]
Karasu has jumped on!

206
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:06,817
[KARASU grunting]

207
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,108
[KARASU screams]

208
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,775
[FUKURO] It's no good!
It's collapsing! Get out now!

209
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,692
Karasu!

210
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:50,983
[KARASU] When I passed through
the dimensional ravine...

211
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,358
...I arrived here.

212
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,192
But what I didn't
realize was that

213
00:16:57,275 --> 00:17:02,067
I had been transported
to another nearby dimension.

214
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:08,108
My life was saved by being
drawn into this world.

215
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:13,942
But because I...
transported here...

216
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:17,233
...La'cryma found out
about this reality,

217
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:21,233
and learned about
the existence of Haruka.

218
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:26,358
So... It's possible I drew
another dimension here.

219
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,192
They want...

220
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,692
[YU gasps]

221
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,067
[KARASU gasps]

222
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,483
[YU]
Haruka!

223
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,275
[HARUKA gasps]

224
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:37,317
Where am I?

225
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,817
[MIHO]
They're here! They're here!

226
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,192
I can feel their presence.

227
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,108
[ISAMI] Cut it out, Miho.
You're freakin' me out.

228
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,358
[MIHO]
What are you talking about?

229
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,067
We are trying to meet ghosts.

230
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,317
Could you please be
a little more serious.

231
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,108
And how do I do that?

232
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:52,525
[MIHO] Sense them. Chant from
the bottom of your heart.

233
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:55,817
Now! Mr. Ghost, Mr. Ghost!
Please come out!

234
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,483
She's impossible.

235
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,983
[AI]
It shouldn't bother you.

236
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,150
Huh?

237
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,817
There's nothing we
can do. His mom wouldn't

238
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,775
let him come out with us anyway.

239
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:06,775
I guess so.

240
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,525
Hey, cheer up, Haruka!

241
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:09,775
[HARUKA]
Mhmm.

242
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:12,817
[AI] Come on, let's go.
We'll get left behind.

243
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,067
Hey, Ai, I have this feeling
I'm forgetting something

244
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,900
that's really important.

245
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:20,692
[NOEIN]
Haruka.

246
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,567
[ISAMI]
Can we go home now?

247
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,442
[MIHO] No! I am not going
home until I see a ghost!

248
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,275
[ISAMI]
Come on already!

249
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,983
Something's
definitely different.

250
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,483
It shouldn't be this way.

251
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,775
You're right!
There's no such thing

252
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,983
as a graveyard without ghosts!

253
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,733
[HARUKA gasps]

254
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,317
It's coming this way!

255
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,692
What's that?

256
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:50,025
--We have to run!
--What are we running from?

257
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,692
Hurry come on, we have
to get outta here now!

258
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,858
[MIHO]
Something is flying right at us!

259
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,150
[ISAMI]
That's impossible!

260
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,858
[HARUKA]
Everybody run for it!

261
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:05,275
[NOEIN]
There she is!

262
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,525
Just impossible.

263
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,608
A ghost! A land bound spirit!

264
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,525
What's going on here?

265
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,650
[HARUKA]
He's after me! Alright...

266
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,400
[HARUKA]
Go that way!

267
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:32,525
[NOEIN]
I finally found you, Haruka.

268
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:33,858
Stay back!

269
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,150
Huh?

270
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:41,233
[NOEIN] So... you've assimilated
with yourself of this dimension.

271
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:47,192
[NOEIN] It's alright now.
Come along, let's go home.

272
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,692
But... But who are you?

273
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,983
[NOEIN]
Oh, Haruka, have you forgotten?

274
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:59,525
[NOEIN] If you return
with me, you will remember.

275
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:06,692
[NOEIN] Now come. Come back
with me to Shangri-la.

276
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,567
[YU]
Haruka!!

277
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,608
Yu!

278
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,233
Who are you?

279
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,192
Tell me now.

280
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,442
[NOEIN]
Who, me?

281
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:29,233
[NOEIN cackles]

282
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,692
[NOEIN]
Do you want to know?

283
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,358
[YU]
I said tell me.

284
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:36,358
[NOEIN] Are you sure
you really want to know?

285
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,025
Who are you?

286
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,233
[NOEIN]
If you wish.

287
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,900
Just tell me.

288
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,608
[NOEIN]
I... am you.

289
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,067
[HARUKA gasps]

290
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,858
Run, Haruka! Go on!

291
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:06,233
[HARUKA] This isn't
where I was... and I...

292
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:09,900
I think I was forgetting
something important.

293
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:16,692
[HARUKA] I remember!
This is where I met Karasu!

294
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:32,317
[HARUKA] But it wasn't the first
time. I met him once before.

295
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:37,275
[HARUKA] It was almost spring,
but it was snowing that day...

296
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,275
...at that church.

297
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:24,067
[NOEIN] What is happening? The
dimension is becoming warped.

298
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,775
[YU]
Haruka!

299
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:37,108
[HARUKA]
Huh?

300
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,900
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

301
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:49,442
Oh, Yu. Once again,
you tried to rescue me.

302
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:55,942
[HARUKA]
Thanks.

303
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,567
[YU]
It-It's no big deal.

304
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,692
[YU]
He was worried about you, too.

305
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,192
[HARUKA]
Who?

306
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,192
Karasu!

307
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,067
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

308
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,608
That summer day's dream.

309
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:08,608
[KOSAGI] It doesn't matter,
even if I disappear.

310
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,817
[HARUKA]
Whoever you are, don't do this!

311
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,608
[KOSAGI]
Then fight me, Karasu!

312
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:24,275
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "Dilemma."

313
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,692
Can you look within yourself?
