1
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,083
My mom looks so wonderful!

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:26,041
This is amazing! I can't
wait to get married myself!

3
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,000
[HARUKA]
This really is wonderful.

4
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,041
Your mom makes
a pretty bride, Ai.

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,333
I'm sorry, who are you again?

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,875
[MIHO]
What's wrong?

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,583
[AI]
Miho, do you know this girl?

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,666
Hey, who you guys
talkin' to over here?

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,708
Isami, do you know who she is?

10
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,041
Um... Hi there, can you
tell me your name again?

11
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,000
I've never seen her before...

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,750
Huh? What's going on?

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,333
[ISAMI]
Hey, Yu!

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,500
[YU]
Huh?

15
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,458
Any idea who this could be?

16
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,708
Hello? It's me!

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,166
And who are you again?

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,625
No...

19
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,250
Hey, what is it, Haruka?

20
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,375
[HARUKA]
Huh?

21
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,500
Ugh, there she goes,
spacing out again.

22
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,375
[HARUKA]
No... I...

23
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:18,000
I think I was having a really
bizarre daydream or something.

24
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,208
You can dream while
you're walking?

25
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,500
Yeah, that's our Haruka.

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,041
That dream you just had...

27
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,291
Was it a hallucination that
everyone had forgotten you?

28
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,083
But how can you be
completely certain

29
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,500
that you're actually
here right now?

30
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,458
Or... is this dimension
only an illusion?

31
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,958
[NOEIN]
Perhaps you are just lost

32
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,458
in a dream of a
phantom dimension?

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,500
[NOEIN]
Think about it... Haruka.

34
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,750
[HARUKA gasps]

35
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,083
[HARUKA]
Ai's parent's wedding...

36
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,958
It really happened
yesterday, didn't it...?

37
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,833
I was there too, wasn't I...?

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,625
Hang on, this whole thing
can't be just a dream, can it?

39
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,333
Oh, wait, I know.

40
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,208
[HARUKA]
Hmm...

41
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,541
[HARUKA]
Hm.

42
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
[HARUKA]
Got it!

43
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,333
I do exist!

44
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,958
I knew it.

45
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,333
I mean, these are of me.

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:27,291
[HARUKA] These are all pictures
of me when I was really little.

47
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,833
[HARUKA]
Huh...?

48
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,625
[HARUKA]
There's gotta be more.

49
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,625
I don't remember
this video tape, do I?

50
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,916
A magnetic tape?
Haven't seen these in a while.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,291
[HARUKA] I tried to watch it
on my video player,

52
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,541
but it didn't work.

53
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,875
Can you help?

54
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,583
It's probably configured
differently from the tape.

55
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,500
[HARUKA]
Then how can I watch it?

56
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,166
Let me think... Huh...

57
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,791
Is there something
important recorded on it?

58
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,250
I think it just has footage
of me when I was little.

59
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,083
I would like to see that, too!

60
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,208
Can I watch it with you, Haruka?

61
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,375
Of course you can, Atori!

62
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,083
So, Tobi, what should I do?

63
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,791
Well, I think the
quickest way would be

64
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,875
to find a deck that can play
this kind of video tape.

65
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,416
[YU]
This is an 8mm video.

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,625
Unfotunately, I don't have
a deck that can play

67
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,125
this kind of tape either.

68
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,000
[HARUKA] Well, do you know
anyone that might have one?

69
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,041
I don't think I do.
It's a pretty outdated format.

70
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,833
So, why do you wanna see
this all of a sudden?

71
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,875
Umm... I don't know... It's
really kind of hard to explain.

72
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,791
But I wanna watch it, okay?!
I just have to see it, please?!

73
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,458
Take it easy!

74
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,541
Why don't we just ask Isami?

75
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,708
Maybe his brother knows where
we might be able to find one.

76
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,708
[KUINA] Damn you! Damn you!
Damn you! Damn you!

77
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,083
Damn you!

78
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:43,583
[NOEIN]
Betrayed again? How very sad.

79
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,875
[KUINA]
Huh?

80
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,458
[NOEIN] Your destiny
is inevitably unfortunate.

81
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,416
I pity you, Kuina.

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,375
Noein! Please! Please,
take me away to Shangri-la!

83
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,291
And do it right away!

84
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,708
[NOEIN]
That I cannot do.

85
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,958
You have yet to fulfill
your part of the negotiation.

86
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,250
It won't be that easy!

87
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,458
The Dragon Torque's
power is increasing!

88
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,291
[NOEIN]
This power has accelerated

89
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,875
thanks to its contact
with La'cryma.

90
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,041
[NOEIN]
More than I had predicted.

91
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,666
[NOEIN] With that much power,
the Dragon Torque

92
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,458
can now come to
Shangri-la on its own will.

93
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,291
I have lost faith in you, Kuina.

94
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:35,750
And I have come all the way to
La'cryma to grant your request.

95
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,625
No, wait a minute...!

96
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,041
[NOEIN]
You have completed your duty.

97
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,083
This is goodbye, Kuina.

98
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,958
Don't do this, Noein! Please!

99
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,291
Take me there, please!

100
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,666
Take me to Shangri-la!

101
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,708
Please! Please!
Don't leave me here...

102
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,583
[MIHO]
An 8mm video, huh?

103
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,125
It's highly doubtful that anyone
still uses those things today.

104
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,666
That's funny.

105
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,125
I kinda thought there might
be one lying around your house,

106
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,000
since you're so rich
with tons of stuff.

107
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,583
No, no, silly girl.

108
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,250
The rich will constantly
discard anything that is old

109
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,416
in favor of buying
something that is new.

110
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Everyone knows there is only
one thing the rich treasure:

111
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,666
That is cold, hard cash.

112
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,791
[MIHO] In an emergency,
cash always wins, hands down.

114
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,916
I think that's right.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,250
Haruka!

116
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,500
I have a feeling.

117
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,000
I think this just might
be a cursed video tape!

118
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,166
What?

119
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,541
Like, if you don't
watch it, you'll die!

120
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,041
That's it, isn't it?!
It's a cursed videotape!

121
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,500
If anyone else watches it...

122
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,875
Well, this was a waste of
an hour. Where's Yu looking?

123
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
He's at Isami's to see
if he's got one.

124
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,541
He's with Isami?

125
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,958
Ooh! I just knew it! You like
Isami! That's unbelievably cute!

126
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,375
Shut it, Miho!

127
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,625
It's not cute, and I don't
like him, so knock it off!

128
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,166
[MIHO] I think you protest
too much! Heh, heh.

129
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,458
--[AI] Miho!
--[MIHO] Waah!

130
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,958
[KUINA] I swear I will
get to Shangri-la...!

131
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,291
[KOORIYAMA] So you're just
gonna go up and ask her?

132
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,625
Yes, I think it's probably
the quickest way

133
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,166
to get in touch with
Dr. Mayuzumi. You agree?

134
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,083
[KOORIYAMA] I guess,
but don't you think he's gonna

135
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,125
be kinda suspicious if we
get his kid mixed up in this?

136
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,833
[UCHIDA]
She's already mixed up in this.

137
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,166
Haruka may be at the
center of it all.

138
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,250
[KOORIYAMA]
I still don't buy it.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,041
These alternative dimensions
or whatever you call it.

140
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:38,250
I keep thinking that we're just
having the same long nightmare.

141
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,166
[TOBI]
There you are.

142
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,041
So what are you doing here?

143
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,375
Watching the ocean.

144
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,958
How come?

145
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,625
Because there's not one where I
come from. As far as I remember.

146
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,583
Maybe that's okay.

147
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,375
You should stop
thinking about it

148
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,000
and let all the unpleasant
things stay forgotten.

149
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,583
Yes, I suppose. It's just...

150
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,041
I'm still worried about Sara...

151
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,583
[TOBI]
Atori...

152
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,916
Hi, good afternoon. Would you
know if Haruka is around?

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,875
Hi. Actually, I don't think
she's here right now.

154
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,791
Let's wait inside.

155
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,166
You sure?

156
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,833
Do you think I can't sense you?
Why are you following me?

157
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,583
Because I'm watching you.
To keep my promise.

158
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
I said I would watch you
vanish in this dimension,

159
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,458
and I meant it.

160
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,083
[KARASU]
Hmph.

161
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,333
Behave yourself until you
synchronize to this dimension.

162
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,375
Karasu!

163
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,625
[KOSAGI gasps]

164
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,041
[KUINA] So you ran off
to be with Karasu.

165
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,875
I never though you
would betray me.

166
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,625
Kuina!

167
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,750
[KUINA]
You care for him so much,

168
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,833
that you decided to disappear
at his side in this dimension.

169
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,416
Don't you understand?!

170
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,875
Every dimension in existance
only gives pain to the living!

171
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,333
Think of your own past!

172
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,916
Wasn't it filled with
darkness and despair?!

173
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,708
Shangri-la is trying
to realign time

174
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,666
and straighten out the warp!

175
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,250
You've sided with Shangri-la?!

176
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
If you were to go there,
you'd be free

177
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,958
from all your pain
and suffering!

178
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,583
You traitor!

179
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,541
[KUINA] Use this and survive
as long as possible.

180
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,083
[TOBI] We came to this dimension
to capture the Dragon Torque.

181
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,625
The Dragon Torque?
What the hell is that?

182
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,000
[TOBI] I think I should tell you
everything there is to know.

183
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,750
Dragon Torque is a codename
for the aggregate

184
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,125
of high-density Reizu particles.

185
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,875
Reizu particles?
I don't understand;

186
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,875
what were you trying
to do with them?

187
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,208
You see, our dimension's
on the verge of obliteration.

188
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,750
We came into contact with
one called "Shangri-la"

189
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,208
which caused out
dimension to break down.

190
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,291
The Reizu keeps it together.

191
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,708
Dimensions bein' obliterated...

192
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,958
And you discovered
a way to prevent it?

193
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,166
[TOBI]
Well... sort of... However--

194
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,541
Okay, I think it's a little late

195
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,958
to start keeping
secrets, don't you?

196
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,416
Yes, you're right. We built a
quantum computer in our reality,

197
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,416
and it estimated
the coordinates.

198
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,916
Then Atori and I, as quantized
humans, observed and confirmed

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,625
the existance of the Dragon
Torque in the other dimension.

200
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,916
The first one of us to find
the Dragon Torque was Karasu.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,583
Unfortunately, in the process,
he was flung into

202
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,875
the dimensional ravine
in mid-combat.

203
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,291
Hold on a sec, don't tell me

204
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,041
that your Dragon
Torque is really...?

205
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,625
[TOBI] This world is just
a coordinate calculated

206
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,666
by our quantum computer.

207
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,875
It was only supposed
to be imaginary numbers.

208
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,208
The skies, the Earth-- it's all
simply an illusion to us.

209
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,750
And the Dragon Torque was
supposed to be exactly the same.

210
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,833
However...

211
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,500
But the instant you
all transported

212
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,333
into the world of
imaginary numbers,

213
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,625
this dimension became
real to you.

214
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:29,000
As did our friend Haruka in
the form of a 12 year-old girl.

215
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,250
The problem is,
the reality you came from

216
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,791
is only one of many
possible futures,

217
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,125
and, if whatever happened
to cause that future

218
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,750
in your dimension is
startin' to happen here--

219
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,708
Just a moment, Miss Uchida!

220
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,000
Your future is based on

221
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,791
a computer generating
imaginary numbers.

222
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,708
There is just no way in which
the reality of my world

223
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,208
can be influenced
by this dimension.

224
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,416
That might be, but the
Magic Circle Project

225
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,916
is about to start.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
They are runnin' an experiment
which, if successful, will

227
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:05,416
artifically create the Reizu
particles to which you refer.

228
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,708
[TOBI]
That's bad.

229
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,083
With Shangri-la's erasure
of this dimension,

230
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,750
it is realizing the end
of all causation.

231
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,208
So you're sayin' that our world
is startin' to be influenced

232
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,208
by the future as well?

233
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,708
The ocean...

234
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,750
The ocean is glowing...

235
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,291
[KUINA]
You have impressive agility

236
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,625
despite being severed
from the pipeline.

237
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:36,125
It's a shame to destroy such
an exemplary Dragon Soldier.

238
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,000
In your current state,
I alone can defeat you.

239
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,958
[KUINA]
Now, die!

240
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,541
Not bad, Karasu!

241
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
[KARASU groans]

242
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,791
[KUINA]
Sh... Shangri-la!

243
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,541
[ISAMI]
My brother said he borrowed it

244
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,958
from a friend of his.

245
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,250
[AI] Aren't you glad you found
a video player, Haruka?

246
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,333
[HARUKA]
Uh-huh.

247
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,666
[MIHO]
Now we can find out the truth

248
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,416
behind the cursed videotape!

249
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,875
Will you knock it off?

250
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,666
Let's all go watch
it at my place!

251
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,750
Like she wants us to watch those
embarassing videos with her.

252
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,708
It's not that
they're embarassing...

253
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,458
I think if it's a
bunch of memories,

254
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,083
then maybe you should
watch it by yourself.

255
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,666
[NOEIN]
Haruka...

256
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,208
Who is that?

257
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,708
[NOEIN]
I'm coming for you...

258
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,666
Hey, what's the matter, Haruka?

259
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,125
I don't think I
like this wind...

260
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,583
[HARUKA]
Something's coming...

261
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,458
Haruka!

262
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,458
[HARUKA]
There it is.

263
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,500
[HARUKA]
Shangri-la...

264
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,666
Not Destructrons...!

265
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,833
Kuina!

266
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
Hey, what could
that thing be, guys?

267
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,166
Doesn't look like
a plane, does it?

268
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,083
I don't think so! Pretty sure
it's something else!

269
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,958
[AI]
Then, what is it?

270
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
It's Shangri-la.

271
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,583
What the hell is that?

272
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,416
How can something
like that fly anyway?

273
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,333
That thing has got
to be from the future.

274
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,708
Well, Tobi? What is it?

275
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,541
It's a ship known
as a Destructron,

276
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,250
sent here from Shangri-la.

277
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,625
It's a weapon used to
overlap and assimilate

278
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,500
all dimension into itself.

279
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,333
Now is not the time
to mess around!

280
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,333
What the hell does
that thing do?!

281
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:04,708
Eventually, this reality will
disappear into Shangri-la.

282
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,958
It's gonna do what?

283
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,208
Don't say it.
Haruka's who it wants.

284
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:14,125
I've seen this machine before...
I know I have...

285
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,208
Are you okay, Atori?!

286
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,208
[MIHO] Uh, that can't be real!
That has to be a mirage, right?!

287
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,083
Have you ever seen a mirage
that has that much detail, Miho?

288
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,500
It's fake, fake!
I don't want it to be real!

289
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
That thing's impossible!

290
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,541
You think that came
from the future too?!

291
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
The future?

292
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,666
Why is something like that
coming from the future?!

293
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,208
That's bad!

294
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,916
Pull yourself
together, will ya?!

295
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,583
[KUINA]
Dragon... Torque!

296
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,208
Who or what is this guy?!

297
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,000
[ISAMI]
Impossible!

298
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,041
[KUINA]
As long as I have you...!

299
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,666
Run, Haruka!

300
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,791
Let go of me!

301
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,541
Stop it, let her go!

302
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,125
[KUINA]
What's this?!

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,625
Yu, no!

304
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,416
[KUINA]
Noein... can you hear me?!

305
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,541
I've secured
the Dragon Torque!

306
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,416
Take me... Take me
with you to Shangri-la!

307
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,541
Noein!

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,291
Haruka...!

309
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,791
[KUINA]
Noein!

310
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,166
Now, release Haruka!

311
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,250
Look, it's him!

312
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,125
Karasu!

313
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,750
[KUINA]
How did you...?! You were...!

314
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,166
[KUINA groans]

315
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,625
[KUINA yells]

316
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,750
[KUINA]
I'm going to Shangri-la!

317
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,791
[NOEIN]
Don't meddle.

318
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000
[KUINA]
Huh?

319
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,666
[NOEIN] I told you,
I no longer have a need

320
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,458
for your pathetic assistance.

321
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,791
[KUINA]
But I successfully captured

322
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,458
the Dragon Torque for you!

323
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:49,833
[NOEIN] You are unneccesary
in this dimension. Get lost.

324
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,833
[NOEIN]
Miserable fool.

325
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,250
Huh.

326
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,541
[KARASU] So, you
manipulated Kuina, Noein.

327
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,625
And you murdered Fukuro!

328
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,125
Noein!

329
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,875
[NOEIN]
How unfortunate.

330
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:18,416
I wanted to bring you
so much more suffering.

331
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,291
You can also collapse and die.

332
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,791
Look at him.

333
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,583
[HARUKA] Know that
you'll never be forgiven.

334
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,458
I could never forgive you
for the things you have done.

335
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,458
Haruka...!

336
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,833
[NOEIN]
That's...

337
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,500
[NOEIN] Why, the time
is quite right, indeed.

338
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,708
Haruka!

339
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,083
Are you alright?!

340
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,250
I'm okay. Thank you.

341
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,375
[MIHO]
What?

342
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,250
[AI]
They're gone.

343
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,916
Hey, that ship's gone too!

344
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,541
Who cares about that?
Haruka is missing!

345
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,750
[YU]
There she is!

346
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,916
Hey everyone! I'm okay.

347
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,125
It was Karasu who saved me.

348
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,541
He did, huh?

349
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,083
But he said he never could
have done it without you.

350
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,791
That because you
were fighting for me,

351
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,791
he had extra strength
to come to my rescue.

352
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,791
I did that?

353
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,500
[ISAMI]
There's nothing on it!

354
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,208
Not this one or that one!

355
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,916
Nothing's on here! I got
a real good picture of 'em,

356
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,416
but it's not here!

357
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,458
What do you mean it's not
on there? What'd ya do to it?!

358
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,166
I have no idea!

359
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,125
Is it possible this whole
thing was a hallucination?

360
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,958
No way.

361
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,750
We all know we saw him.

362
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,666
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

363
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,333
That summer day's dream.

364
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,083
[HARUKA]
Of course I remember.

365
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:12,666
[KUINA] I will perform
a fix-reverse calculation.

366
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,333
[KOORIYAMA]
Even if we're killed,

367
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,875
we can ignore it if we have to.

368
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,083
[HARUKA]
Next Episode: Reminiscence.

369
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:25,458
Can you keep a happy
memory with you forever?
