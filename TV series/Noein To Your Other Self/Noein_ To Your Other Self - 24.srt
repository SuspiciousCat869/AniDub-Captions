Finish him off already!

00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,666
We can't waste any more
time in a dump like this!

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,291
Atori!

00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,833

I'll take these guys,
you get going.

00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,708
[ATORI]
Don't argue!

11
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,291
Go and save Haruka.

00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,875
Get going.

00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,416
Thank you.

00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, let's blow
Shangri-la back to Hell!

15
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,000
Come to me, Dragon Torque.

16
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,125
Come with me to a
world of nothingness.

17
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,916
Haruka!

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,583
Come...

00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,041
[NOEIN]
My Dragon Torque...

00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,541

What--?

21
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,291
Huh...?

22
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,500
All particles now
approaching light speed.

23
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,416
[SHINOHARA]
What is that?

24
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,791
Is the mountain on fire?!

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,166
The dimensions are
overlapping! My god!

26
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,375
[OPERATOR 1]
Critical mass!

00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,625
Outbreak, mark one-twenty.

29
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,666
These numbers are
incredibly abnormal!

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,000
What are your readings?

31
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,000
The instruments don't
seem to be right!

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
[OPERATOR 2] Computer
calculation speed falling.

33

[OPERATOR 4]
All coordinates lost.

34
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,958
[SHINOHARA]
Dammit! What is wrong?!

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:48,833
What the hell is it?! Everything
was going so well up until now!

36
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,000
The critical stage is
beginnin' to consume us...

37
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,083
[SHINOHARA]
Who gives a crap?!

38
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,916
They're just these
little particles!

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
More bad news:
the voltage is dropping!

40
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,041
The coil is starting to degauss!

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,291
[OPERATOR 3]
We've lost all satellites!

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,416
What, Dr. Mayuzumi?

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
The place site is in the process
of achieving a quantum state.

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,791
Don't screw with me!
What the hell does that mean?!

45
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,208
Soon, all existences will
become de-established and--

46
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,333
Better knock that off, now!

47
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,416
It's impossible for a
macro world like ours

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,750
to achieve a quantum state!

49
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,125
You're wrong,
but that's not all.

50
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,458
This may be leading to
the worst-case scenario.

51
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,458
Dimensional convergence...

52
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,958
When you forcefully establish
something that has not been

53
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,625
established in previous
dimensions then--

54
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,958
Then what, Doctor?!

55
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,208
[UCHIDA]
It will disappear.

56
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,583
[SHINOHARA]
Huh?!

57
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,833
By forcibly merging infinite
choices simultaneously,

58
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,416
a place site will occur,

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,666
forcin' the infinite
dimensions into convergence.

60
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,000
Everything drawn into
that place site will...

61
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,333
...disappear.

62
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,458

No!

00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,208
[OPERATOR 3]
What's that?!

65
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,041
It's that ring we saw before!

66
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,083
Well, why'd it have
to show up again?!

67
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,208
What is that thing?

68
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,166
Must be a mirage of some kind...

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,666
That's not right...

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,333
[AI] Look, the center of that
thing is starting to glow!

71
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,458
[ISAMI] I see something
there! Impossible...

72
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,500
Shangri-la, is that it?

73
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,333
[ISAMI] Hey, come on,
let's go up the mountain!

74
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,250
[AI] Okay, we can get a
better look from up there!

75
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,750

Hurry, hurry!

[YUKIE] Hey, where are
you going? Just hold on!

77
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,875
Huh?

78
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,750
Where am I?

79
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,583
Where is this place?

80
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,416
[TIME DRIFTER]
Haruka...

81
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,791

That's right.

You're here?

84
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,375
[TIME DRIFTER] The poor fellow.
He has chosen that dimension.

85
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,500
[TIME DRIFTER] It is a future
full of hate and sorrow.

86
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,000
Future?

87
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:50,041
Yes. It is one of many futures.

88
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,916
Then, what should I do?

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,125
[TIME DRIFTER]
That depends.

90
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,041
What sort of future
would you like to see?

91
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,458
Well, I know I don't
wanna see a sad future.

92
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,375
[TIME DRIFTER]
Multiple dimensions create

93
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,750
an infinite choice of futures,

94
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,083
so people can imagine
better existences.

95
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,250
[HARUKA] What if there
were only one future?

96
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,000
[TIME DRIFTER] Dimensions
without options would collapse

97
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,041
and cease to be.

98
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,708
[HARUKA]
Would... everyone disappear?

99
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,291
[TIME DRIFTER]
Yes.

100
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,041
The Earth and the sky
would disappear.

101
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,541
All would return to the void.

102
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,458
Well, then what should I do?

103
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,625
[TIME DRIFTER] From all the
dimensions, you were chosen.

104
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,166
How come?

105
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,791
[TIME DRIFTER] It is possible,
it didn't have to be you...

106
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,666
[TIME DRIFTER]
But you were the one chosen.

107
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,791
[HARUKA]
I'm going to decide?

108
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,250
[TIME DRIFTER] You must
listen to all the dimensions.

109
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,000
To the voices of
all living things.

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,375
Feel them.

111
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,500
I have to feel... everything?

112
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,916
This is the end!

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,458
It's the end of the world!

114
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,958
Everything's gonna disappear!

Everything's gonna
disappear, isn't it?

119
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,833
We don't know that for sure.
We need to go to the surface.

120
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,916
[LILY]
Huh?

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,458
All of us. We need
to see the world.

122
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,708
We must have the courage to
really look at our world again.

123
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,208
And then we will be
able to recognize it.

124
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,750
[CHILD A] You're late, Atori.
Where've you been?

00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,958
[CHILD B]
Sara says that supper's ready.

[ATORI]
Sara!

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,125
No! There's no way I
will disappear just yet!

129
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,500
It won't go that way!

130
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,250
[KOSAGI]
Is it hopeless?

131
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,500
Will Shangri-la swallow them?

132
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,333
There's got to be another way.

133
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,666
[TOBI] Take this,
you return to La'cryma.

134
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,833
[KOSAGI]
The storage battery...

135
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,041
It's too late to
return to La'cryma!

136
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,666
Right now,
every single dimension

137
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,583
is being drawn into the tide
of Shangri-la's causation.

138
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,083
Its causation?

139
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,708
If we can somehow
manage to oppose it,

140
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,625
there's the possibility
we may be able

141
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,166
to cancel the
Omni-dimensional integration.

142
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,041
We can push it back?

143
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,416
[KOSAGI] You mean destroy
the Reizu simulator?

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
[TOBI]
That's right.

145
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,708
[KOSAGI]
The existence descriptive data

146
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,708
for the world of
La'cryma will be lost!

147
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,083
[TOBI]
No it won't.

148
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,541
It's completely useless
to create a virtual observer

149
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,375
using the Reizu system.

150
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,500
To establish existence,
the most vital aspect

151
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:10,041
is that people observe
others and acknowledge them.

152
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,791
If people can recognize
and understand each other,

153
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,000
existence can be established.

154
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,875
Tobi...

155
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,333
[TOBI] I realized it when
I came to this dimension

156
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,625
and met Haruka.

157
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,416
I saw how people can
become established

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,583
by having their
existence recognized.

159
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,583
[ISAMI] Look out, comin'
through here! Excuse me!

160
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,666
Hey, the light's definitely
brighter over here!

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
And you can see it better!

162
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,416
And Haruka's trapped inside
that thing, isn't she?

163
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,333
Look, what's that?!

164
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,750
[ISAMI]
Those things are impossible!

165
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,458
Haruka's coming back to us,
I'm sure of that!

166
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,875
Of course she will.

167
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,875
Atori and Karasu are with her.

168
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,041
That's right. And Yu's
comin' back too. I believe it.

169
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,625
That is the Uroborus.

170
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,833
Huh? Wow...

171
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:43,250
[LILY] It's so pretty. I wish
you could see it, Mommy.

172
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,666
[MIHO] What do you see?
Describe it to me, Lily.

173
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,750
There's this huge ring
floating in the sky, and then,

174
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,625
you can see all this pretty
scenery inside of it.

175
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,333
[KOSAGI] I guess this
place is abandoned now.

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,666
[WOMAN]
What is that?!

177
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,291
All of the dimensions
are linked up.

178
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,583
[MIHO]
They're all coming this way!

179
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,125
[ISAMI]
Impossible!

180
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,291
[AI]
What now?!

181
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,750
They seem to be
looking right at us!

182
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,416
What the heck is that?

183
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Whatever it is,
it's really tough.

184
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,291
That's Atori!

185
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,458
It's him, he's come to help!

186
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,083
He said he would
protect us, didn't he?

187
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:41,458
[NOEIN cackles]

188
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,541
And here you are.

189
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:57,958
I have the powers of the Dragon
Torque to use as I see fit.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,250
[NOEIN]
The dimensions are now

191
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,750
on their way
towards integration.

192
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
[KARASU]
How could you?

193
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,000
The end of everything has begun.

194
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,541
And then, it's done.

195
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,958
Isn't that what you were
wishing for all along?

196
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,750
After all, we're one
and the same.

197
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:29,500
You feel it? All of
the pain, all the rage.

198
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,916
People are so foolish.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,416
I wish I had never come to know
the meaning of existence.

200
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,291
[ATORI]
Blast! This isn't working!

201
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,916
They are swarming like a virus!
They're everywhere!

202
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,833
[OPERATOR 1] Neither first
nor second system can reboot!

203
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,250
[OPERATOR 2]
Third system is down, too!

204
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know what's
happening here...

205
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,333
[OPERATOR 1]
But the particles are continuing

206
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,291
to accelerate, aren't they?

207
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,125
Why don't you try rebooting?

208
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,250
[OPERATOR 3]
What's going on?!

209
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,333
[OPERATOR 2]
There's two of me!

210
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,750
What the--?! This isn't real!

211
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,458
It appears as if all
dimensions are converging!

212
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,041
[UCHIDA]
Can't be!

213
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,833
[KOORIYAMA]
What's happening?

214
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,583
Uchida, is this
another after-effect

215
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,166
of this dimension thing?

216
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,583
[UCHIDA]
Kooriyama?!

217
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,166
[KOORIYAMA]
Is that... me?

218
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,250
It's chaos!

219
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm looking at another me!
This is nuts!

220
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,708
[KOORIYAMA] So this is what you
meant about rolling snake eyes.

221
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,000
So I guess there's another me
that just can't be shot.

222
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,125
Wh-What're you--?!

223
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,083
No! What're you gonna do?!

224
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,791
[KOORIYAMA] Shut up,
you annoying little bastard!

225
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,875
And apparently,
it hurts my hand to hit

226
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,958
this little twerp
in any dimension.

227
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,500
Thanks, Kooriyama.

228
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,291
Unfortunately, it's going to
take more than hitting Shinohara

229
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,625
to get us out of this.

230
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
Uh-huh.

231
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,083
[TOBI] There's still a way...
We can't give up...

232
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,791
[UCHIDA]
Tobi...

233
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,750
[MIHO]
It's Atori...

234
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,291
[AI] He's stopping those guys
from coming out of the circle!

235
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,583
That dude's just
totally awesome!

236
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:02,125
[HARUKA] I think that, really,
I was happy. In every dimension.

237
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,708
And because I met you,

238
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,458
I've always been happy.

239
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,458
But you're not like Karasu.

240
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,083
You forgot, didn't you?

241
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,750
I have never forgotten
what happened!

242
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:25,250
I can still remember the flames,
as if it were yesterday!

243
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,750
I have not forgotten
what I felt...

244
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:36,000
No! You have Yu's memories,
but you've forgotten them.

245
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:45,833
[YU] Haruka... Y'know, I think I
like it here better than Tokyo.

246
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,541
I'm more... relaxed.

247
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,916
[YU] It's been almost
four years... since you died.

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,166
Time flies...

249
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,625
[HARUKA]
The Haruka of this dimension

250
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,916
is no longer here either.

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,166
He has not forgotten me.

252
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,833
It's not true! I have
not forgotten you!

253
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,041
[HARUKA]
You are not like Karasu.

254
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,375
[NOEIN]
I haven't!

255
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,458
[HARUKA]
You've forgotten me...

256
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,000
[THE OTHERS A]
Stop this, now.

257
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,458
[THE OTHERS B]
Stop obliterating everything.

258
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,458
[NOEIN]
Shut up, scum!

259
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:33,125
You insignificant people
ran away from the pain of life!

260
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,750
All of you can rot away
in your imaginary paradise!

261
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,500
We must oppose the tide even
if we're the only dimension.

262
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,458
We must stop the Magic Circle

263
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,416
and pull out of
the quantum state.

264
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,666
Tobi, we're ready! I've gotten
the back-up computer booted up.

265
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,708
Miss Uchida.

266
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,791
I know.

267
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,333
When the Magic
Circle disappears,

268
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,916
I will need to
observe the Kooriyama

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,916
who wasn't shot in
order to... establish him

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,583
Hey, it'll be alright.

271
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,916
I'm thinkin' God'll give me
a good roll of the dice.

272
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,416
I cannot let them down!

273
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,250
Now!

274
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,625
The program has started running!

275
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,208
Dr. Mayuzumi!

276
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,000
Emergency shut down!

277
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,291
[NOEIN yells]

278
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,250
It can't be!

279
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,791
You won't go away...

280
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,000
[NOEIN] You can't possibly
hope to destroy me.

281
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,500
You know that you and I
are the same being.

282
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,333
You and I will
never be the same!

283
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,291
[NOEIN]
It can't be! All the dimensions

284
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,791
should've converged by now.

285
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,291
[YU]
I saw your past.

286
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:31,666
[YU] Perhaps I was your past.
But right now...

287
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,625
...you're not me!

288
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,708
If you were me, I wouldn't
have forgotten about Haruka!

289
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,000
I wouldn't have
killed Isami, either!

290
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,875
Yes, you would,
because you are me.

291
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,291
No! We are not the same person!

292
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,041
I will never
become what you are!

293
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,041
I won't give up on the future!

294
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,125
Your existence has not
been established by anyone.

295
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,291
You are nothing but an illusion!

296
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,375
I'm an illusion...?

297
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,000
Come with me, Haruka.

298
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,208
We'll go home together.

299
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,916
You're here!

300
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,708
[AMAMIKU]
The Uroboros is fading...

301
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,250
Oh no, Atori...

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,666
[CROWD]
What's that?

303
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,833
[CROWD]
Is that snow?

304
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,916
[ASUKA]
Snow?

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,166
[MIYUKI]
Blue snow?

306
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,458
Wow...

307
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,291
That's interesting.

308
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,958
I've never seen that before.

309
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,708
Atori...

310
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,583
[ISAMI]
It's beautiful.

311
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,625
[UCHIDA]
Kooriyama!

312
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, thank God!

313
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,166
Take it easy there, Uchida.

314
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,083
Tell me, did we avert the
dimensional convergence?!

315
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,083
[TOBI]
Dr. Mayuzumi...

316
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,416
It's alright...

317
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,041
The balance is
being maintained...

318
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,375
[MAYUZUMI]
Tobi!

319
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:57,375
May be there be happiness...
in your dimension's future...

320
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,250
[UCHIDA] Tobi! Kooriyama
is back to normal. He--

321
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,791
[UCHIDA]
...Tobi?

322
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,375
[NOEIN]
Who am I?

323
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:20,500
No one chose to recognize me
in any of these dimensions...?

324
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,041
My existence will not
be established...?

325
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,833
[THE OTHERS A]
The time of assembly has ended.

326
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,833
[THE OTHERS B] The place site
of selection is revived.

327
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,791
[THE OTHERS A]
Recognition has been restored.

328
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,291
You had no choice
in this matter...

329
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,250
I had control of everything...

330
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,791
[NOEIN] You will all be
back to this dimension...

331
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,083
[NOEIN]
...again...

332
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,833
What's this? Where am I?

333
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,750
[KARASU]
The dimensional horizon.

334
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,458
[HARUKA]
Karasu!

335
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,708
[KARASU]
The dimensions are restored.

336
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,333
The future has
gained infinite choice.

337
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:27,166
[HARUKA] So, the future's path
has not been decided, right?

338
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,416
[KARASU]
That's right, Haruka.

339
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,166
I'm glad!

340
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,916
Aren't you gonna stay with me?

341
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,083
[KARASU] I'll always be with you
and protect you. I swear it.

342
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,833
Will I see you again?

343
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,291
In fifteen years.

344
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,750
Ah, because you're Yu!

345
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,583
That's right.

346
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,791
Ah, Haruka!

347
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,125
Hey, I just heard
Haruka's voice!

348
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,333
[ISAMI]
Me too! She said she's with Yu!

349
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,666
[MIHO]
More blue snow.

350
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,875
[AI, ISAMI]
Huh?

351
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,125
Haruka.

352
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,291
Yu.

353
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,333
I-I, um...

354
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,916
[AI]
Haruka!

355
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,583
[ISAMI]
Yu!

356
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,083
[MIHO]
Haruka!

357
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,166
[ISAMI]
This is impossible!

358
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,291
[AI]
Haruka, you're alright!

359
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,583
[ISAMI]
Totally unbelievably impossible!

360
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,291
[YU] Isami, it's alright!
Don't worry!

361
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,250
[AI]
Thank goodness!

362
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,500
[ISAMI]
Im-possible!

363
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,750
[YU]
Really, it's alright!

364
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,291
[MIHO]
Hey!

365
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,250
[AI] Haruka, is Yu coming
back home from Tokyo?

366
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,750
[HARUKA]
It looks that way.

367
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:48,708
[MIHO] That's great! It's been
a long time, huh, Haruka?

368
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,250
[HARUKA]
But we always exchange e-mails.

369
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,458
[AI] Alright! I'll call Isami
and we'll all get together!

370
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,833
[MIHO]
Now you sound just as excited.

371
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,458
[HARUK] I'm just going
to swing by the church.

372
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,375
[AI]
Oh, okay. See ya, Haruka!

373
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,583
[MIHO]
Bye!

374
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,791
Karasu...

375
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,333
[HARUKA]
Yu is coming home soon.
