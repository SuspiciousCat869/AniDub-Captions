[FUKURO]
So, what's it gonna be?

2
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,208
[KARASU] If you try to
take the Dragon Torque,

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,083
I'll have to fight you.

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,041
[FUKURO] You've really
lost it, my old friend.

5
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,208
Do you really think
you can take me?

6
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,208
In the shape you're in?

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,000
I was hoping to avoid this.

8
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,875
Wait, look at that.

9
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,708
The wavering in this world
is getting a lot worse.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,791
[KARASU] Because La'cryma
interfered with it.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,458
You realize if this
dimension is blown apart,

12
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,125
the Dragon Torque
will be lost.

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,833
[KARASU]
I won't let that happen.

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,500
I'll protect Haruka.

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,375
I am not going to
let you take her.

[FUKURO chuckles]

17
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,083
Now that you've cut yourself
off from the pipeline,

18
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,708
you're eventually
going to die anyway.

It's your fault Haruka.

21
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,916
[FUKURO]
Well, after you're gone,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,625
we can take our time
securing the Dragon Torque.

23
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:39,250
I guess our epic battle
will have to wait, right?

Hey, wait just a minute!

Why did you just
force that recall?

31
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,458
I had an unexpected
situation to deal with.

32
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,541
But I had her. I was so close.

33
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,375
[KOORIYAMA] What's Shinohara
got such a big ego for?

34
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,583
He's just the president

35
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,375
of some small
telecommunications company.

36
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,833
[UCHIDA] Well, we're gonna
have to deal with it.

37
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,208
His company invested
one third of the funds

38
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,541
for the Magic Circle.

39
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,041
[KOORIYAMA]
Yeah, but thought your Ab-Com

40
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,333
is supposed to be
supervising the project.

41
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,333
Isn't that right?

42
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,708
[UCHIDA]
We're just a nuisance.

43
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,083
If he controls the
prelim investigation

44
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,916
than he's the one
who can proceed.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,750
He simply wants the
glory of performin'

00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,791
the quantum teleportation
test himself.

47
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,250
Quantum teleportation?

48
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,708
[UCHIDA]
If you make an alteration

49
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,958
to a single simultaneous
regenerative quantum,

50
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,625
then the same alteration
will occur to other quanta.

51
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,125
We call this
quantum teleportation.

52
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,375
It's a system that uses

53
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,458
the properties of
quanta to instantaneously

54
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,125
send large quantities
of information.

55
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,583
It's the Magic Circle Project

00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,166
the government is
workin' on now.

57
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,708
We took it further.
We directed our attention to

58
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,208
the theta particles
of quanta in particular.

59
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,333
They're probably the
smallest unit of matter.

60
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,916
The government
is thinkin' about

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,208
applying our research
to teleportation.

62
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,666
If it works, they say
it will change the world

63
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,125
in far greater ways than
the industrial revolution.

64
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,166
[KOORIYAMA]
Hmmm...

65
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,583
Quanta, huh?
Is it dangerous?

66
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,916
Theta particals influence

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,083
the location of
the quantum potential.

68
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,208
I'm really not following you.

69
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,500
To put in in layman's terms:
Dimensions become twisted.

70
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,458
They what?

71
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,583
I have a feeling that all
of the unexplained events

72
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,041
we're experiencing
are the result

73
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,916
of contact with
other dimensions.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,541
[KOORIYAMA]
Other dimensions?

75
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,416
Can you explain this so
that I can understand it?

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,791
Other dimensions, as in,

77
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,541
the multiuniverse interpretation
of quantum theory.

78
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,041
The multiplex
universal quadrophonic.

79
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,333
Who doesn't know about that?

80
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,208
God's not someone
who rolls the dice.

81
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,666
What's that mean?

82
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,166
It's just a metaphor
for people like you

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,708
who don't believe
in the uncertainity

84
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,875
of a quantum world.

85
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,500
[KOORIYAMA] Okay, now you've
completely lost me.

86
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,375
Let's suppose you
roll a single die

87
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,708
and it comes up a six.

88
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,291
I prefer ones myself.

89
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,083
They're more lucky.

90
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,250
[UCHIDA]
All right, a one it is.

91
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,083
So let's say you rolled a one,

92
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,250
but you also could have
rolled a four or a five.

93
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,666
All the odds are
exactly the same.

94
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,625
Do you follow?

95
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,958
[KOORIYAMA]
I guess so.

96
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,250
But what if there were worlds

97
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,666
where you rolled a four
and a five as well?

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,208
Huh?

99
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,208
[UCHIDA sighs]

100
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,833
You see, there are
countless worlds

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
where your countless
self is rolling

102
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,250
countless amounts of dice.

103
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,208
What? Are you tellin' me

104
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,625
that you believe
this sort of thing?

105
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,625
[UCHIDA] Let me try to
explain this to you.

106
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,333
The tiniest elementary quanta

107
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,333
that compose matter
are just too small

108
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,750
to be observed in
their natural state.

109
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,666
[KOORIYAMA] So you're
saying that the microscope

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,416
to see something that small
hasn't been invented yet?

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,625
[UCHIDA]
Actually, there's more to it.

112
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,041
[UCHIDA] In order for humans
to observe these objects,

113
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,125
we must hit it with light
and observe it's reflection.

114
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,416
However, the quanta are almost

115
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,291
the same size as the
photons that create light.

116
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,583
So hitting them with
light has a large effect

117
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
on the quanta we are observin'.

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
[KOORIYAMA] Okay, okay.
I understand that part.

119
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,958
You can't properly
observe this stuff.

120
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,458
But what does that
have to do with

121
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,541
these other worlds
being out there?

122
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,375
How does all that
figure into this?

123
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,208
[UCHIDA] Not bein' able
to observe them means

124
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,583
that we can't tell what state

125
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,083
the quanta are in
at any given time.

126
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,416
In other words, infinite
possibilities will exist.

127
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,291
What the hell does that mean?

128
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,916
[UCHIDA] Okay, uhmm, take
grains of sand on a beach.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,250
Even though we can't
see them all, they exist

130
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,666
in every dimension
on every beach,

131
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,791
but just maybe not
in the same place.

132
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,833
[KOORIYAMA] So you're saying
that although we can't see it

133
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,791
there's a possibility that it
exists in other dimensions?

134
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,333
[UCHIDA]
Take it further.

135
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,958
What if those grains of sand
were somethin' else entirely?

136
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,833
[KOORIYAMA]
Something else?

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,875
Yes, you see, all of the
matter in this world,

138
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,583
includin' you and I, are
made from accumulations

139
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,916
of these small quanta,

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,625
but they don't have to be
the same in each world.

141
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,208
[KOORIYAMA]
Hold on a second.

142
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,291
So you're saying that the
location of these things

143
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,791
isn't even definite,
so I might not even be me?

144
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,333
But I'm standing right here,

145
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,916
and this table and that glass
are right in front of me.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,416
I'm afraid that is
where the theories

147
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,666
of quantum physics become
kind of difficult to explain.

148
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,625
[UCHIDA]
Even if existance is steadfast

149
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,666
on an everyday macro level,

150
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,583
the moment it's taken to
the quantum micro level

151
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,000
it's existance
becomes ambiguous.

152
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,458
[KOORIYAMA]
You're giving me a headache.

153
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,916
[UCHIDA]
It's simple.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,916
If you believe this world
consists of unstable quanta,

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,708
then it's possible to believe
that this entire universe

156
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,833
is branchin' off
moment by moment

157
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,958
into infinte universes
with unlimited possibilities.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,583
So is that what
you were talking about

159
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,125
when you said there
were other dimensions

160
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,041
that are in existence
where I don't roll a one?

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,375
[UCHIDA] In quantum
mechanics there is a theory

162
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,125
known as the
multiverse interpretation,

163
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,125
in which countless
worlds are lined up

164
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,333
in an endless row
like opposin' mirrors

165
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,916
where countless selves
are rolling countless dice.

166
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,875
You seriously believe in

167
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,458
all this multi-quantum
universal crap, Uchida?

168
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,333
[UCHIDA]
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

169
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
We call them
alternate dimensions.

170
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,583
In a quantum world, there is
only one other coordinate

171
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,291
that will transcend
all of time and space.

172
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,291
The equation that
indicates that coordinate

173
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,041
is proof of the existance
of alternate dimensions.

174
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,375
Although it's existence
is strictly numerical.

175
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,458
Is there a possibility
that we could

176
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,583
travel to one of these places?

177
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,708
[UCHIDA]
It might be possible

178
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,166
if we could become
a quantum existence.

179
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,333
Becoming an uncertain
existence to travel

180
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,291
to an uncertain
alternate dimension

181
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,916
may theorectically be possible.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,666
[KOORIYAMA] I feel like
I have a bad hangover.

183
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,166
[UCHIDA] Look, a long time
ago people used to believe

184
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,291
the sun revolved
around the earth.

185
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,250
It took them a while
to accept the truth.

186
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,250
It just takes time.

187
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,208
When somethin' is
ingrained in people's brains

188
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,708
as common sense, it takes
time to change them.

189
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,083
Yes, it'll take me a while.

190
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,083
If the universe is really
how you think it is,

191
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,083
then what's gonna
happen after this?

192
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,416
[UCHIDA] The stability of the
quantum dimensions will be lost,

193
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,791
and every dimension will expire.

194
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,958
And everything will be gone.

195
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,041
[KOORIYAMA gasps]

196
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,541
[ISAMI] So your mom said you
don't have to study anymore

197
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,125
if you don't want to.

198
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,833
[YU]
Something like that.

199
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,125
[ISAMI] Then you should come
back to the soccer team.

200
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,833
[YU] I told you already.
It's not fun for me.

201
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,916
I'm not as good as you.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,125
[ISAMI] It's not like you
have to go pro or anything.

203
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,250
At the very least, you should
do it for your health.

204
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,750
[YU] What am I,
an old man? That's weak.

205
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,750
[ISAMI]
I'm just sayin'.

206
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,375
You don't have to have a reason.
Just play 'cause you like it.

207
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,375
[YU]
No thanks.

208
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,291
All right, then what
do you wanna do?

209
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,500
That's where I'm
having some trouble.

210
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,333
Huh?

211
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,333
I've been sitting here
trying to figure out

212
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,916
what I wanna do with my life.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,541
[ISAMI]
And?

214
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,958
[YU] I don't know.
I mean, soccer's okay,

215
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,958
but I'm not very good at it.

216
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,500
[ISAMI]
You gotta practice to get good.

217
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,458
[YU]
Dude, I have been practicing.

218
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,125
Since the third grade. I stink.

219
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,875
[ISAMI]
Well, yeah, but--

220
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,833
[YU] I just really don't think
I have the talent for it.

221
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,125
[ISAMI]
Hm...

222
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,375
I thought about music, art,

223
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,500
maybe a different sport,
but all that stuff's

224
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,333
for people who were born
with the talent to do it.

225
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,041
[ISAMI]
That's not true!

226
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,666
It is, but it's okay,

227
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,083
because I get what
my mom was saying.

228
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,875
The more you study,
the more your grades go up.

229
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,500
Even a no talent loser
like me can do that.

230
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,875
[ISAMI] Yeah, but you're
great at school. I'm not.

231
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,625
[YU]
That's because you don't try.

232
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,125
All you gotta do is
give up some play time.

233
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,583
So that's why...

234
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,958
[ISAMI]
Why what?

235
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,000
I think, I should just
take the entrance exams.

236
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,583
No way, dude! If you
go to school in Tokyo,

237
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,791
you won't be able to hang out
with any of us anymore.

238
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,041
I'm not happy about that either.

239
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,083
Then forget about
taking those dumb exams.

240
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,000
Just blow 'em off.

241
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,791
[YU]
Just grow up, would ya?

242
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
You can't always
have it your way.

243
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,000
You know you can do anything
if you put your mind to it!

244
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,375
[YU] That's not how
the real world works.

245
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,458
Shut up! Shut up! I just can't
take all this negativity!

246
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,666
You just suck!

to deplete your energy.

Hmmm...

00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,166
I was wondering what I'll
be doing 15 years from now.

Eh. 15 years from now?!

don't you think?

[HARUKA] Remember when
I was a little girl,

285
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,541
and I used to say I
saw ghosts everywhere?

286
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,000
Apparently what I was
seeing was other worlds.

Uh? Did you say "other worlds"?

it don't matter where you are,

315
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,625
you're still gonna
be good friends!

316
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,958
Say it! Don't spray it!

317
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,833
[TSUYOSHI]
Why you!

318
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,291
[TSUYOSHI] All I'm trying
is to give you some advice!

319
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,208
[ISAMI]
Ugh, that is impossible.

320
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,333
Huh? It's almost Obon time.

321
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,666
Auugh... Yeah...

322
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,916
[TSUYOSHI sighs]
We have to get ready

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,208
to visit Mom and Dad's graves.

324
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:24,416
Yeah, Fumiko told me she's
gonna make paper dolls again.

325
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,458
You're not gonna
do it this year?

326
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,541
I'm almost in
middle school, you know.

327
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,666
I got better things
to do than that.

328
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,875
Raargh!

329
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,125
Oh, I guess you're
all grown up now, huh?

330
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,208
[TSUYOSHI growls] We're goin'
to Mom and Dad's grave site

331
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,041
and tellin' 'em we're
good and Grandpa's good too.

332
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,291
[ISAMI]
Let's go!

333
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,791
[TSUYOSHI] Aww, c'mon.
You like this! Ha ha!

334
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
[KOORIYAMA] Uchida, don't
you think we shoulda gone

335
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,500
somewhere a little more
classy for our date?

336
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,166
It's more cooler in
here than it is outside.

337
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,583
[KOORIYAMA]
So, what d'you wanna do,

338
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,583
since we've been
ordered to stay home?

339
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,958
[UCHIDA] I kept going over
it in my head last night.

340
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,125
[KOORIYAMA]
And? What're you thinkin'?

341
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,375
[UCHIDA]
I'm now convinced

342
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,958
the Magic Circle Project
should be called off.

343
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,833
And what would that
accomplish anyway?

344
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,791
Doesn't Shinohara call
all the shots at Ab-Com?

345
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,833
There are other possibilites.

346
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,083
I need to get in contact
with Dr. Mayuzumi.

347
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,916
Who the hell is he?

348
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,041
Dr. Mayuzumi used to be the
Magic Circle Project leader,

349
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,500
but he decided to
resign six months ago.

350
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,000
Resigned?

351
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,208
I have a feelin' that he sensed
the danger of this project

352
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,083
and decided to walk away.

353
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,583
I'll never be absolutely sure

354
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,625
until I see him
and ask him myself.

355
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,791
So tell me, where exactly

356
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,375
is the good doctor
hiding out these days?

357
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,083
Unfortunately, nobody's heard
from him since he resigned.

358
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,291
I think he must have cut some
kind of deal with Shinohara.

359
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,208
And you really think someone
like that is gonna help us out?

360
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,000
Actually, I discovered
somethin' quite interestin'.

361
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,375
Yeah? What did ya find out?

362
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,791
After her parents divorced,

363
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,208
Haruka used her mother's
name instead of her father's.

364
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,541
Wait a minute!

365
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,541
Don't tell me her father's
last name is Mayuzumi?!

366
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,291
You hit the nail on the head.

367
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,125
So he's her father?

368
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,041
[UCHIDA] Yep! And he
goes to visit his daughter

369
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,583
every three months.

370
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,750
If he has any idea of
this project's risk factor,

371
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,375
I am positive that he would
come see his daughter.

372
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:22,208
[KUINA] Kosagi, I confirmed
your behavioral data.

373
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,375
You disobeyed orders

374
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,791
and attempted to destroy
the Dragon Torque.

375
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,500
By policy your actions would
merit severe punishment,

376
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,583
but we don't have have
time for that right now.

377
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,291
[KOSAGI gasps]

378
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,833
The moment that
Fukuro jumps into action,

379
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,416
we have to secure the Dragon
Torque without fail this time.

380
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,833
It shouldn't be difficult,
if we can eliminate Karasu.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,791
[phone chiming]

382
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,708
[AI]
Seriously?

383
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,625
What in the world does
Miho think she's doing?

384
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,625
She's always late!

385
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,041
Don't mess with me.

[phone buttons beeping

The little priss takes so long,

388
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,291
because she's spending
so much time primping.

Uhh...

Huh?

Hey, this is kinda weird
seeing you here like this.

Can I help you, sir?

I don't think I'm old
enough to be a "sir."

Hey, ease up on

00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,250
Huh?

He's just a little kid.

00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,458
Don't be so tough
on him, all right?

400
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:39,041
It must be hard to believe,
see me grown up like this.

401

I made that decision by myself!

Huh?!

about me. I mean it.

It was my call.

I've always done everything

[YU] But this is the first
time I've done something,

'cause I wanted to.

Yeah, sure, I gotcha.

Right back at ya, Isami.

429

[FUKURO]
I ran into Ai.

430
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:49,041
[FUKURO] Now I know why you're
drawn to this dimension.
