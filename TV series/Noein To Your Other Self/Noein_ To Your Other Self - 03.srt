1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,708
Whoa. What in the
hell is that thing?

2
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,125
Oh no, it's disappearing.

3
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,375
What's wrong with me?
I really am going mental.

4
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,000
Dammit.

5
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,416
Oh, Yu...

6
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,000
[HARUKA gasps]

7
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,541
What is that?!

8
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,625
[HARUKA]
Yu, hurry!

9
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,250
We have to leave here!

10
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,166
[HARUKA gasps]

11
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,375
Hello.

12
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,791
It's him...

13
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,375
[ATORI cackles]

14
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,416
[ATORI] You two,
together again. How cute.

15
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,166
[YU]
Let's go!

16
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,500
[ATORI]
That's enough.

17
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,666
Don't waste my time.

18
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,708
Stay back!

19
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,166
Stay away! Stay away!

20
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,041
You know you're
really pissing me off.

21
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,208
Well that explains it.
Imagine that...

22
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,208
running into the Karasu
of this dimension.

23
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,750
You wouldn't really wanna
cut me, would ya?

24
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,416
[YU whimpers]

25
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,958
Something like this?

26
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,875
[ATORI cackling]
[YU whimpering]

27
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,541
[YU screams]

28
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,208
[ATORI cackling]

29
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,291
What's the matter?
Are you done already?

30
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
Damn I hate children.

31
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,000
They're so annoying
and tiresome.

32
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,541
[YU yelps]

33
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,666
Yu!

34
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,166
Should I crush you?
Does that feel good?

35
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,666
[HARUKA]
Stop it! You're hurting him!

36
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,333
[ATORI gasps]

37
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,541
[ATORI]
I know those eyes.

38
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,375
You do possess the same
eyes that he does.

39
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,625
Those are the eyes that
infuriate my soul!

40
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,708
[ATORI groaning]

41
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,958
Not again...

42
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:36,708
Time for all Karasus in
every dimension... to perish.

43
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,625
No!

44
00:05:50,166 --> 00:06:02,125
[ATORI groaning]

45
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,916
[HARUKA] Yu! It's working!
Come on, let's go!

46
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,083
[HARUKA]
Hurry! Hurry!

47
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,708
[HARUKA]
Yu!

48
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,250
We still don't have complete
stability in this dimension.

49
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,750
[HARUKA]
So why's he after you?

50
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,833
[YU]
I don't know.

51
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,291
This doesn't make sense.
Why would anyone wanna kill me?

52
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,375
Who was that guy anyway?

53
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,375
He isn't even human.

54
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,500
[HARUKA]
So then...

55
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
What's that?

56
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,583
Do you hear that?

57
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,333
[banging]

58
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,583
What's that noise?

59
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,041
[YU, HARUKA gasp]

60
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,375
Look at the ceiling!

61
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,083
Haruka, hold on!

62
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,291
Huh?

63
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,833
[HARUKA, YU scream]

64
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,875
[YU panting]

65
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,458
Haruka, are you alright?

66
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,291
Yeah, Yu, I think I am.

67
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,458
[HARUKA gasps]

68
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,125
[HARUKA]
It's that guy again...

69
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,625
Yeah, you're right.

70
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,041
[ATORI]
You again?

71
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:20,291
Karasu... always taking credit
for other people's hard work.

72
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,416
Your glory days are over.

73
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,333
Starting right now.

74
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,250
[KARASU gasps]

75
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,125
Time to die.

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,625
[YU, HARUKA yelp]

77
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
Bad boy.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,291
You should not be using
Reizu to shield yourself.

79
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,958
[ATORI] You almost let
the Dragon Torque fall.

80
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:58,041
[ATORI cackles]

81
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,541
[KARASU grunts]

00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,125

[ATORI cackles]

84
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,708
Ha!

85
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,083
[YU]
This isn't good.

86
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,958
It's the end.
We're all gonna die.

87
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,000
[YU]
It's hopeless. We're done for!

88
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,125
[KARASU]
Shut up!

89
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,583
If you don't wanna die,
then fight!

90

Yu!

91
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,208
I can't do it, okay? I can't.

92
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,458
You are so pathetic.

93
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,333
Is that all you're
good at? Giving up?

94
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:59,458
Come on, you coward!
Show me some guts!

95
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,833
I can't. I'm too scared.

96
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,083
[ATORI grunting]
[KARASU groaning]

97
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,666
I'm going to die now.

98
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,541
Then die!

99
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,166
[KARASU] Anyone who won't
fight for their life should die!

100
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,458
Is that all you've got?
I expected more from you.

101
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,083
[ATORI] I've always hated
that look on your face.

102
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,375
It makes me want to vomit.

103
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,958
[KARASU gasps]

[YU, HARKU screaming]

00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:07,875
[ATORI yelling]

108
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,500
Yu...

109
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,541
Are you okay, Haruka?

110
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,833
Uh... Yu... you're bleeding.

111
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,125
The reading has disappeared.

112
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,791
Are you sure that's right?
Maybe you should check it again.

113
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,791
Maybe you're mistaken.
We could just head back.

114
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,041
--It's getting' kinda late.
--It's not a mistake.

115
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,958
I am absolutely sure
the source is here...

116
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,583
[UCHIDA]
...somewhere on this mountain.

117
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,458
[HARUKA]
Doesn't it hurt?

118
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,666
[YU] No, it's fine.
It's not bleeding anymore.

119
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,541
[HARUKA]
Are you sure you're alright?

120
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,416
Would you please stop
asking me that?

121
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,666
[HARUKA] But your head...
and I'm sure that your feet

122
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,375
must be bothering you too.

123
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,458
[YU]
Would you quit buggin' me?

124
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,291
You can be so stubborn.

125
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,916
[HARUKA]
Hey, here's the road!

126
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,125
[YU]
Haruka!

127
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,583
[HARUKA]
We made it!

128
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,083
[YU]
Haruka!

129
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,500
[KOORIYAMA, UCHIDA gasp]

130
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,166
[KOORIYAMA]
What the...

131
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,666
So lucky!

132
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
[YU]
Haruka, are you crazy?

133
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,916
Excuse me, sir.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,458
Could you please give us a ride

135
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,583
down to the bottom
of the mountain?

136
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,833
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?

137
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,833
[HARUKA gasps]
Wait, I know you.

138
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,208
Huh?

139
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,666
[OPERATOR]
Can you hear me?

140
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,500
[ATORI groans]

141
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,208
[OPERATOR] One bird has
returned to the hen house.

142
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,500
[KUINA] Damn Atori.
He's certainly wreaked

143
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,375
his share of havoc.
I didn't imagine that he'd be

144
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,166
forcefully retrieved
because of an irregularity.

145
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,541
[FUKURO] Kuina, what about
the Dragon Torque?

146
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,708
There's no need
for us to panic, Fukuro.

147
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,708
The bigger danger is that
we're leaving our marks

148
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,125
here in this dimension.
The strain of our presence here

149
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:40,875
is already starting to show.
First and foremost, we must

150
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,291
erase all proof of
our existence here.

151
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,375
Then we need to locate Karasu.

152
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,125
And obliterate every trace...

153
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,708
[KUINA groans]
[TOBI] Kuina!

154
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,291
[KUINA] It's fine. The leg
teleported back. Move on.

155
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,750
It appears that my body...
is not entirely compatible

156
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,708
with this dimension.

157
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,750
[MIYUKI] Did you really think
I would believe that?

158
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,333
Why were you out on the street
at this time of night?

159
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,541
I feel ashamed
to be your mother.

160
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,208
You are absolutely forbidden

161
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,625
from leaving this house
except for cram school.

162
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,416
And I will take you to and
from that school myself.

163
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,333
[HARUKA]
And then the light flew around.

164
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,000
What do you think it was?

165
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,791
[ASUKA]
Hey, hold still.

166
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,166
Well, you're bound to run into
things like that if you go

167
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,500
wandering around
at this time of night.

168
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,666
Ow.

169
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,583
[ASUKA]
Okay, all done.

170
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,708
And remember, summer break
doesn't mean you can

171
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,458
run around outside
at all hours.

172
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,208
So you don't believe me?

173
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,541
Huh?

174
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
[HARUKA]
I'm not lying, you know.

175
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,458
Haruka, I used to fantasize
a lot back when I was your age.

176
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,416
I wished for something
exciting and magical

177
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,458
to happen almost everyday, too.

178
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,333
But I'm not lying about this.

179
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,625
Forget it. I'm going
to take a bath.

180
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,250
[HARUKA] That man's name
was Karasu, right?

181
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,291
I wonder if he's gonna be okay.

182
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,916
[HARUKA sighs]

183
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:53,541
[phone ringing]

184
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,291
[ASUKA]
Hey, it's me.

185
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,625
[UCHIDA]
Those children we picked up

186
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,541
didn't appear to be lyin' to us.

187
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,916
But there are no signs of
destruction anywhere, right?

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,375
Well, would you stop
worrying about it?

189
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,000
Just relax for a minute and
enjoy the view of the city.

190
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,541
[TOBI] The restoration of the
demolished space was successful.

191
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,666
It's perfect for us.

192
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,750
[FUKURO]
Kosagi, have you located Karasu?

193
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,416
[KOSAGI]
I have a reading, but I can't

194
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
lock down his coordinates.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
[FUKURO] But is he still
in this dimension?

196
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,541
Yes. Of that I am certain.

197
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,541
He may be very weak.
I think that's why

198
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,333
his coordinates may be
difficult to ascertain.

199
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,541
Ahh! Stop it! Stay back!

200
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,250
Dragon Torque! Stay back!

201
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,166
[VOICE 1]
He's become deranged.

202
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,833
[VOICE 3] He must be
returned to full strength.

203
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,083
[VOICE 2] Surgery is risky
with this type of derangement.

204
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,333
[VOICE 3]
The Juoh Kai is demanding.

205
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,416
There will always be risks.

206
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,041
[VOICE 1] So, this is all
for the absolute coordinates?

207
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,708
[ATORI] If it comes...
If it comes La'cryma...

208
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,416
La'cryma will be...

209
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,958
...completely obliterated!

210
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,250
No! No, stop it!

211
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,416
I don't wanna die!

212
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,833
Stop! Stop!
Don't take me away! No!

213
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,791
[MIHO] I can't find any mention
of it in the newspaper.

214
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,041
I looked and looked.

215
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,541
[HARUKA]
That is so weird.

216
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,041
[MIHO] It's not on the radio
or television news either,

217
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,500
and I haven't seen anything
about it on the internet.

218
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,041
I surfed this morning.

219
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:56,416
[AI] And anyway... the ropeway
looks fine to me.

220
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,083
Yeah, that's the thing.

221
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,916
You know what? When you were
young, I remember you used to

222
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,750
freak about about
seeing things too.

223
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,666
What? Ghostly visions?

224
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
[HARUKA]
It wasn't like that.

225
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,375
And it wasn't that long ago that
I stopped seeing those things.

226
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,000
[AI] By the way...
why was that ghost after Yu?

227
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,250
I guess I'm not
really certain why.

228
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,041
But it attacked him
the other night as well.

229
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,458
[MIHO] What?
[AI] The other night?

230
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,458
Oh yeah. After we got
separated at the graveyard.

231
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,625
Haruka, you were alone
in the graveyard

232
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,875
that entire time with Yu?

233
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,541
[AI]
Hey... are you two going out?

234
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,416
Huh? No, no, no, you're wrong!
We're not dating or anything.

235
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,333
I swear to you that we're just
childhood friends, that's it.

236
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,708
If you're not dating Yu,
then what were you doing?

237
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,708
I mean, why were you
alone with him?

238
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,500
Nothing in particular really...

239
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,333
[MIHO]
That's not fair, Haruka!

240
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,416
Huh?

241
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,291
You can't have him, he's mine!

242
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,125
I've had a crush on him
for a long time!

243
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,500
[HARUKA, AI yelp]

244
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,458
[MIHO] Oh, what a shock.
I don't think I'll recover.

245
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,458
[AI]
What? Are you serious, Miho?

246
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,416
It just breaks my heart. But I
guess I could let you have him

247
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,416
all to yourself...
because we're such good friends.

248
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,458
It's really not
like that at all.

249
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,333
There's only one choice.
I'll move on

250
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,875
and find someone else to love.

251
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,500
That's great! Spoken like
a true best friend.

252
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,875
You can do it, Miho!

253
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,458
Yeah!

254
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,125
[MIYUKI] Please do not see
my son for the time being.

255
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,708
[MIYUKI]
I'm sure you understand.

256
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,541
This is an
important time for him.

257
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,083
[HARUKA]
U-Um...

258
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,750
[MIYUKI]
Goodbye.

259
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,583
[HARUKA]
Oh...

260
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,041
Yu...

261
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,291

[HARUKA]
Huh?

267
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,750
Where am I?

268
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,916
I know this place...

269
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:53,500
[YU] One... two... three...
four... five... six...

270
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,500
[HARUKA] I used to play here
with Yu when we were little.

271
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,875
[HARUKA gasps]

[HARUKA gasps]

[HARUKA]
Ka-Karasu?

275
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,541
Are you the one who called
me here to this place?

276
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,458
Please, I need some water.

277
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Now.

278
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,041
[HARUKA gasps]

279
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,708
[KARASU]
Get me some water.

280
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,791
Get water.

281
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,916
[HARUKA]
Here you go.

282
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,916
[HARUKA]
Um, would you like more, Karasu?

283
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,291
Alright, I'll go
get some more then.

284
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,625
[HARUKA gasps]

285
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,625
Uh...

286
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,375
Let's go together... Haruka.

287
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,750
You're after Yu again?

288
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,708
Well done, Karasu.

289
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,541
Yes, you managed to capture
the Dragon Torque.

290
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait, who is the Dragon Torque?

291
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,375
[KARASU]
Yu has never been our target.

292
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,916
Huh?

293
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,750
You're the one.... Haruka.

294
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,500
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

295
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,916
That summer day's dream.

296
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,291
[KUINA]
Noein, why are you here?

297
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,208
Haruka will
eventually disappear.

298
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,583
I hate you, Haruka!

299
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:24,458
[HARUKA]
Next: "Friends."

300
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,875
Don't cry.
