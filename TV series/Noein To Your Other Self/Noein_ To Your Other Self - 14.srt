Hello, Dad.

[MAYUZUMI]
Did you say "Dad"?

20
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,541
I think you have

[HARUKA]
Mh-mm.

29
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,916
[ASUKA]
But that's not possible.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,500
[HARUKA]
Yeah, I know that.

31
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,291
That telephone doesn't
even work anymore.

32
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,541
No one's even used that phone
since before Grandma was born.

33
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,958
What? It hasn't been
used for that long?

34
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
The last time it was used

35
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,958
was when your great
grandfather was alive.

36
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,666
[HARUKA] I really don't
think I was dreaming.

37
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,375
[ASUKA]
I guess it could happen.

38
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,625
[HARUKA]
Huh?!

39
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,083
Actually, I do remember
that phone ringing once

40
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,416
when I was a kid.

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,750
[HARUKA]
Yeah, right, Mom.

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,208
[ASUKA]
No, I'm serious.

43
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,083
Was I in high school, or was
I even younger than that?

[phone ringing]

45
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,833
[ASUKA] I just figured
I was half asleep.

46
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,583
I mean, there is no way that
an unconnected phone can ring.

47
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,166
[HARUKA]
Yeah, that's true.

48
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,166
Huh...

49
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,208
Did you do that?

50
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,916
I drew it a long time ago,
when I was in college.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,666
It's really
pretty bad, isn't it?

52
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,291
Why are you throwing it out?

53
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,583
It's silly to hang onto all
these pictures, isn't it?

54
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,583
No, it's not. I'll keep 'em.

55
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,708
Mm. All right, then.
They're yours.

56
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,041
[HARUKA]
Thanks!

57
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,958
Hey, these other ones
are pretty cute also Mom.

58
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,541
Look at this! It's so adorable!

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,166
[ASUKA]
Okay, enough of that.

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
We have a lot
of cleaning to do.

61
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,958
Miss Yukie will be here soon.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,333
Sorry about the short notice,

63
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,708
but these enviromentalists
have nowhere else to stay.

64
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,416
[ASUKA] Oh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,583
We have an extra room.

66
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,000
[YUKIE] I really can't
thank you enough.

67
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,041
[ASUKA]
Oh, it's nothing.

68
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,000
So this is a
non-profit organization?

69
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,041
Yes, we're studying the
migration of local birds.

70
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
It's really a great place, Tobi.

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,916
I can even see the ocean.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,250
Yes, I know.

73
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,666
How about we go for a walk
once I'm finished here?

74
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,666
That sounds like fun.

75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,750
Hello there, everyone.

76
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,541
[YUKIE]
Didn't take you guys long.

77
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,166
Oh, Miss Yukie, you're here.

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,541
[MIHO laughs]
Wow! This is great!

79
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,708
It's so bright
and cheery in here!

80
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,208
It was such a waste
to use it as a storage room.

81
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,958
You agree, don't you, Atori?

82
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,125
Okay.

83
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
[ISAMI] This is definitely
the right house.

84
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,583
They wouldn't all fit
at Miss Yukie's place.

85
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,666
[YUKIE] And excuse me for
having a cramped apartment.

86
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,041
[ISAMI]
I didn't mean it that way.

87
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,875
So he decided not to come here?

88
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,083
Do you mean Karasu?

89
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,958
I think he just
stepped out for a minute.

90
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,208
I don't understand why

91
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,333
he couldn't just stay
here with all of you.

92
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,583
Out of the question.

93
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,916
I think having him here
would cause suspicion.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,041
He's too intense looking
to pose as an enviromentalist.

95
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,375
Totally, you're right.

96
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,916
I mean, he always has this
scary look on his face.

97
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,500
Crap!

98
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,083
[KARASU] Will this be a
sufficient place for everyone?

99
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,375
Yes, probably.

100
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,250
Although, it'll take
a little while to set up.

101
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,666
Is it okay for you
to be up and around?

102
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,500
Mh-mm.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
What's your problem?

104
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,041
Nothing.

105
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,250
Hey, I brought some stuff.

106
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,416
You know, I could
use a little help here.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,458
Karasu, where have you been?

108
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,666
You just got better,

109
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
so you shouldn't go
outside too much yet.

110
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,916
[YU]
Uh, Haruka?

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,041
[HARUKA]
Huh?

112
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,000
Can I have some tea?

113
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, make sure you
pass it around to everyone.

114
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,583
Huh? You mean me?

115
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,375
[HARUKA] Yeah, make sure
everyone gets some.

116
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,416
Fine. Whatever.

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,833
[HARUKA]
We have snacks too.

118
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,916
[AI]
C'mon, Isami. Help out already.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
[ISAMI]
Yeah, yeah, all right.

120
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,458
[YUKIE]
Tobi, is that good enough?

121
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,291
[TOBI] Well, this laptop
is a real antique,

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,041
but I'll try to compensate
by re-programming it.

123
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,375
That happens
to be the fastest,

124

most up-to-date
model made, you know.

125
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,250
[YU]
Are you sure about this?

126
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,416
Sure about what?

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,125
Come on, you know
what I'm saying.

128
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,541
[ISAMI, AI yelp]

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,541
[AI]
Whoa, they're floating.

130
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,958
[ISAMI]
That's impossible.

131
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,291
[YUKIE]
Is this some kind of magic?

132
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,958
[MIHO]
Move over, David Copperfield.

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,291
Okay, I'm finally in.

134
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,166
[AI]
Wow, is that beautiful.

135
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,625
[ISAMI]
Even more impossible.

136
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,041
Huh?

137
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,375
What is Tobi doing with that?

138
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,958
Finding something for me.

139
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,833
Well then, how come
you're not helping her?

140
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,583
Because Tobi's
a lot better at it.

141
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,583
Oh, I see.

142
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,458
[ISAMI]
Hmm?

143
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,833
Where ya headed, dude?

144
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,375
[YU]
Bathroom.

145
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,708
Huh?

146
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,000
[HARUKA]
Hey. Is something wrong?

147
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,791
You've been acting
kinda weird all day.

148
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,958
[YU]
Let's go to Tokyo.

149
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,458
What?

150
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,250
[YU] I don't think we should
be anywhere near those guys.

151
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,083
Do you really wanna get
dragged into more weird stuff?

152
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,166
Well, I don't think running
away is gonna help anything.

153
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,916
Hey, that's so not true!

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,416
If we got to Tokyo,
then we can find your father,

155
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,166
and we can get him to help us.

156
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,375
Hey, yeah, that's right.

157
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,375
My dad's coming over
to visit this Saturday.

158
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,750
[YU]
Huh?

159
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,375
He usually tries to make it
in every three months.

160
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, that'll be a nice
time for ya. Have fun.

161
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,250
Would you stop?
I can't go anywhere.

If I really am the source of
all this, then running away

163

to change anything.

So I'll just stay
here with Karasu.

I just don't think you should
be so trusting of this guy.

Ah! How come you're always

talking about Karasu
in that way?

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,458
Wait a sec...
None of this is right.

324
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,416
So I suppose all of this
is my fault,

325
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,833
is that what
you're trying to say?

326
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,833
Will you just give me
a break already?

327
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,583
It's all my fault, isn't it?

328
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,083
[ASUKA] You're always
trying to blame m--

329
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,333
[MAYUZUMI]
Enough!

330
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,416
No, stop it! That's not right!

331
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,083
[TIME DRIFTER] Which past
do you want to see, Haruka?

332
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,416
[HARUKA]
It's you.

333
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
As you wander through
the countless dimensions,

334
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,916
which exist in the past,

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,208
ask yourself: what is it exactly
that you are searching for?

336
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,666
No matter where, or how much,

337
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,208
you exaimine your past,
it will never change.

338
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,125
But that's not true.

339
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,541
[MAYUZUMI]
We'll talk about it later.

340
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041
I have to go. Bye.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,958
[ASUKA] You don't even
wanna talk to me anymore.

342
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,500

343
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,750
[MAYUZUMI]
This is Mayuzumi.

344
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,500
Did you say "Dad"?

345
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,333
I think you have
the wrong number.

[HARUKA gasps]

348
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,916
[ASUKA sobbing] Augh!
I wish I had never met you!

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,916
Mom, don't say that.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,583
Believe me! If I could
do it over again,

351
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,791
I would not have you in my life!

352
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,791
[HARUKA] I don't understand
what's going on.

353
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,458
This is your past.
It will never alter.

354
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,041
And yet, you continue
to search in spite of this?

355
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,916
How long do you plan
to keep searching?

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,541
Until they stop fighting
and patch things up.

357
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,916
[TIME DRIFTER]
You don't understand.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,875
That past is not one that
is linked to your dimension.

359
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,750
Huh? Why not?

360
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,750
[TIME DRIFTER]
Because this is no more

361
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,333
than an approximate dimension.

362
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,083
[ASUKA sobing]
I wish I wasn't so clumsy.

363
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,125
If I hadn't tripped that day,

364
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,291
we would have never met.

365
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,166
That one day...

366
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,500
[COLLEAGUE] Take care of
tomorrow's report, will ya?

367
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,083
[MAYUZUMI] No problem, but
you're buying lunch, all right?

368
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,500
[COLLEAGUE] Yeah, whatever.
Okay, it's on me.

369
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,375
See you later.

370
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,125
[MAYUZUMI]
Later.

371
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,916
[HARUKA]
Dad?

372
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,833
Uh. Huh?

373
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,333
[MAYUZUMI]
Wow! These are great!

374
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,250
Huh? You think so?

375
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,583
Yeah, really nice.

376
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,458
Hey, this is especially cute.

377
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,875
[ASUKA]
Oh, thanks.

378
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,166
[MAYUZUMI]
Did you draw these?

379
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,500
Um, yes, I did.

380
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,333
[MAYUZUMI] Do you mind
if I look through them?

381
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,166
[ASUKA]
Go ahead. I guess it's okay.

382
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,583
Your use of color
is really great.

383
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
[ASUKA]
Oh, thanks.

384
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,333
[MAYUZUMI] I think
I like this one the best.

385
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,000
Cute puppy.

386
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,791
Well, actually, that's a cat.

387
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,333
[MAYUZUMI laughs]
Of course, I knew it was a cat.

388
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,125
I'm just messin' with ya.

389
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,708
Oh... Heh...

390
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,000
[MAYUZUMI]
This one's incredible.

391
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,291
The rendering style is great.

392
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,458
Do you study art?

393
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,875
My major is traditional
Japanese art.

394
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,208
What about you?

395
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm studying quantum data
processing engineering.

396
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,291
Wow! That sounds like an
incredibly difficult major.

397
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,500
You don't really look like
the geeky engineer type.

398
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,500
Why, thank you, but that's
actually what I am.

399
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,083
Hey! This one's
really nice as well.

00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,291
A tasmanian devil!

00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,666
Hmph. Nice try.

402
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,666
It's a raccoon.

403
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,166
Ha! I'm playin' with ya.

404
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,416

[BOTH laugh]

406
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,666
[TIME DRIFTER]
I'm sure you can find a past

407
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,416
where they never met
in some other dimension.

408
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,625
Just know, that
doing so would have

409
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,250
no meaning for you in any way.

410
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,791
[TIME DRIFTER]
Because they will never lead

411
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:20,791
to the dimension in which
you actually exist.

412
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,208
You're saying I can't
change the past?

413
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,083
[TIME DRIFTER]
Mm-hm.

414
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,333
I think that's really okay.

415
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,583
They really got along
great back then.

416
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,416
[TOBI] This dimension
is getting more unstable

417
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,625
than I predicted.

418
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,125
This disturbance...
I've felt this before.

419
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,750
I know. It's exactly like it was

420
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,416
before Shangri-la began
its intervention on La'cryma.

421
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,333
[ATORI] We're all going out
for another walk tomorrow.

422
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,125
[TOBI] That sounds like
a great idea, Atori.

423
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,916
I just can't wait.

424
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,458
[MAYUZUMI]
What's wrong Haruka? What is it?

425
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,291
You don't usually call
this late at night.

426
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,791
Now don't tell me you're
planning to cancel our date?

427
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,000
No way, Dad.

428
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,458
I just felt like
talking to you. That's all.

429
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,791
Can I ask you something?

430
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,041
Do you think you might
still be in love with Mom?

431
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,416
[MAYUZUMI]
Where did that come from?

432
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,666
Just tell me.

433
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,416
I promise I won't tell
Mom what your answer is.

434
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,541
[MAYUZUMI]
I still love her.

00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,291
[HARUKA]
Really? You do?

436
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,750
[MAYUZUMI]
But I don't think your mother

437
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,583
will ever forgive me.

438
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,291
Can I ask her that?

439
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,916
[MAYUZUMI] No. You promised
you wouldn't tell.

[HARUKA]
I'm sorry.

Oh, I almost forgot.

Is there anywhere

when we get together?

I'd like to go for a boat ride.

00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,708
[MAYUZUMI] Ha ha.
That sightseeing boat again?

446
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,958
We did that the last time.

447

[HARUKA] Oh, right.
Then, the ropeway!

[MAYUZUMI] All right, if that's
what you wanna do, sweetie.

Can you hear me? Are you there?

Please, don't say
anything and just listen.

I'm dreaming again...

[MAYUZUMI] Haruka, have you
started seeing ghosts again?

Karasu is not an illusion!
