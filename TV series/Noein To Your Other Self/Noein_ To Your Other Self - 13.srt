00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,875
Hey, Tobi?

00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,000
[phone ringing]

3
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,375
Huh?

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,375
It's Haurka.

5
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,041
Hey, what's wrong?

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,708
Huh? What'd you say?

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,541
Hey, calm down, will ya?

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,708
Karasu? Where are you right now?

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,583
[HARUKA]
Karasu, you have to hold on.

10
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,000
Karasu...

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm just glad you're all right.

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,041
Please don't die.

13
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm trying, Haruka.

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,333
[KARASU]
Where are you, Haruka?

15
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,583
[HARUKA]
Here I am. I'm right here, okay?

16
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,041
I'm right here.
Please stay with me.

17
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:15,291
Haruka, I'm sorry
I failed you once again.

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,666
Don't say that!

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,291
[YU]
Haruka!

20
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,958
Hey! Haruka!

21
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,916
[HARUKA]
No! Don't, Karasu.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,791
You said you would
always protect me.

23
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,916
Please, you gotta help him.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,833
He's dying, Yu!

25
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,250
[HARUKA]
Help me!

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,500
[YU gasps]

27
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,041
[YU]
He's...

28
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,166
He's not even human!

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,708
We have to get
away from him now!

30
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,791
[HARUKA]
No!

31
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,333
Will you just listen to me?

32
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,291
You're putting yourself
in all kinds of danger

33
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,041
--just by being close to him!
--That's not true!

34
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,666
[HARUKA] You're wrong.
He tried to protect me.

35
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,541
[HARUKA]
That's how he got hurt.

36
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,458
But Haruka...
I don't think that...

37
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,125
[HARUKA]
Yu...

38
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,791
Since you're Karasu,
I know that

39
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,958
you'll be my protector
now, won't you?

40
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,000
Haruka, I...

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,125
[KUINA] Fukuro's Reizu
has completely disappeared.

42
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,208
[KOSAGI]
What?

43
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,625
[KUINA] That's the
observer's conclusion.

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,083
[KOSAGI gasps]
Did Karasu do it?

45
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,750
Is he responsible
for Fukuro's death?

46
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,708
I hate that bastard.

47
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,916
He has killed his friend

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,291
in order to pursue
the illusion of a girl.

49
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,083
If this continues,
then it won't be very long

50
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,833
before La'cryma simply
surrenders itself to Shangri-la.

51
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,166
[KOSAGI]
It's the Dragon Torque.

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,416
If we could just bring
her to our dimension.

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,583
Don't take things
into your own hands!

54
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,083
We're the only ones left here

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,166
who can still travel between
all the different dimensions.

56
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,791
[TOBI]
Are you okay, Atori?

57
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,791
Hey, Atori.

58
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,833
Who are you?

59
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,166
Who am I?

60
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,500
Huh?!

61
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,583
[YUKIE]
Hey, you're not trying to pull

62
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,375
some kind of a practical
joke on me, are you?

63
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,166
[YU]
I don't know how to explain it.

64
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,583
I don't really
understand it either.

65
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,208
[YU] But I think,
he doesn't seem to be

66
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,250
such a bad guy after all,

67
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,625
so I just wanted
to help him out.

68
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,666
We need your help, Miss Yukie.

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,208
I'm so sorry, but I really
don't know what to do.

70
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,500
Isn't she gonna be
a little suspicious

71
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
if we just show up at
her house outta nowhere?

72
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,208
I'm afraid we don't have
time to worry about that.

73
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:14,541
I have to get in contact with
Dr. Mayuzumi immediately.

74
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,958
Do you think that
he can handle this?

75
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,583
Yeah, he'll be fine.
Miss Yukie is already there.

76
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,500
--[MIHO] Hey, Isami--
--[AI] Miho, over here!

77
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,416
You should go this way.
It's a lot shorter.

78
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,083
Where the heck is he going?

00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,916
Gosh, I'm sorry!

00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,958

00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,291
Ah!!

00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,666
It's Sara.

86
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,833
So this is where
you've been hanging out?

87
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,666
Let's do this.

88
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,166
It is her!

all over for you.

00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,458
Stop worrying your big brother.

96
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,333
[ISAMI]
Huh??

97
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,583
Sara...

98
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Nnnnngh! Let go
of me you weirdo!!

99
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,541
You freaky, child molesting,
pedophile, idiot!

100
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,708
[AI]
Yeah! Just back off!

101
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,833
Sara?

102
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,458
This guy's one taco short
of a combo platter.

103
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,958
No kidding...

104
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,000
What's the matter with you, pal?

105
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,166
And my name is not Sara!

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,166
You're not... my sister?

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,666
How is that... possible?

108
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:44,500
I think he's getting you mixed
up with his little sister, Sara.

109
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,666
I promise, he won't
hurt any of you.

110
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,666
I'll make sure of it.

111
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,833
He's really not such
a bad guy, actually.

112
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,166
Yeah, I think you're right.

113
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,958
I'm telling ya,
they're dangerous!

114
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,083
You're like, totally
freaking out, dude.

115
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,916
You're such a chicken, Isami.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,541
Why don't you
guys believe me?

117
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,833
Hey, where were
all you guys going

118
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,250
in such a hurry anyway?

119
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,333
Uh?! Are you crazy?

120
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,625
Why the heck did you
bring them here, Isami?

121
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,833
Eh... Heh... Heh...
It just happened.

122
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,583
[YU] What in the world
were you thinkin'.

123
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,083
See? I told you not
to bring them here.

124
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,875
I'm telling ya, there's
nothing to worry about.

125
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,500
[AI] I don't think these
guys wanna hurt us.

126
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,791
He's not gonna hurt anyone now.

127
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,541
It appears as though he's
lost his memory completely.

128
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,208
Are you kiddin' me?

129
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,583
Huh?

130
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,416
[TOBI]
Atori.

131
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,958
[ATORI]
What's the matter?

132
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,166
You know you can't sleep now.

133
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,541
The little girl... is crying.

134
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Wake up. Can't you hear me?

135
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,250
He's badly injured.

136
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,458
He's extremely weak too.

137
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,750
[MIHO]
Will he live?

138
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,166
Hey, why aren't you
doing something?

139
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,291
I thought you guys were
supposed to be from the future.

140
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,291
He's... from the future?

141
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,125
Will he be okay?

142
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,666
This is not good.

143
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,041
He has depleted too much
Reizu to regenerate himself.

144
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,250
Karasu, can you tell me
what happened to Fukuro?

145
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,916
Fukuro is...

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Huh?

147
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,416
He is dead.

148
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,916
Huh? Hahh?

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,708
Tell me, did Atori do this?

150
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,166
He didn't do this.

151
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,958
[HARUKA] It was someone,
or something else.

152
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,291
Only you have the power
to see multiple dimensions.

153
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,208
By observing each dimension,

154
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,625
they are finalized into
existence and become a reality

155
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,833
in which everyone's
lives and deaths

156
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,125
are played out to their
logical conclusion.

157
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,500
It was that masked man
who killed Fukuro

158
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,416
and hurt Karasu.

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,958
A masked man?

160
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,041
It has to be Shangri-la!

161
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,625
Tell me. He's not
going to die, is he?

162
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,166
[TOBI] At this rate, because
he's exhausted all of his Reizu,

163
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,416
he could very well die.

164
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
[AI]
Do something!

165
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
We can't just wait around
here and let him die!

166
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,583
If we could only find a way
to replenish him with Reizu,

167
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,750
there might be a
chance of saving him.

168
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,833
What's Reizu anyway?

169
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,208
And what does it do?

170
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,708
[TOBI] Reizu are the
smallest elementary particles

171
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,041
that compose all matter.

172
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,625
The are the fundamental
existence that presides over

173
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:04,416
time and space and all life and
matter, animate or inanimate,

174
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,333
but I don't think they've been
discovered in this world yet.

175
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,375
Hey, did you
catch that, Miss Yukie?

176
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,666
Oh yes, I understood
every word of it.

177
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,291
Impossible.

178
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,000
Huh?

179
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,708
[MIHO]
What are you doing?

180
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,583
This dimension has a
Reizu convergence point.

181
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,750
I am attempting to locate
the coordinates now.

182
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,250
[YU]
Hmm?

183
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,875
I've located it.

184
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,333
We just have to get
him to this point.

185
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,125
If we take him there, will we
be able to save his life?

186
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, there's a
very good chance.

187
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,875
I'll kill him,
or I'll die trying.

188
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,583
Well, that look on your face
tells me that you got nothin'.

189
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,291
Haruka happens to
be out right now.

190
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,083
However, I did get one piece
of useful information.

191
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,500
What?

192
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,541
Dr. Mayuzumi does not live
in that house any longer.

193
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,750
There wasn't a single
pair of men's shoes

194
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,208
sittin' by the front door.

195
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,416
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh, I see.

196
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,416
[YUKIE] Are you okay?
Is it too cramped?

197
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,666
It's really okay.
I'm used to it.

198
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,041
[YUKIE] Good, just try to
hang in there, uhm... Uhm...

199
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,041
Hmph. My name's Tobi.

200
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,625
[ISAMI] What? You're not
going with them?

201
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,583
[YU] Come one. It's not like we
can all fit in the car anyway.

202
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,166
I mean, who cares?

203
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,666
I can't help him.

204
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,625
Ugggh...

205
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,125
Hey!

206
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,333
Would you please just shut up
and go with them already?

207
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,333
[YU]
Isami!

208
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,625
[YUKIE]
Don't worry about a thing.

209
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,583
We'll call your cellphone
if anything happens.

210
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,666
[AI]
Okay.

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,208
Please take care of everyone.

212
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,125
[AI] Just hang in there,
Haruka. All right?

213
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,208
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?

214
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,416
Hey, did you see that?

215
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,458
Yeah, it was that girl.

216
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,083
[KARASU panting]

217
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,208
Just hang on.

218
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,833
Huh?

219
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,541
Is there something wrong?

220
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,791
We're being followed.

221
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,833
Huh?!

222
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,625
[KOORIYAMA]
I think they made us.

223
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,583
That boy's with them also.

224
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,208
You got any idea where
they might be headin' to?

225
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,708
[UCHIDA] Well, there's a quantum
potential anode up ahead.

226
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,333
Huh?

227
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,250
Man oh man, this teacher's
really haulin' some serious ass.

228
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,708
Make sure you
don't lose that car.

229
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,583
Buckle your seatbelts
and hang on everyone!

230
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,875
Oh! Miss Yukie!

231
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,666
Ha! Hahahah ha!

232
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,708
That was weird.

233
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,000
Where the hell does
she think she's goin'?

234
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,500
Get after her!

235
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,041
Okay.

236
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,583
Hang on.

237
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,583
[UCHIDA]
Kooriyama!

238
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,125
[KOORIYAMA] Don't talk!
You'll bite your tongue!

239
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,416
Ow! Dammit!

240
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,083
[UCHIDA grunts]

241
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,666
What the hell is this broad?
Some kinda rally ex-driver?

242
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,291
[KOORIYAMA]
Augh!

243
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
Why the hell are you
stoppin' right here?

244
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,375
We got a flat.

245
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,416
[UCHIDA]
What? At a time like this?

246
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,000
Come on, they're gettin' away!

247
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,500
Step on it!

00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,666

249
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,041
Oh, just calm down,
Uchida, will ya?

250
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,125
There's nothin'
we can do right now.

251
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,125
[UCHIDA]
Why not?

252
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,375
[YU] I think we
lost them, Miss Yukie!

253
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,750
Yeah, I did!

254
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,916
[TOBI] This is the place where
the Reizu is converging.

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,041
Really? A place like this?

256
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,083
You gotta hold on, Karasu.

257
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,000
We're almost there.

258
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,000
Huh?

259
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,791
Ah!

260
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,041
[YUKIE]
Blue snow?

261
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,250
Uh... What in the hell was that?

262
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,375
Well, well, well,
the gang's all here...

263
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,083
...with the Dragon Torque.

264
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,666
Hmph.

265
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,708
Even if Karasu
managed to kill Fukuro,

266
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,708
it looks like he won't
be getting away with it,

267
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,375
now will he?

268
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,208
You're wrong, Kosagi.

269
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,083
Karasu isn't the one
who killed Fukuro.

270
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,666
[KOSAGI] I'm sorry but I don't
believe the words of traitors.

271
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,416
[TOBI] We really must
stop this, Kosagi.

272
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,291
[KOSAGI]
Pleading for your life, are you?

273
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,250
How cowardly. In fact,

274
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,500
I couldn't care less about
your pathetic little lies.

275
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,375
Hand over the
Dragon Torque. Now!

276
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,583
No. I will not.

277
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,958
This dimension has
not yet reached

278
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,958
the critical point
like La'cryma has,

279
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,583
so by being in this
dimension the Torque may be

280
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,416
the key to return all worlds
to their original states.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,291
I am not going to
listen to your theories.

282
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,958
I will return to La'cryma
with the Dragon Torque.

283
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,625
[KOSAGI] That is my ultimate
mission as a Dragon Knight.

284
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,000
Ahh...

285
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
[KOSAGI gasps]

286
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,500
Atori...

287
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,208
You're hanging out with
this little group now?

288
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,750
Let's hurry. Get him
the light of life.

289
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,416
[TOBI]
Huh? Yes, you're right.

290
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,875
Everyone help me.

291
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,416
[YUKIE]
Who is that person?

292
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,333
[YU] Trust me, you're better off
not knowing, Miss Yukie.

293
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,041
Let's do this.

[ATORI panting]

295
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,333
[TOBI]
Be careful now.

296
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,291
[YUKIE] This guy's a lot
lighter than he looks.

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,791
Hyaaaaaarghh!

00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,833
I don't know who you are,

299
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,708
but I took a vow and
I won't let you pass.

300
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,916
Huh? What happened
to you, Atori?

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,125
You're not acting like yourself.

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,041
[HARUKA]
Karasu!

303
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,125
[TOBI]
It'll be okay.

304
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,041
What the...?

305
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,250
[YUKIE]
What's happening?

306
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,166
The clouds are
flowing towards us.

307
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,416
[ATORI]
I will not let you pass...

308
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,041
You are pathetic.

309
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,833
Have you forgotten how to
fight as well, Atori?

310
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,625
Please hang on.

311
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,833
Don't die, Karasu.

312
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
Geh...

313
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,708
Aw hell, what are
you doing anyway?

314
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,875
You should start practicing
what you preach, old man!

315
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,750
Stop making Haruka suffer!

316
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,000
[ATORI] What are you?
You are not human!

317
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,500
Man, you make me sick.

318
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,250
This is the end of
the Dragon Knights.

319
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,833
This is amazing.

320
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,708
I think it's working.
He's getting better.

321
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,916
What? Ahh!

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,875
[YUKIE]
Tobi, are you okay?

323
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,791
This is all my fault.

324
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,250
It's my fault for
seeing that future.

325
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,791
That is not true.

326
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,166
It's impossible to have
a future you cannot choose.

327
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,958
There's no such
thing as destiny,

328
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,208
and no way our future
is laid out for us.

329
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,333
But if... if I decide
to go away with her,

330
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,000
then Karasu will be okay.

331
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,125
You can't do that!

332
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,041
No, don't do it, Haruka!

333
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,333
What are you doing?

334
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,750
Huh?

335
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,916
Why is it that you're the one
who always pisses me off?

336
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,708
No, don't!

337
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,375
Dragon Torque!

338
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,291
Go to La'cryma and
become an illusion!

339
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
Haruka!

340
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,166
[KOSAGI]
Such an annoyance.

341
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,208
I promised...

342
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,666
I made her a promise
and I do intend to keep it.

343
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,708
For Sara.

344
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,291
[YU]
Haruka, run!

345
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,583
The Reizu, I've never
seen it like this.

346
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,250
What the hell is that?

347
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,750
[KOORIYAMA]
Have you ever seen that before?

348
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:00,333
[KARASU] Fukuro...
Are you there, my friend?

349
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:07,000
Isami, are you with Haruka now?

350
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:12,291
I'm going to stay
here a while longer.

351
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,291
Please tell her,

352
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:19,583
that I will protect her
in this dimension.

353
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:30,458
[KOSAGI panting]

354
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,833
[KUINA]
I warned you before.

355
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,250
I told you I would not allow
unauthorized activity!

356
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,958
Haruka...

357
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,750
Uh-huh.

358
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,541
[TOBI]
The future expands to inifinity,

359
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,958
and I'm postive that we're
allowed to make our own choices

360
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,250
and choose our own destiny.

361
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,416
[HARUKA chuckles]

362
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,083
[HARUKA]
Yeah, that sounds nice.

363
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,291
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

364
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,916
That summer day's dream.

365
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,375
[YU]
Haruka likes you better!

366
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,416
[HARUKA]
Are they your drawings, Mom?

367
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,791
[ASUKA] So you don't even
wanna talk to me anymore?

368
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:23,416
[HARUKA]
Next episode, "Memories."

369
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,833
Can you sense his feelings?
