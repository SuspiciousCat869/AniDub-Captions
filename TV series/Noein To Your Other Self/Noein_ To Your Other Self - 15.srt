[WOMAN]
Do you know where this is?

3
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,083
Over there? I see it.

4
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,875
Thank you for help. Bye.

5
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,166
[HARUKA]
Dad!

6
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,375
Huh? Hey! Haruka!

7
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,375
Princess, hi!

8
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,666
Uh, what's the problem, honey?

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,916
Well, I'm too old for
all that kid's stuff now.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,541
Really? Aww...

11
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,083
[HARUKA] Now, this is
a lot more grown-up.

12
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, you're all grown up.

13
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,916
Who did I see you
just talking to, Dad?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,875
What do you mean?

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,291
That woman!

16
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,208
Oh, you saw that, huh?

17
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,791
Well, I guess your old dad's
still got it, right?

18
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,708
Hmph! I don't think I like
the way she was looking at you!

19
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,791
[MAYUZUMI]
Oh yeah?

20
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,541
[HARUKA]
Yeah! This is our time together!

21
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,583
[BOTH laugh]

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,625
[MAYUZUMI] You're sure you
don't mind coming here?

23
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,625
[HARUKA]
Of course not. I like it.

24
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,083
[MAYUZUMI]
I'll be honest with you.

25
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,958
I'm kinda relieved that my
princess still likes coming

26
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,208
to amusement parks.

27
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,333
Hey, Dad! Remember that?

28
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,333
Huh?

29
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,958
Those rides over there!

30
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,375
Remember when I was
still in Tokyo, and we all

31
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,458
used to go to Grandma's
house for summer break?

32
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,166
[MAYUZUMI] That was a long time
ago. You still remember that?

33
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,041
Yeah, back when
Grandma was still alive,

34
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,666
before Mom and I
moved in the house.

35
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,041
That was a while ago.

36
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,083
[HARUKA] We all came here
together. It was so much fun.

37
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,791
[MAYUZUMI]
Hmm...

38
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,791
Are you still upset
that I went away?

39
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,458
No, not anymore.

40
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
I was just... you know.

41
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,458
Thinking about all the
fun times we had together.

42
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,708
Hey, Dad?

43
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,416
[MAYUZUMI]
Yeah, Princess?

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,625
Do you think this place
will still be here

45
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,583
when I get to be your age?

46
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,958
Huh? Sure it will.
Hey, listen, you're not still

47
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,833
seeing those ghosts
again are you?

48
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,625
Hm? Ghosts?

49
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,416
When you were little, you cried

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,750
and said you saw
ghosts all the time.

51
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh, yeah, that. Turns out
they weren't really ghosts.

52
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,791
What?!

53
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,833
[phone rings]

54
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,458
Huh?

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,583
Hmm.

56
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,958
Whaddaya want?

57
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,166
[SHINOHARA] Hey, Doc Mayuzumi!
You hidin' from me?

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,416
Where ya been?

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,750
You should really tell me

60
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,375
when you change your
cell phone number.

61
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,916
I thought I told you we
needed to have a little talk.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,708
You're with your
daughter now, aren't you?

63
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:00,000
You haven't seen her in a while,
right? Enjoy it while you can.

64
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
You never can tell when a
horrible accident can happen.

65
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,291
Twelve-year old girls get
hit by cars every day.

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,875
I mean, you're a part-time dad.

67
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,666
You can't watch over
her all the time!

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,583
[SHINOHARA chuckles]

69
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,958
[MAYUZUMI]
All right, when should we meet?

70
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,791
[MAYUZUMI]
Where?

71
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,333
[MAYUZUMI]
Alright, in two hours, then.

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
I'm sorry, honey,
but I have to go.

73
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,208
Work, huh?

74
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,041
Yeah. I have to go back
to the hotel right away.

75
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,541
[HARUKA] Heh, that's all right.
Go get all your work done!

76
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,291
[MAYUZUMI]
Huh?

77
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,666
[HARUKA]
I don't mind.

78
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,208
Because next time, I'm going
to come see you in Tokyo!

79
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,291
What? You are?

80
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,583
It's just Tokyo;
I can get there myself.

81
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,041
Then I'll let you
really spoil me.

82
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,041
[MAYUZUMI]
Hey, don't push so hard.

83
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm not that young any more.

84
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,916
[HARUKA]
Yeah, yeah. Move it!

85
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,000
[BOTH grunt]

86
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,166
[ISAMI laughs]

87
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,541
[YU laughs]

88
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,166
[AI] So what did your
dad get you this time?

89
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,833
[HARUKA] Nothing.
He got called back to work.

90
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,500
He had to take off right away.

91
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,291
What?! But your dad came
all this way to see you!

92
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,458
I know. It stinks.

93
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,708
Yeah, it does.

94
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,583
Next time you see him,
you gotta make him

95
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,708
totally spoil you rotten
to make up for this time!

96
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,750
Absolutely!

97
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:45,000
Haruka... Tobi's gone.
You know where she might be?

98
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,208
She's gone?

99
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,750
Maybe she just went for a walk.

100
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,458
[ATORI]
Karasu's gone too.

101
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,416
[MIHO]
Atori, don't look so sad.

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,625
Here, have some of these.

103
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,083
Hey, thank you so much.

104
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:10,458
Hey, you big goof ball!
You put them in your mouth!

105
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,750
I think Miho... really has
a big crush on Atori.

106
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,958
[TOBI] I'm afraid I'm
getting a negative reading.

107
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,958
A dimensional strain is
germinating from this point.

108
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,333
[TOBI]
Karasu?

109
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
What is it, Tobi?

110
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,791
Is there anything bothering you?

111
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,666
No.

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,416
Do you remember
when we were kids?

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,541
When we just believed that time
moved from past to future.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,791
[TOBI]
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,500
We really didn't know
any better back then.

116
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,458
[KARASU] But the concept of
time isn't just a measurement

117
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,875
created by man.

118
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,833
We learned that it's
really a fluctuating value

119
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,458
which is linked with space.

120
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,666
That is correct.

121
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,541
[KARASU] When mankind figured
out that time and space

122
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,125
were always changing
without stability,

123
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,416
perhaps we lost sight of
the meaning of existence.

124
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,375
Maybe we are all... illusions.

125
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,458
Myself, Haruka...

126
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,041
This dimension... La'cryma...

127
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,708
You're wrong about that.

128
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,666
Huh?

129
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,250
We both know that our existence

130
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,583
is actually established
by observation.

131
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
You're the one who found Haruka,

132
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,291
and that is why
she truly exists.

133
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,458
And then, Haruka found
you here as well...

134
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,250
And that is why you truly exist.

135
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,833
[KOORIYAMA]
Is there a reason

136
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,541
we're driving around
this mountain?

137
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,958
I'm tryin' to attach a numerical
value to the quantum potential.

138
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,125
And do you think that'll finally
help to persuade those guys?

139
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,625
I don't think it'll work
with the committee... But...

140
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,083
I'm sure someone like
Dr. Mayuzumi will understand.

141
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:03,083
[KOORIYAMA] Do we have any
idea where this guy is yet?

142
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,708
No, but I'm sure he'll
visit Haruka sometime soon.

143
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,750
Huh?

144
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,125
What's wrong?

145
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,375
It's them.

146
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,041
[UCHIDA] Huh? What do
you think you're doin'?

147
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,583
Just stay in the car, okay?

148
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,958
Hey, I'm not stayin' in here!

149
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,958
[KOORIYAMA]
Hey, you!

150
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,541
[KARASU] Huh?
[TOBI] Huh?

151
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,083
[KOORIYAMA] You mind tellin' me
what you're doin' over there?

152
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,708
[TOBI]
Karasu!

153
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:36,041
Y'see, I'm a cop, and I'd like
to ask ya a few questions.

154
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,708
[UCHIDA]
Kooriyama!

155
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,500
Come on now, buddy, I know ya
understand what I'm sayin',

156
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,750
don'tcha? Get over here, now!

157
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,291
Hmph!

158
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,958
[KOORIYAMA] I told ya
to get your ass over here!

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,666
Hold it there!

160
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,375
[UCHIDA gasps]

161
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,208
I see, some kind
of magician, are ya?!

162
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,583
Huh?

163
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,333
[KOORIYAMA]
Why you wearing a heavy cape

164
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,333
when it's this
frickin' hot, huh?!

165
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,458
Who in the hell are you anyway?

166
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,666
It doesn't matter. You wouldn't
understand the answer.

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,000
Just turn around and walk away.

168
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,750
[KOORIYAMA] I don't think so,
pal. You're gonna start talkin',

169
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,666
and you're gonna
tell me what I wanna hear

170
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,250
and I better like the answers!

171
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
Now, who the hell are you

172
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,625
and what the hell
are you doin' here?

173
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,250
In ten years...

174
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,250
Huh?!

175
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,166
When ten years have
passed in this dimension,

176
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,958
you might be able to
comprehend my existence.

177
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,875
I think I've heard enough.

178
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,000
How 'bout you and I have
a nice, long conversation...

179
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,333
...in a rubber room
somewhere, huh?!

180
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,916
Just wait a minute!

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,083
Tell me, are you a
transported existence

182
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,458
from a time-space
several years ahead?

183
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,291
Where the solution of relativity
between quantum mechanicals

184
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,875
and space-time has
been identified?!

185
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,958
[TOBI] I'm not sure
Karasu understands that.

186
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,375
But you're definitely
on the right track.

187
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,333
You're pretty smart, lady.

188
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,833
You might actually comprehend

189
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,750
how we've come to
exist in your world.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,750
Who the hell are you?
Are you with him?

191
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,666
[YU]
Hey, Isami?

192
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,875
[ISAMI]
Yeah?

193
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,083
[YU]
Can I ask you something?

194
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,500
[ISAMI]
Sure.

195
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,291
It's about Haruka.

196
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,500
I think she's got these
strange powers or something.

197
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,250
Where'd that come from?

198
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,583
Nah, she doesn't. You're
startin' to sound like Miho.

199
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,458
[YU]
I know... But why does Karasu

200
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,458
keep tellin' me to protect her?

201
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,791
We are men, after all.
It's our job to keep women safe.

202
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,375
Yeah... Uh...

203
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,625
Do you, you know, like anyone?

204
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,583
Huh? Yeah, of course I do!

205
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,625
I wouldn't be a stud if
I didn't like the ladies!

206
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,750
So, anyone in particular?

207
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,666
[ISAMI]
Yeah, but you can't tell anyone.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,208
What?! Ms. Yukie?!

209
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,250
[ISAMI] Shut up, you idiot!
You're impossible!

210
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,500
Keep your voice down!

211
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,125
Everyone knows.
It's not a secret.

212
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,958
Wha--?! Impossible!
How'd they know that?!

213
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,750
Just forget it. I'm sorry
I even asked you about it.

214
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,666
What is that supposed
to mean?! I really like her!

215
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,333
Yeah, yeah...

216
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,708
What's this? Some more magic?

217
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,333
This area is
definitely suspicious.

218
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,250
[UCHIDA] Is there a
quantum potential here?

219
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,875
[TOBI]
Most likely.

220
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,916
It's coming from in there.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,875
I'm getting a reading
from that area.

222
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,333
Let's go.

223
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,833
Hey, where are you going?

224
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,125
Let's go!

225
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,958
Hey, wait!

226
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,833
Oh, boy...

227
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,333
[AI] What?! No,
I've sprung a leak again!

228
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,166
And I'm all out of wrenches!

229
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,375
[MIHO giggles]

230
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,250
Aw, crap! Yeah, take that!

231
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,791
Don't think so!

232
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,000
It'll take more than that trick
to disrupt my water supply!

233
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,708
Aw, no, she got my pipe again!

234
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,666
[HARUKA]
You're good at this, Miho!

235
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,958
[MIHO]
Nobody can defeat me!

236
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,916
[AI]
It's a trap!

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,708
[HARUKA]
Ai, you're terrible.

238
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,333
[AI groans]

239
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,375
[ATORI gasps]

240
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,541
[MIHO]
Huh? Hey, what's the matter?

241
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,541
[HARUKA]
Huh?

242
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,666
[AI]
Ah?

243
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,875
[ATORI]
It's them.

244
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,916
[MIHO]
Who?

245
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,833
[UCHIDA] I have a confirmed
reading over here.

246
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,833
But, it isn't a very strong one.

247
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,791
That's it, alright. It's making
a small critical reaction.

248
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,000
[KOORIYAMA]
Hey, what's over there?

249
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,916
[TOBI]
Karasu, come here.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,791
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?!

251
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,875
[KARASU]
Is this it?

252
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,125
[TOBI]
There's an irregular fluctuation

253
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,125
germinating from in there.

254
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,500
What do you see?

255
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,750
Straight ahead.

256
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,166
Yeah.

257
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,833
What? I can't see anything.

258
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,666
Only we can.

259
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,583
It's at the
critical stage, all right!

260
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,125
At the critical stage?!

261
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,791
What's that?!

262
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,083
[KARASU gasps]

263
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,375
Where the hell
did that come from?

264
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,708
It must be the
dimensional contact point.

265
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,875
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?

266
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,666
Uroboros...

267
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,500
An Uroboros...

268
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,041
Hey, what're you doin'?!
Be careful!

269
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,458
No, don't do that!

270
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,625
It passed right through!

271
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
Tobi, is this...?

272
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,416
You are looking at an
undefined existence.

273
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,916
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

274
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,166
It's an overlapped state.
It's a quantum existence only.

275
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,666
Perfect! More techno-babble
that I don't understand!

276
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,291
Let me see now...

277
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
So even when I see it,
it doesn't really exist?!

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,250
Or am I just going insane?
Well, how about it?!

279
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,708
[MIHO]
Bye!

280
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,708
[HARUKA] Atori, thanks
for walking them home.

281
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,958
--[ATORI] I'll see you.
--[AI] See ya!

282
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,708
[MIHO]
See you tomorrow!

283
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,083
[HARUKA]
Huh?

284
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,500
[MIHO]
What're you doing, Haruka?

285
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,416
Uh, wha--?

286
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,041
It's your turn, put a card down!

287
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,083
[HARUKA]
Huh?

288
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,791
[AI]
She's totally spacing out again!

289
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,916
[KARASU grunts]

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,291
[KOORIYAMA]
Hey, what's wrong?

291
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,291
[UCHIDA]
Tobi?

292
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,916
This oscillation...
It's Shangri-la!

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,250
[UCHIDA]
What's Shangri-la?

294
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,041
[KARASU] It's him!
The mask of Shangri-la!

295
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,583
The mask...?

296
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,250
Oh no, Haruka! She's in danger!

297
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,083
[KARASU yells]

298
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,083
[AI] Aww, there's no more
water works cards.

299
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,750
Haruka, you gotta stop her!

300
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
Huh? What's that?

301
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,750
[MIHO] Give it up! My victory
is still guaranteed!

302
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,166
[HARUKA gasps]

303
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,625
[HARUKA]
What's happening?!

304
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,375
Get out!

305
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,166

Huh...?

307
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,416
Huh?

308
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,833
Come here, Haruka.

309

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,416
Just get behind me!

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041

312

Come here, right now.

313
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,083
Don't be afraid.

314
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,500
No way.

315
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,916
You aren't Karasu.

00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,375
[KARASU gasps]

321
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:23,583
[MASK] Haruka, come with
me to Shangri-la!

322
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,791
[KARASU]
Be careful!

323
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,750
Haruka, here!

324
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,791
Huh? What is it, dude?

325
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,916
Haruka!

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,625
Huh?

327
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,500
She's been... kidnapped!

328
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:59,583
[voices echoing]

329
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,833
[HARUKA]
Huh?

330
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,208
What's this?

331
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,916
[MASK] This place is called
the dimensional ravine.

332
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,666
Watch yourself!
Here, get behind me, Haruka!

333
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,833
I'm scared...

334
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,041
Just stay close!

335
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,000
[MASK]
Haruka.

336
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,750
Come here.

337
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,166
Come to me.

338
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,416
The masked man.

339
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,833
[NOEIN] I am Noein.
The one who understands

340
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,166
all there is to know.

341
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Now, come with me!

342
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,666
Come with me to Shangri-la!

343
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,708
Shangri-la?!

344
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,541
[NOEIN]
Yes, the ideal dimension.

345
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,375
I will not go with you!

346
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,166
[HARUKA gasps]

347
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,708
[HARUKA]
Karasu?

348
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,375
[HARUKA]
What is this place?

349
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,375
[NOEIN]
This is Shangri-la.

350
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,291
There is no war
or suffering here.

351
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,416
It is a world veiled in silence.

352
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,875
This world is one of perfection.

353
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,375
Right now, all worlds
are trying to merge

354
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,458
with this ideal dimension.

355
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,833
[HARUKA]
Merge?

356
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,375
[NOEIN]
That is correct, Haruka.

357
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,458
Dimensions where you exist.

358
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,083
Even dimensions
where you don't exist.

359
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,958
All the different worlds
were branching off

360
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,125
into a disorderly mess.

361
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,708
Into chaos.

362
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:56,625
With infinite dimensions came
equally infinite disasters.

363
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:03,166
[NOEIN] And that is why I forced
the dimensions to conjoin...

364
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,500
...into La'cryma and Shangri-la.

365
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,583
[NOEIN]
Which of them will you choose?

366
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,666
It's my choice?

367
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,375
I have to choose?

368
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,000
[HARUKA gasps]

369
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,625
[KARASU]
Haruka!

370
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,833
Give me your hand!

371
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,000
Karasu! Here!

372
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,958
[KARASU]
Stay back!

373
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,333
[HARUKA]
Karasu!

374
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,958
[KARASU growls]

375
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,916
[NOEIN]
You fool!

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,666
[KARASU]
Be gone!

377
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,916
[KARASU gasps]

378
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,416
[HARUKA screams]

379
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,000
[KARASU]
Haruka...!

380
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,541
Why, Haruka? Why?!

381
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,291
Karasu...

382
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,625
[NOEIN]
You can forget about him.

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,083
[NOEIN] He is merely
an illusion to you.

384
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,875
No! He is not an illusion!

385
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,166
My protector is right here.

386
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,166
[NOEIN]
What is this?!

387
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,833
[NOEIN gasps]

388
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,125
[HARUKA]
You killed Fukuro, didn't you?

389
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,750
I will never believe you!

390
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,791
[NOEIN]
The Uroboros!

391
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,500
[ISAMI] Come on, dude,
what's the rush anyway?

392
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,500
What's up, man?

393
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,666
Karasu...

394
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,750
Where is she?

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,625
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

396
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,958
That summer day's dream.

397
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,041
[YU] Where is she?!
What happened to Haruka?!

398
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:14,500
[HARUKA] I get the feeling
it's slightly different.

399
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,083
[NOEIN laughs]

400
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,875
[NOEIN]
Do you want to know?

401
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,250
[HARUKA]
Next episode, "Repeat."

402
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,791
Will I be able
to meet you again?
