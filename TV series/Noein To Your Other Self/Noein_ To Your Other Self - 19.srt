Grandma...

[BARON whines]

4
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,541
[HARUKA] You were in
the video too, huh, Baron?

5
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,208
This was 4 years ago, you know.

6
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,625
[HARUKA] Grandma was
doing fine back then.

7
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,416
I guess I shouldn't
expect anything

8
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,916
[BARON whines]

9
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,958
I promise, Haruka,
I'll write you all the time.

10
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,541
I'm sure she forgot about that.

11
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,666
[BARON barks]

12
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,333
Huh?

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,250
[KOORIYAMA]
Hey.

14
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
[UCHIDA]
Good mornin', Haruka.

15
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,958
Oh, hi Miss Uchida and
Mr. Kooriyama. How are you?

16
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,375
[KOORIYAMA] So, were you
expecting a letter or something?

17
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh, no, not really.

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,958
I just remembered something
from the good ol' days.

19
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
That's kinda funny, you know?

20
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,458
Your good ol' days
are my recent ones.

21
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,541
[HARUKA]
Huh?

22
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,791
This'll make more sense
down the road,

23
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,166
but once you get older,

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
you forget more stuff
than you remember.

25
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,458
Do you forget stuff,
Mr. Kooriyama?

26
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,541
[KOORIYAMA]
Hm?

27
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,000
Have you ever
forgotten about somebody

28
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,750
who was important to you?!

29
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,125
Well, I don't know
if I've done that.

30
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,958
[KOORIYAMA]
I've had a long life so far

31
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,291
and I've met lots of people,

32
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,666
so I'm sure I've forgotten
someone along the way.

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,833
[HARUKA]
I won't forget.

34
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:33,750
[KOORIYAMA]
Hm?

35
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,750
I know I won't forget you.

36
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,666
No matter how old I am.

37
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,708
Well, thank you
very much, little lady.

38
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,125
[phone rings]

39
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,208
Hey, Ai, what's goin' on?

40
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,458
That's great! Is everyone
going to be there?

41
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,666
Yeah? Yeah. Oh, really?

42
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,250
[KOORIYAMA]
See you later.

43
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,333
Ah, hang on a sec.

44
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,833
Um... Did you guys
come here for a reason?

45
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,583
Nah, we just wanted to come
by and see how you were doin'.

46
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,541
Isn't that right, Uchida?

47
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,583
Right. I did have one question.

48
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,791
Has anythin' unusual
happened lately?

49
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,375
Depends on what you
mean by unusual.

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,375
It's all so weird, I've actually
kinda gotten used to it.

51
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,291
That's really incredible,
because I keep thinkin'

52
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,458
I'm gonna have a heart
attack any second now.

53
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,458
[HARUKA giggles]

54
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,958
Haruka, if you're
ever in danger,

55
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,833
or need our help, please
don't hesitate to call us.

56
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,125
Would you do that?

57
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,583
Thanks so much, you two.

58
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,958
[KOORIYAMA]
Take care.

59
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,208
[HARUKA]
Oh, hello? Sorry.

60
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, I got it.
Around 10 o'clock?

61
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,791
[KOORIYAMA]
She seems to be doin' okay.

62
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,750
[UCHIDA] Despite all the bizarre
things that are happenin'.

63
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,333
Kids are pretty resilient.

64
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,416
They seem to be able to
adapt better than adults

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,083
most of the time.

66
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,375
There somethin' on
your mind, Uchida?

67
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,708
That thing yesterday...

68
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,541
Officially it's bein' called
a weather phenomenon.

69
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,375
[KOORIYAMA] Big surprise,
they're calling it a mirage.

70
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,625
[UCHIDA] And that doesn't
upset you at all?

71
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,625
[KOORIYAMA]
Sounds like something

72
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,333
an arrogant adult
would think of.

73
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,166
[UCHIDA]
Yes, but...

74
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,708
Yeah, well,
even if we're killed,

75
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,708
we can just ignore
it if we have to.

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,250
[UCHIDA]
What did you say?

77
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
[KOORIYAMA] Oh, it's nothing.
I just remembered something

78
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,750
after talking to the girl.

79
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,750
So, what do you wanna do now?

80
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,583
I'll go and speak directly
with Professor Sasaki.

81
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:33,250
And ask him to stop the
Magic Circle Project?

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,833
You know what, Uchida?
I've been thinking...

83
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,666
Remember when we were
kids and we relied

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,875
on our senses and instincts?

85
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,166
Well, then we grew up and we
learned how society functions,

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,166
and we started to make
decisions using our smarts.

87
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,208
I don't know which is better...

88
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,541
[ISAMI] That thing yesterday
was definitely impossible,

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,250
but I'm totally positive
that it was real.

90
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,958
Of course it was real. We all
saw it with our own eyes.

91
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,416
[ISAMI] Yeah, but it doesn't
show up in any of the pictures.

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,083
It was quite obviously
a gigantic ghost!

93
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,041
Yeah, yeah...

94
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,125
D'you think everyone
forgot about it?

95
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,666
How could they?

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,125
I don't know, but it's like
no one talks about it anymore.

97
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,541
It's like anyone
who's older than us

98
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,916
just hates talking about
something weird going on.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,833
Yeah, but I know that's
something we definitely saw.

100
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,958
So the next time it shows up,
I'll take it with this.

101
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,083
And then they'll know...

102
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,791
[ISAMI]
Dude...

103
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,583
Hey, who wants to go
get some ice cream?

104
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,291
I'm in! Hey, c'mon, let's go!

105
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,791
Wow, lately, he's really
been in a good mood.

106
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,416
I think we all know why.

107
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,041
You brought that for a reason?

108
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,250
I'll record it
next time for sure.

109
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,708
How can a video camera
make a guy that glad?

110
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,375
This from someone who gets
excited over a soccer ball?

111
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,708
This flower is really pretty.

112
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,291
[ATORI grunts]

113
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,250
What was that for?!
The flower didn't deserve that!

114
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,250
I was aiming for your head,
so why did I hit the flower?!

115
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,666
I just don't know...

116
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,666
Sure ya don't!

117
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,250
Talk! I know you're
up to something!

118
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,125
I don't know what you
could be talking about...

119
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,833
Don't play dumb! Talk!

120
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,208
[ATORI]
Stop! Please...

121
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,416
[TOBI]
Stop it, Kosagi!

122
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,416
Let go! He was able
to avoid my attack!

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,291
He regained his abilities!

124
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,250
Then why isn't he
dodging you now?!

125
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,375
If Atori was sane, he would've
fought back already!

126
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:09,250
[ATORI groaning]

127
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,000
[TOBI]
You okay, Atori?

128
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:15,041
[ATORI]
It hurts! It hurts...

129
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:22,083
[ATORI cackles]

130
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,958
[UCHIDA]
Do you really intend to approve

131
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,791
the Magic Circle Project?

132
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,375
This is wrong, Professor Sasaki!

133
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,458
[SASAKI] Uchida,
you haven't changed a bit

134
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,375
since you were a student.

135
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,333
You always jumped
to conclusions.

136
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,708
Science is never
about conclusions.

137
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,541
[UCHIDA]
I know it's about the process!

138
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,291
You drilled that into me
all through university!

139
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,791
You also told me that science
is the asset of all mankind.

140
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,458
That it wasn't to be
used for profiteerin'!

141
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,041
[SASAKI] True, Uchida.
But from the moment we realized

142
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,250
that science can be lucrative,

143
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,541
economics starts to make
its influence felt.

144
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,166
[UCHIDA]
But, Professor...!

145
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,375
[SASAKI] I'll talk with
Shinohara one more time.

146
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,041
Well, thank you.

147
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,291
Don't get the
wrong idea, Uchida.

148
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,250
This doesn't necessarily mean
that I believe your description.

149
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,416
The critical outbreak of the
overlapping of dimensions

150
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,166
as described in your report
is difficult to assimilate.

151
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,125
I merely want to watch over
the extent of your research

152
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,875
a little longer.

153
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,583
[UCHIDA]
I understand, Professor.

154
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,541
[SHINOHARA] Shut down the
Magic Circle Project? Sasaki!

155
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
I think you're insane!

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,708
We've detected an abnormality
in the quantum potential.

157
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,208
As a member of the Absolute
Critical Prevention

158
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,291
Planning Committee, I cannot
approve Magic Circle Project's

159
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,041
marine experiment
under those conditions.

160
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,083
[SHINOHARA]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,625
[SASAKI]
There are safety issues!

162
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,333
I don't think you understand
the big picture, Professor.

163
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,375
Y'see, Ab-Com is
merely an adornment.

164
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,750
The Government's excuse
so that they can claim

165
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,666
that they're thinkin'
of the people's safety

166
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,666
and the environment.

167
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,833
Perhaps you should consider
who you should thank

168
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,375
for being able to spend time

169
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,375
in such an...
extravagant laboratory.

170
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,250
Yes, but--

171
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,458
We're using this project
to pry open the door

172
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,916
of quantum mechanics!

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,708
It will result in
a new revolution

174
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,166
of computer networking!

175
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,500
It won't just be communications,
the entire world

176
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,041
will be changed.

177
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,958
It's time for a transformation.
We will create a new world!

178
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,875
Who the hell are you to
tell me to call it off, huh?!

179
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,583
I didn't say you
should call it off.

180
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,083
All I'm asking you to do

181
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,333
is momentarily
reconsider the project.

182
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,291
Hah. Sounds just a
little weak to me.

183
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,208
If we stop this now,

184
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,875
you won't get any further
funding for your labs.

185
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,166
So I'm gonna forget you
told me to reconsider

186
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,666
and let's go full-force on this.

187
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,375
The Mayuzumi approach to quantum
mechanics will be proven.

188
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,333
I refuse to go along.

189
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,083
There is no way I can
approve an experiment

190
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,416
that is as dangerous as this is!

191
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,416
[AI]
Going to the pool might be fun.

192
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,083
[MIHO]
But it'd be lame if we have

193
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,958
to wear our school swimsuits.

194
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,958
[ISAMI] I get sick
from swallowing the water.

195
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,583
Yeah, 'cause you're
a lousy swimmer.

196
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,750
[ISAMI] Yeah, so what?
There's no need to force myself

197
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,833
to go in the water.

198
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
I can live just
fine on dry land.

199
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,333
[AI]
Excuses, excuses...

200
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,250
[MIHO]
How pathetic.

201
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,500
[ISAMI]
What'd you just say?!

202
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,166
[AI]
Chill out, Isami.

203
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,958
Hey, is something wrong, Haruka?

204
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,458
[HARUKA]
Huh? Is that Aya...?

205
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,875
[HARUKA]
Huh!

206
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,875
[YU] What are you doing?!
Where are you going?!

207
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,500
[HARUKA] Aya, is that you?
You are Aya, right?

208
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,375
[AYA'S MOM]
Oh my, it's little Haruka!

209
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,416
It's been such a
long time, how are you?

210
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,750
Fine, thanks. It's nice to see
you! Are you here on vacation?

211
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,125
[AYA'S MOM] Yes, sightseeing
over summer break!

212
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,166
That sounds like fun!

213
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,500
Just like old times!
You were inseparable!

214
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,375
Aya, do you remember
how lonely you were

215
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,666
when Haruka moved
out of the city?

216
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,583
Uhh... yeah...

217
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,166
Haruka, will you please
start writing to Aya again?

218
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,208
[HARUKA]
Sure!

219
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,916
Um, Mom? I don't remember her...

220
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,000
[HARUKA gasps]

221
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,875
[AYA]
Are you really moving away?

222
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,333
[HARUKA]
Yeah..

223
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,458
[AYA] I'm gonna write you
letters all the time, okay?

224
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,291
[HARUKA]
Really?!

225
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,500
Of course, I swear it!

226
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,708
Is that someone you knew
back when you lived in Tokyo?

227
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,625
[HARUKA]
Yeah, it's Aya.

228
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,375
She's totally
forgotten about me!

229
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,125
Hey, Haruka, don't let it get to
ya! You've got us now, right?!

230
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,666
[HARUKA]
It's not like that...

231
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,333
It doesn't really
bother me that much.

232
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,875
I was just a little
surprised, that's all.

233
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,500
Who cares about her anyway?!

234
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,333
Our friendship is eternal!
It will never end!

235
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,458
Yeah, well, you'd be
the first one to forget.

236
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,458
That's so rude, Isami!
How dare you?!

237
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,500
[HARUKA]
Oh, I forgot! I gotta go!

238
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,541
My mom asked me
to pick up a few things.

239
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,541
[AI]
What?

240
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,916
[HARUKA]
I'm sorry, see you later!

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
[AI]
Haruka!

242
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,458
This isn't good...

243
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,375
What do you mean?

244
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,750
She took off!

245
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
You heard her, she has
to get stuff for her mom.

246
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,125
You're such a moron.
Can't you see she's totally

247
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,291
lying about that?!

248
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,666
[ISAMI]
What?! Really?

249
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,750
[AI] Obviously, she's pretty
bummed out about Aya.

250
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,666
I should go see if she's okay.

251
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,416
Good idea. Knowing her,
she'd get even more depressed

252
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,583
if we all went to cheer her up.

253
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,916
[KUINA] I will perform a
fixed-reverse calculation!

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,250
[ALL gasp]

255
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,458
What did you just say?!

256
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,750
Was that a...
reverse calculation?!

257
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,166
[KUINA]
Correct. We have Dragon Torque's

258
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,750
quantum composition
data on file.

259
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,958
If I recompose the Reizu
according to its data,

260
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,083
I can bring the
Dragon Torque to La'cryma.

261
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,500
[TAIZA]
Out of the question!

262
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,458
To perform a fixed-reverse
calculation would require

263
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,041
the full processing power
of La'cryma's Reizu simulator!

264
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,000
The lines would be
temporarily lost!

265
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,375
What if Shangri-la were to
attack at that moment, huh?!

266
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,208
We would be defenseless!

267
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,000
[KUINA] Then is there
a better solution?!

268
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,291
[KUINA] Commencing now.
Is that acceptable?

269
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,375
[AI]
Hello, anyone home?

270
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,875
What? Oh.

271
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,583
Haruka's out right now.

272
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,833
Would it be okay if
we waited for her?

273
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,041
Yes, of course. Why don't you
wait in her room upstairs.

274
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,625
[ISAMI]
Yes ma'am.

275
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,916
Oh, there's snacks and juice in
the kitchen, so help yourselves.

276

[phone rings]

277

[KOORIYAMA]
This is Kooriyama.

278
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,541
[KOORIYAMA] I've just been
pulled off this assignment.

279
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,750
They just ordered
me to get back.

280
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,666
Looks like I'm not
gonna be able to be

281
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,708
your bodyguard anymore.

282
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,041
[UCHIDA]
What d'you mean?!

283
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,958
Well, Chairman Sazaki of
Ab-Com has just resigned.

284
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,458
And his replacement,
some geezer named Toby,

285
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,208
is gonna remove
you from Ab-Com.

286
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,375
Oh no...

287
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm afraid it's just
the usual dirty method.

288
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,291
[AIDA] I think Marukai's
just moved to platform three.

289
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,916
Hold on...

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,666
This is 6 to 3, do you copy?

291
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,833
You got 'im yet.

292
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,041
3 to 6, I just got him
in my sight. Hm.

293
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,125
[KOORIYAMA]
6 to 3, roger. Don't rush it.

294
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,291
[TEENAGER]
Hey, Mr. Detective.

295
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,500
[TEENAGER]
Heh, I just wanted to know.

296
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,333
Did you enjoy the almond jelly?

297
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,833
What the hell'd you do?!

298
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:14,500
[TEENAGER cackling]

299
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,583
[MAN]
Somebody fell on the tracks!

300
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,833
Aida!

301
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,375
[KOORIYAMA]
Aida, where are you?!

302
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,791
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?

303
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,583
Aida, hang on!

304
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,666
[KOORIYAMA] They covered up
the murder of my colleague

305
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,666
by calling it an
impulsive suicide.

306
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,041
[UCHIDA] Didn't the police
investigate it properly?

307
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,833
[KOORIYAMA]
The case was a spy incident

308
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,666
going up as high as
a resident ambassador.

309
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,541
We couldn't make it
public knowledge.

310
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,541
That's really awful...

311
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,500
Wait, where are you goin' now?

312
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,333
[KOORIYAMA] Even if we
leak this to the media,

313
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,833
Shinohara will just
cover it up. He always does.

314
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,083
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

315
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,333
[KOORIYAMA] Well, I'm not
gonna give up this time.

316
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,500
Even if it kills me.

317
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,333
Let's go, Uchida.

318
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,375
I think the only thing
we can do right now

319
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,208
is to find Dr. Mayuzumi. Coming?

320
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,625
Uh-huh.

321
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,541
[HARUKA]
I was starting to forget...

322
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,291
...about my grandmother...

323
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,375
I don't understand,
because I loved her so much.

324
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll gradually forget
her smile... her voice...

325
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,208
...each and every
day that passes.

326
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,083
[HARUKA]
Wow, that's cute!

327
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,500
Thanks, Grandma!

328
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,500
[YU] Your grandmother
died two years ago, right?

329
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,166
It's hard to keep remembering
people who have passed away.

330
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,333
It's something you can't help.

331
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,083
[HARUKA] Eventually,
everyone forgets each other.

332
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,625
Just the way Aya
forgot all about me...

333
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,750
And how I forgot
about Grandma...

334
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,791
But there are some things
you'll never forget!

335
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,708
Yeah?

336
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,791
Of course. I mean,
I still remember

337
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,916
how you and I first met
like it was yesterday.

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,083
It was summer break
in 2nd grade.

339
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,041
You came to my house
with Baron and your mom.

340
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,083
[YU]
You totally forgot.

341
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,291
How could you not remember that?

342
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,208
I mean, it wasn't
even that long ago.

343
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,791
[HARUKA]
I didn't forget.

344
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,583
[HARUKA]
I totally remember.

345
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,000
I remember because
I was so nervous.

346
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,708
We had just moved here.

347
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,250
And I was so happy when
you were nice to me.

348
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,541
[YU] Hey, let's head back.
I told everybody

349
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,916
to head over to your house

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,750
and that we'd meet up
with them there later.

351
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,250
[HARUKA]
Okay.

352
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,458
I might be wrong,

353
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,250
but I think you used to
hold my hand back then.

354
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,583
Wow, you remember
the weirdest details.

355
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,125
[OPERATOR] Undulation function
approaching three values.

356
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,708
[OPERATOR]
Commence data transport.

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,083
[KUINA] Commence dimension
transport countdown.

358
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,625
[KUINA]
I'm ready... Dragon Torque.

359
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,125
[HARUKA]
Oh, you're all here.

360
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,083
This stuff's really amazing.
Check it out!

361
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,250
You're right, it is,
just don't get in the way.

362
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,458
I'm not a child.

363
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,416
Hey, Tobi, what's this
thing over here do?

364
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,166
[TOBI]
Wait, Isami. Don't touch it.

365
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,541
Knock it off.

366
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,875
Atori, would you like to
visit the mountain sometime?

367
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,875
I think I would.
That sounds like fun.

368
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,291
Where's Karasu?

369
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,000
He went to go check out an area

370
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,833
with a high rate of
dimensional change.

371
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,708
[ATORI gasps]

372
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,625
Atori, what's wrong?

373
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,458
What is it?

374
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,458
[ATORI]
This is bad! Very bad! Listen!

375
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,750
The wind has started
howling again!

376
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,083
Tobi.

377
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,416
I need an explanation.

378
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,708
Tell me quickly!

379
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,708
[OPERATOR] Fixed-reverse
calculation rate 72%.

380
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,458
Stop this!

381
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,791
[AI]
Is that blue snow?!

382
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,708
Impossible!

383
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,125
Reversed calculation?!

384
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,500
What the heck is that?

385
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,916
It has to be Kuina!

386
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,666
He must be trying to transport
Haruka back to La'cryma!

387
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,458
This dimension is wavering!

388
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,458
[KOSAGI]
Karasu, this undulation!

389
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,041
I've never felt this
kind of pressure!

390
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,916
Is it... La'cryma?

391
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,333
Haruka...!

392
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,333
Karasu?!

393
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,833
Look at that!

394
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:47,500
[ASUKA humming]

395
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,875
Haruka!

396
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,291
Stay back! You'll get pulled
in if you get too close!

397
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,500
Yu!

398
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,458
Haruka!

399
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,250
Karasu!

400
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,875
[HARUKA]
Oh no!

401
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,208
[KARASU]
Haruka!

402
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:24,250
[ATORI laughing]

403
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,500
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

404
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,250
That summer day's dream.

405
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,791
It's supposed to be
15 years into the future.

406
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,166
[KOSAGI]
But it's not necessary for me.

407
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,875
[KUINA]
Then come with me to Shangri-la!

408
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:23,250
[HARUKA]
Next Episode: "Once More."

409
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,625
Will I see you again?
