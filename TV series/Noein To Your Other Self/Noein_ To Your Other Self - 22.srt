1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,125
[AI]
No way!

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,125
W-Why have all the houses
around us disappeared?

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,541
[ISAMI]
Impossible! Am I dreaming?!

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,750
[AI]
No, no, it's no dream.

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,000
That hurt!

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,333
[MIHO]
It's aliens!

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,916
[ISAMI, AI]
Huh?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,166
Our alien friends have finally
invited us to their home planet!

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,166
Huh?! What if
there's no oxygen?!

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,791
What if they're from Venus?
They could be little gray men.

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,625
It sure looks like we've
been teleported somewhere...

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,208
I say we go outside!

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,416
[ATORI]
I wouldn't.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,708
Why not?

15
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,833
Your assumption's correct.

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,833
Our surroundings are different.

17
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,833
We've all been transported
along with the house.

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,166
So then, you know where we are?

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,208
[ATORI]
Yes... It's Shangri-la.

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,083
[AI]
Shangri-la?

21
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,416
Ai! Miho! Isami!

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,916
[NOEIN] I bet that
deep down, you actually do

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,833
desire this happy world,
this Shangri-la.

24
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,791
That's why you invited
your friends here, isn't it?

25
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,541
You're wrong! I wanna go back!

26
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,333
I... I want to go back
to my dimension.

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,250
[NOEIN]
So... Then why not return them

28
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,958
to their original world?

29
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,583
Please, guys, go back
to your own world!

30
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,166
[NOEIN]
It won't change now.

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,916
Because you already
wished for it.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,916
Because you saw
them in this world,

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,083
they are now established
to exist in this world.

34
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,833
Hang in there... Haruka...

35
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,916
I'll get you out of this!

36
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,916
[NOEIN] Aren't you glad?
They will be freed

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,958
from an unhappy future

38
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:54,833
with their arrival in this
dimension. This Shangri-la.

39
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,166
It won't be just them.

40
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,916
We shall save every future
in every dimension.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,125
You have the ability
to do it, Haruka.

42
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,000
How can you tell that
the future is unhappy?

43
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,125
[NOEIN] I have seen the
futures of every dimension.

44
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,708
[NOEIN] Very well. I shall show
you their future as well.

45
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,083
[ATORI] Don't do it. You don't
know what could happen.

46
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,625
But we have to find Haruka.

47
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,750
And out friend Yu, too!

48
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,333
Do whatever you want then.

49
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,041
[MIHO]
Okay, we will do what we want.

50
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
[ATORI]
Miho! You're going with them?

51
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,708
Will you come with us, Atori?

52
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,375
Do I have any other choice?

53
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,875
You ready?

54
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,500
[MIYUKI] Their parents died
five years ago, didn't they?

55
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,750
[ASUKA]
Yes, they did.

56
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,875
The children were raised
by their grandmother.

57
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,750
[MIYUKI] Oh, those poor kids.
What are they gonna do now?

58
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,291
[ASUKA] I heard they'll be
taken in by distant relatives.

59
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,875
[MIYUKI] I'm told Isami will
be taken in by a friend

60
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,500
of his deceased father.

61
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,583
[ASUKA]
It's a shame that brothers

62
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,666
have to be split up like that.

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,000
Isami...

64
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,791
[NOEIN] Ah... the chain
of unhappiness has begun.

65
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,416
[HARUKA]
What do you mean?!

66
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,041
[NOEIN]
This is only the beginning

67
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,500
of their unhappy future.

68
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,666
[GIRL A] Did you see
the new guy? He's cute.

69
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,958
[GIRL B]
Dreamy!

70
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,000
[NOEIN]
Poor thing.

71
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,875
She doesn't seem
to have any friends.

72
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,583
Who, Miho?

73
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,291
[NOEIN]
And as for the others...

74
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,083
[GIRL C]
Hey, Ai. Ai!

75
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,291
[AI]
Hmm?

76
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,083
[GIRL C] Is it true?
What I heard was that

77
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,750
you made the
all-star soccer team!

78
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
[AI]
Yeah, I did.

79
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,291
[GIRL D] Wow! That's incredible!
Give 'em your best!

80
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,541
[AI]
Thanks!

81
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,416
[GIRL C] I know I'll be
watching every game!

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,416
[GIRL D] Make sure you
score a lot of goals!

83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,958
Thanks a lot, I'll do my best!

84
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,708
[GIRL D] Go get 'em!
[GIRL C] For sure!

85
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,791
[AI]
Huh?

86
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,458
[AI]
Isami...

87
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,083
Oh, disgusting.
It's those punks from North.

88
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,833
You should tell your friend
not to hang out with those guys.

89
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,250
They get into a lot of fights.

90
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,666
[GIRL C]
You know him?

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, we were classmates
back in elementary...

92
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,875
[PUNK A]
Get him!

93
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,750
[PUNK B]
Isami, get it already!

94
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,208
[ISAMI]
Haha, let's go!

95
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,500
[NOEIN]
What do you think?

96
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,458
Do you still consider
this a "happy future?"

97
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,125
Isami...

98
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,125
[ASUKA]
Miyuki! Miyuki!

99
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,625
[MIYUKI]
Coming! Hold on a second.

100
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,916
It's gone! It's gone!
I don't know where it went!

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,583
Hold it! What are you
talking about, Asuka?

102
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,416
[ASUKA]
Just come with me!

103
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,541
[MIYUKI]
What's wrong?!

104
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,875
What is it?!

105
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,375
[ASUKA]
Look! It's gone!

106
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,625
[MIYUKI]
Gone?! What's gone?

107
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,166
Can't you see?!
My house is gone!

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,375
What do you mean?
How can your house go away?

109
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,875
That's what I'd like to know!

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,083
Oh, what's going on?!
Somebody explain it to me!

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,041
No! Haruka was in the house!

112
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,458
She was in the house!

113
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,916
What do I do? Wha--Aaah!

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
Just calm down, Asuka!

115
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:34,833
[ASUKA panting]

116
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:39,333
[ASUKA sobs]

117
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,291
Oh, Yu...

118
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,000
[YU groans]

119
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,250
[KARASU]
What now?

120
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
It looked farther
away awhile ago,

121
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,125
so I think we must
be getting closer.

122
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,583
[KARASU]
Huh?

123
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,583
You know, the mountain there
that looks like a castle.

124
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,958
[KARASU]
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,625
It's still a long way off.

126
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,000
What the heck are you
looking at, Karasu?

127
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,625
It's right over there,
can't you see it?

128
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,666
So to you, it doesn't look
that far away from here.

129
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,500
You mean you can't see that?

130
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,250
I understand. Maybe it's because
this space-time is de-coherent.

131
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,833
[YU]
What?

132
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,833
[KARASU] It's the same as when
you split into two in La'cryma.

133
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,958
This place is also indistinct

134
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,916
without an
established existence.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,916
So everything around
me is an illusion?

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,541
[KARASU]
Not really.

137
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,208
Your strong desire
to save Haruka

138
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,916
has established this
indistinct space.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,500
Then if I... were to think
about where she could be...

140
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,583
The path will begin
to show itself.

141
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,916
[KARASU]
Get down!

142
00:08:53,083 --> 00:09:03,666
[MIHO sobbing]

143
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,125
[PUNK A]
Hey, that's a bit harsh, Isami.

144
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,791
We're workin'
hard too, ya know.

145
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,041
[PUNK B]
Yeah, lighten up, man.

146
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,166
[ISAMI]
Whatever. You guys suck.

147
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,541
[PUNK A]
Come on, man.

148
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,208
[PUNK B]
Isami, just listen to me.

149
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,000
The thing is, my girl said--

150
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,000
[AI]
Isami?

151
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,125
[ISAMI]
Huh?

152
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,291
How's it goin'?

153
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,458
It's been awhile...

154
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,500
[ISAMI]
Yeah, I guess.

155
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,958
Hey, this chick
a friend of yours?

156
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,125
[ISAMI]
So, what's goin' on?

157
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,541
[AI] Nothing, really.
I'm just on my way home

from afterschool practice.

00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,333
Oh. I guess you're still doin'
all that soccer horsecrap?

160
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,791
[AI]
Yeah. And what are you doing?

161
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,250
Now that's none
of your business.

162
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,625
Do you even have a clue
what you're doing?!

163
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,458
You know, this tough act
doesn't really suit you!

164
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,875
[ISAMI]
Psh. Don't lecture me.

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,500
Why don't you just
get out of my life?

166
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,416
No, I won't!

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,416
Get the hell outta here!

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,458
[AI]
Ah...

169
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,083
You never really
got it, did you?!

170
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,875
Just leave me alone!

171
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,666
[ISAMI]
Go away!

172
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,875
[PUNK C]
Hey there. I hear you guys

173
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,458
haven't been on your
best behavior lately.

174
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,458
So then. Let's talk,
come to an agreement.

175
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,750
[ISAMI]
Get up!

176
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,625
[PUNK A] Where do you
think you're going?!

177
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,958
[PUNK A] Take a good
look at your opponent

178
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,583
before you pick a fight!

179
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,708
[ISAMI]
Alright!

180
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,958
Let's get outta here.

181
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,875
[PUNK B]
What are you talkin' about?

182
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,000
We got a reputation, man!
We gotta finish it!

183
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,958
Really?

184
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,916
You really wanna pull
a knife on me?

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,375
You want a piece of me, huh?!

186
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,375
Go ahead, do it!

187
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,166
What is this, all for show?!

188
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,500
I ain't scared of you, man!

189
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,333
You want me to kick your ass a
little more, is that it?! Huh?!

190
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,541
No problem! I can do that! Easy!

191
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,083
Knock it off.

192
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,125
That's fine by me! Let's go,
you bastard! Let's get it on!

193
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,083
[ISAMI]
I said knock it off!

194
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,375
[ISAMI]
Shit...

195
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,625
[PUNK C]
Let's get outta here!

196
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
[PUNK D]
This is bad...

197
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,250
Real bad!

198
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,500
[HARUKA]
Isami...

199
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:10,541
[NOEIN] The poor thing... He's
been abandoned by his "friends."

200
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,541
Impossible...

201
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,458
[UCHIDA] There are 5
laboratory ships in all.

202
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,375
This mountain is where they
will be aligned in a circle

203
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,041
and launch elementary particles.

204
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,916
The 5 ships will be used
to accelerate the particles,

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,041
forcing the quantum potential
to bend along the circle.

206
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,416
They will launch three
particles: Alpha, Beta, Gamma.

207
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
The particles will be
accelerated in the Magic Circle

208
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,083
until they achieve light speed.

209
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
When every particle
is at the speed of light,

210
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,291
the dimension is
at the critical point

211
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,416
which will produce
the Theta particles.

212
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
I see. There are
a few differences

213
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,666
from our history, but not many.

214
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,791
[UCHIDA]
In what way?

215
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,083
[TOBI]
I think perhaps your history

216
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,208
is happening five years faster.

217
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,541
Do you think that's due
to violation of causation

218
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,458
rather than our world being just
bein' an approximate dimension?

219
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,833
[TOBI]
Probably.

220
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,750
Uh, excuse me.
I think that's enough

221
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,166
of the complicated crap, okay?

222
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,791
Besides, all we really need to
do is destroy this thing, right?

223
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,791
[SHINOHARA]
A 1985 Romanée-Conte.

224
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,791
It's flavor is described
as "mystifying."

225
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,791
It's known as the greatest
beverage created by man.

226
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,958
How about it, Mayuzumi?

227
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,583
Wouldn't you agree
it's a suitable wine

228
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,750
for this historic event?

229
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:35,291
Shinohara. I'll ask once again.
Stop the experiment.

230
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,416
[SHINOHARA] Come on, now,
Doctor. Don't get so worked-up.

231
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,083
Thanks to you
finding this place,

232
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,958
the Magic Circle looks
like it'll work.

233
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,625
[UCHIDA]
Thank you.

You alright?

235
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,291
[UCHIDA]
You okay there?

[KOORIYAMA]
I'm not so thrilled about

237
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,125
floatin' around in the air.

238
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:56,416
But now that my feet are back on
solid ground, I guess I'm okay.

239
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,708
Listen to me--

240
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,250
[SHINOHARA]
It's fine! It's a path mankind

241
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
is bound to take someday anyway.

242
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,375
Drink up.

243
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,666
Hey, if I don't do it,
someone else will.

244
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,958
[SHINOHARA]
The thing about mankind is,

245
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,875
we always wanna get ahead.

246
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,291
We're not happy
with the status quo.

247
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,125
We remember the
guys who got ahead

248
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,083
with admiration and jealousy.

249
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,708
And now, as long as mankind
exists in the Universe,

250
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,958
I will be remembered
as a forward-thinker

251
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,375
who created a new era.

252
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,708
Um, wow!

like it's farther away now.

It's your fear.

The fear that you
have inside you

256
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,750
keeps pushing

It's me?

To save her, don't run away.
Show strength. Face up to it.

[AI]
Um, Doctor?

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,708
I have a soccer game
a few days from now.

00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,875
[DOCTOR] I'm saying that
you have to give up soccer.

I'm sorry. Who are you?

[THERAPIST] Clearly, it's a
depersonalization disorder.

290
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,708
I suspect that it stems from
her desire to deny reality

00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,958
due to extreme stress.

[NOEIN]
I told you.

The future contains
nothing but unhappiness.

296
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,583
But you wanted to see the
so-called "possibilities"

that the future had to offer.

00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,125
[ISAMI]
Yu?

316
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,833
Stop it, you're not like this.

317
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,750
What are you doin' here, man?

318
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,333
When did you get
back from Tokyo?

319
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,708
Listen to me, Isami. Find Ai.

320
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,041
You are the only one who
can save her life now.

321
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,583
[ISAMI]
Me?

322
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,125
Of course.
Who else is gonna do it?

323
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,333
Listen--!

324
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,875
[ATORI]
Miho.

325
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,750
I've been looking for you.

326
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,291
So this is where
you wandered off to.

327
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,791
[MIHO]
Who... Who are you?

328
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,458
[ATORI] Let's go home.
Back to where your friends are.

329
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,500
[MIHO]
No...

330
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,583
This is not the place
you belong. You know that.

331
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,791
[ISAMI]
Ai!

332
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,750
[AI]
Isami?

333
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291
What are you standing
over there for?

334
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,250
It's dangerous!
Come over here!

335
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,833
[AI]
What did you come here for?

336
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,625
Did you come here to
laugh at me? Is that it?

337
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,291
Because I won't be able
to play soccer anymore?

338
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,750
Hell, I can barely walk...

339
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,333
[ISAMI]
You idiot! What's one leg?!

340
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,291
Look at me! I lost an eye!

341
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,125
It doesn't matter, I'm done...

342
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,958
[ISAMI]
No! You're not done!

343
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,916
[ISAMI] Even if you don't have
your legs, if you wanna run,

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,416
I'll run with you on my back!

345
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,125
We can play soccer that way!

346
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,416
[ISAMI]
So please...

347
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,875
Please don't do this, okay?

348
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,791
[ISAMI]
Come here.

349
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,416
Oh, Isami...

350
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,500
[ATORI]
They're all waiting.

351
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,208
They are?

352
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,333
[ATORI]
You are not alone.

353
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,166
[MIHO]
I'm not?

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,458
[ATORI]
Come on, let's go.

355
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,666
It's okay. Everyone's safe now.

356
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,791
That's good.

357
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go.

358
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,291
This time, I'll find Haruka.

359
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,041
I swear it.

360
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,125
Isami, we--

361
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,750
Yes, Ai?

362
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,541
I was having a dream.

363
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,208
Me too.

364
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,375
Atori?

365
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,583
[ATORI]
It was no dream.

366
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,000
That was just one of
many future dimensions

367
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,250
that were consumed
by Shangri-la.

368
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,458
[MIHO] Wait a minute,
that was out future?

369
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,166
[ATORI]
One possible future.

370
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,083
[HARUKA]
They're back! They're all back!

371
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,666
The future's not set in stone!

372
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,041
Even if we encounter
unhappiness in the future,

373
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,541
we will never give up!

374
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:49,583
[NOEIN cackling]

375
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,791
[NOEIN] But one of you
couldn't endure the misfortune.

376
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,166
Do you know who it was?

377
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,583
It was your friend, Yu.

378
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,791
His future self.

379
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:04,583
And you already
realized that, didn't you?

380
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,958
[NOEIN]
I am the Yu of this dimension.

381
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,583
[NOEIN]
Haruka... My dear...

382
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:22,416
You left me behind
when you died...

383
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,166
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

384
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,875
That summer day's dream.

385
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:07,375
[NOEIN] All dimensions
will unite and disappear.

386
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,208
[KARASU] Yu, do not fear.
Think only of Haruka.

387
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,666
[YU] I don't understand it,
but I have to save Haruka!

388
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,416
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "The End."

389
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,875
Is everyone going to disappear?
