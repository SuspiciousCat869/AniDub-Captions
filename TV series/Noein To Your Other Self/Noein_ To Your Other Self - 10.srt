1
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,958
[UCHIDA] I wonder if
Haruka is really back.

2
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,416
[KOORIYAMA] Didn't you get
a call from her teacher?

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,708
You know, I really don't think

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,416
she would go out of
her way to lie to us.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,125
Hmm?

6
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,375
[KOORIYAMA]
Hey, Uchida.

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,625
[UCHIDA]
What?

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,041
[ISAMI] It's no big deal.
So he's with her.

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,000
What are they doin'
over there anyway?

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,583
All I care is that
Haruka's there.

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,208
Those two seem chummy.

12
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,958
It looks like she's
come back, doesn't it?

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,291
Yes, thank goodness.

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,375
[phone beeping]

15
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,583
This is Uchida.

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,958
Huh?

17
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,875
Yes. I understand.

18
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,083
[KOORIYAMA]
What's wrong?

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,583
I have been ordered to show up

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,416
at today's regular
status meeting.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,291
[KOORIYAMA] What? You gotta
go to Tokyo right now?

22
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,708
[UCHIDA]
Mhmm.

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,833
[laughing]

24
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,583
[ASUKA] S-So like I said,
he had a crush on you.

25
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,833
[MIYUKI] What, you're wrong.
He said he liked you.

26
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,500
Remember, he poured his heart
out to you that night?

27
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,833
[ASUKA]
I don't remember that.

28
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,166
[MIYUKI] It's true.
I can't believe you forgot.

29
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,458
[ASUKA]
I should have kissed him.

30
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,000
[MIYUKI]
Yeah!

31
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,083
[laughing]

32
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,250
[MIHO]
Haruka! Are you there, Haruka?

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
[HARUKA]
Come on up!

34
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,041
[MIHO]
Hello?

35
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,208
[ALL]
Huh?

36
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,500
[MIYUKI]
Hello!

37
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,083
Look at the cute
visitors we have!

38
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,000
[ALL]
Huh?!

39
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,833
Oh crap! The witch.

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,041
Asuka, come greet our guests.

41
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,583
[ASUKA]
Okay...

42
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh, look. The gang's all here.

43
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,125
If you want some snacks,
they're in the usual place.

44
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,666
Thank you for
looking after my son.

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,875
Uh! It's our pleasure.

46
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,541
You should all come over
and play sometime.

47
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,250
Whenever you come
over everything's

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,500
so cheery, I just love it!

49
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,916
All right...

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,750
I'll do that...

51
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,458
[ASUKA]
Miyuki, get back here!

52
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,833
We should, hic, celebrate!

53
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,708
Okay! See you!

54
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,333
Asuka! Do you have any beer?

55
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,875
What's up with Mrs. Goto?

56
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,000
She's drunk...

57
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,833
Aliens!

58
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,833
[ISAMI] Hey, dude.
What's up with your mother?

59
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,666
She's just had a few
drinks this morning.

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,250
It's okay. She's
having a good time.

61
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,125
No kidding. She's toasted.

62
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,833
No one cares about that.

63
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,000
What in the world
have you gotten

64
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,208
yourself mixed up in Haruka?

65
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,083
Ah... I-It's okay, Ai.

66
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,125
Oh, really?

67
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,583
Really, I mean it.

68
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,125
[AI]
You're stressin' me out.

69
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,041
Where did you go?

70
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,541
Uhm... Nowhere.

71
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,666
[AI]
I don't believe you.

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,875
You're hiding things
from me again.

73
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,708
Hey, where were you
this whole time anyway?

74
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,166
Uh, nowhere.
Well, not nowhere really.

75
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,750
I was in this room all day.

76
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,166
That sure is weird,
because when we got here...

77
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,250
...I could swear I saw someone
by the other window upstairs.

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,583
So, who was that?

79
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,625
Uh... You're imagining things.

80
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,208
This is the only
room being used

81
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,541
here on the second floor.

82
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,791
It's being used as
a storage room, right?

83
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,541
That's right.

84
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,375
Then, do you suppose
that it was a ghost?

85
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,958
[HARUKA, AI]
Huh?!

86
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,583
Stop it! We don't need to tell
ghost stories right now.

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,916
Haven't we had enough of that?

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,791
Hey, Haruka, has anything
been moving by itself?

89
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,250
Is anything floating?

90
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,375
You've got ghosts
on the brain, Miho.

91
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,916
I will perform an exorcism.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,833
Luckily, I'm prepared,

93
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,875
because I carry one
of these wherever I go.

94
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,583
That's so not right.
Hey, just cut it out.

95
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,791
Evil spirits, begone!

96
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,750
Evil spirits, begone!

97
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,416
Hey, this could get ugly.

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,541
What now?

99
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,208
What do you mean, "get ugly"?

100
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,375
You're hiding something
from me Haruka.

101
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,916
But, I can't really
talk about it.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,375
No buts, start
talkin', girlfriend.

103
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,041
Okay, but, I don't think
you're gonna believe me.

104
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,583
What are you
talking about, Haruka?

105
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,458
Don't you know I always
believe everything

106
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,041
my best friend tells me?

107
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,250
What? So it really is a ghost?

108
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,791
Shut up.

109
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,041
[AI] Do you really
expect me to believe that?!

110
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,750
[HARUKA] I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

111
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,125
I'm not a moron, you know.

112
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,583
I'm not gonna
believe you're hiding

113
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,166
some dude from the future.

114
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,625
[ISAMI] Yeah, that's more
impoosible than ghosts.

115
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,416
[MIHO] People from the future
are just illusions.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
[AI]
So, future boy is really here?

117
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,541
[HARUKA]
Yes.

118
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,791
[AI]
I still can't believe you let

119
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,291
a guy like that into your house.

120
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,875
It's really okay.

121
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,666
Looks like I'll have to expose
this guy for who he really is.

122
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,750
[HARUKA]
Ai! Wait, Ai.

123
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,291
[door creaks]

124
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,416
[AI]
This is the room, right?

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,208
[HARUKA]
Uh, hold on a second.

126
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,458
[AI]
Huh? What's with this guy?

127
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,416
He's wearing a black coat
in the middle of summer?

128
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,083
Hey, mister...

129
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, that guy in the black cape
really is a ghost, you know.

130
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,291
You told them?

131
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,791
[HARUKA]
Uh, sorry.

132
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,208
You might have fooled Haruka,

133
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,583
but you're not
gonna fool me, pal!

134
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, tell us the truth!

135
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,458
Why are you here
bothering Haruka?

136
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,666
What are you after?

137
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,291
[AI]
He disappeared.

138
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,458
[ISAMI]
No way! That's impossible!

139
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:09,791
[chattering]
Oooooo... Whoa!

140
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:15,916
[MIHO shrieks]

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,583
Ahh!

142
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,541
That's impossible!

143
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,833
What do you think you're doing?

144
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,791
That's cool!

145
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,833
[BARON whines]

146
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,666
[AI] If you're really
from the future,

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,291
tell us what's happening
15 years from now!

148
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,375
Come on, bub. We're waiting!

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,708
He can't talk about
stuff like that.

150
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,500
It would interfere
with past events.

151
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,833
Oh, I see.

152
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,458
You're going with the old
time warp thing, right?

153
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,250
Did you know about this guy?

154
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,333
Kinda.

155
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,208
Why'd you keep it
a secret from me?

156
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,041
I never would've told anybody.

157
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,458
I do know how to keep
a secret, you know.

158
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,500
I think that's impossible.

159
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,291
That's not funny.

160
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,166
[YU]
Cut it out, Isami!

161
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,375
[ISAMI]
You take that back!

162
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,958
Hey, you two.
Stop screwin' around!

163
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,750
I give up! Give up! Isami!

164
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,416
[ISAMI] You're not
getting off that easy!

165
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,375
So, what about your son?

166
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,333
He's upstairs playing
with everyone.

167
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,791
I'll go home by myself.

168
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,875
Please, would you
look after him?

169
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,250
I think they're old enough
to look after themselves.

170
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,916
That's true.

171
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,375
[ASUKA]
See you later, Miyuki!

172
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,625
[MIYUKI] Ne-Next time we
do this at my house, Asuka.

173
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,291
[ASUKA]
You got a deal.

174
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:47,333
[friendly chatter]

175
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:52,375
[friendly chatter]

176
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,000
[ATORI] I'm beginning
to enjoy this dimension.

177
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,791
[TOBI]
You've started to stabilize.

178
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,083
We're beginning to adjust.

179
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,958
Tobi, how long can we exist
in the dimension anyway?

180
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,333
I don't know.

181
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,750
[ATORI]
Well, I feel good right now.

182
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,416
There's no sense in
thinking about the future.

183
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,708
[ATORI chuckles]

184
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,666
[TOBI]
Then what should we do?

185
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,458
It's obvious

186
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,166
We'll destroy the Dragon Torque.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,041
Unfortunately, she's way
too powerful right now.

188
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,750
I don't feel like
being thrown again

189
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,458
into the dimensional ravine.

190
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,583
[TOBI]
What do you suggest?

191
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,375
We'll have to use
that wimpy child

192
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,750
who's always with her.

193
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,625
[TOBI]
Oh...

194
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,541
[AI] Well, I guess
we should get going.

195
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,125
[ISAMI]
Yeah, right.

196
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,875
[AI] You shouldn't stay over at
Isami's house too long though.

197
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,125
It really looks like
it's gonna rain.

198
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,958
[YU]
I'm just gonna borrow a book.

199
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,291
Bye!

200
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,291
--[AI] See you guys later.
--[YU] See you later.

201
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,750
[ISAMI]
Take it easy!

202
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,083
[ISAMI] I still think
it's weird. Don't you?

203
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,125
[YU]
Huh?

204
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,958
I mean, that dude's
from the future,

205
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,583
and now we're hiding
this strange guy

206
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,166
that's wearing a long cape
in the middle of summer.

207
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,250
You know, any normal person
wouldn't believe this stuff.

208
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,166
I know.

209
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,958
See what I mean?

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,291
[ISAMI] Anyone else
would think we're crazy.

211
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:27,125
[BOTH laughing]

212
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,250
[ISAMI]
At least your mom has

213
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,250
finally stopped
buggin' you so much.

214
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,500
[YU]
Sorta.

215
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,875
[ISAMI] Is she making
you go to a good school?

216
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,916
I think that's
my problem anyway.

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,708
Hmmm... Mhm.

218
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,458
[ATORI chuckles]
There he is.

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,291
There's something
familiar about that kid.

220
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,083
[TOBI]
You might be right about that.

221
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,666
That kid is Karasu.

222
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,708
[ATORI] Yes, isn't that a fun
little twist of fate for him?

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,375
Imagine being able to meet
your past face-to-face.

224
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,041
[TOBI]
Hmm...

225
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:10,250
[ATORI cackles]

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,625
[ATORI]
Oh, boys!

227
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,791
How ya doin', kids?

228
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,791
Oh, no!

229
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,541
You rememebr me?

230
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,000
[ISAMI]
What's the deal with this guy?

231
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,166
[YU]
Isami, be very careful.

232
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,500
[ATORI]
I have no business with him.

233
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's have a little talk.

234
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,250
[YU]
Why should I talk to you?

235
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,750
[ATORI] That familiar look
in your eyes pisses me off.

236
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,250
Perhaps I should come
over and gouge them out

237
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,916
and put you out of my misery.

238
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,333
[TOBI]
Stop it, Atori!

239
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,041
Tobi, what the hell
are you doing?

240
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
Run, get out of here!

241
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,166
We gotta split!

242
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,041
[TOBI]
Go!

243
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,208
You foolish little girl.

244
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,458
You can't interfere
with the dimension

245
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,333
any more than you already have.

246
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,125
Time-space is irreversible,

247
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,208
but it's impossible to predict
how the effects will show ah--

248
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,541
[ATORI]
Don't you lecture me!

249
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,958
[gasping]
A... tori...

250
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:22,125
If you get in my way again,
you are dead.

251
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,625
[ATORI cackles]

252
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,875
[YU]
Hurry!

253
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,208
[ISAMI]
Come on, Yu.

254
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,125
[ATORI chuckles]

00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,166
Get outta there!

--[YU] Come on!
--[ISAMI] Help me!

260
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,708
That's it!

261
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,541
I had heard that you two
were childhood friends.

262
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,291
Huh?

263
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,583
[ATORI]
This is perfect!

264
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
Let go!

265
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,833
[YU] Stop it! Stop it!
Let go of him!

266
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,625
You're killing him!

267
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,541
Run for it! Go on!

268
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,166
[ATORI]
It's time to die!

269
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
Augh!

270
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:02,958
Huh?

271
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,166
Eh?

272
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,916
Hm... Uh?!

273
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,708
Fukuro...

274
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,666
He got away. Hmph.

275
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,041
[FUKURO]
Are you kids okay?

276
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,458
Uh, yeah...

277
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,375
Who are you anyway?

278
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,333
[FUKURO]
Just a guy.

279
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,041
Hmph. Good thing for you
boys I got here in time.

280
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,208
Don't stay out too late, okay?

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,041
Who was that guy anyway?

282
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,375
I don't know,
but he saved our lives.

283
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,291
But, why?

284
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,916
I have no idea. I don't know...

285
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,375
Why do we have to split up?

286
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,583
[KUINA] I decided
to send Fukuro in first

287
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,750
with a mission to secure the
Dragon Torque's location.

288
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,625
Once it's location
is identified,

289
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,250
we'll go in together.

290
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Karasu is bound to show up.

291
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,041
We will let Fukuro
deal with Karasu.

292
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,500
You and I will concentrate
on the Dragon Torque.

293
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,208
[UCHIDA] The irregular
electromagnetic wave confrimed

294
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,541
that the pre-arranged
experimentation site

295
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,625
is predicted to be from
a quantum resonance.

296
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
You've all received the data.

297
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,458
As you can see,

298
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,875
it also appears on the
map of quantum potential

299
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,458
I manufactured using the
observation data from the site.

300
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,875
Since this event,
there is a possibility

301
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,416
of a particular placment site
being triggered in that region.

302
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,916
It is my personal opinion that
expanding the investigation area

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,541
of the pre-arranged
experimentation site

304
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,916
and taking investigative
measures capable

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,791
of comprehensive judgement
concerning the abnormality

306
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,583
of the placement site is
the one and only way to avoid

307
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,916
the damges that may occur
at the time of the experiment.

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,083
That is all.

309
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,833
I have to wonder if the use

310
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,875
of the word damages is
inappropriate, Dr. Uchida.

311
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,041
It certainly is.

312
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,583
It is my duty as
a member of the Abso--

313
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,500
[SHINOHARA]
A moment Mr. Chairman!

314
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
Yes, Mr Shinohara?

315
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,416
Is the government
actually serious about

316
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,083
putting a quantum transporter

317
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,458
into practical
application at this time?

318
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,500
It's not a good idea.

319
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,458
Please explain yourself,
Mr. Shinohara.

320
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,250
[SHINOHARA]
I will. Again, the entire world

321
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,875
is currently developing
the technology to send

322
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,208
large quantites of
data instantaneously.

323
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,708
We're up against
the entire planet.

324
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,666
For all that, don't you think
that waiting for a survey

325
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,666
of the effects on surrounding
regions that may

326
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,958
or may not occur is an
inefficient use of our time?

327
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,041
I understand what
you are saying, but--

328
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,250
[SHINOHARA]
But nothing.

329
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,416
There will always be
an element of risk.

330
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,083
That's why we choose a site
that's located far away

331
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,958
from Tokyo to do the experiment.

332
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,833
[UCHIDA] Hmph.
[SHINOHARA] Isn't that right?

333
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,625
[SHINOHARA] And don't get
all bureaucratic on me

334
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,458
just because it's a joint
military-civillian project.

335
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,500
My concern is for the
safety of the region!

336
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,875
Don't act like you care,
you gun-for-hire!

337
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,625
Uh?!

338
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,916
[SHINOHARA] I'll do the
investigation on my own.

339
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,750
We've got plenty of specialists

340
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,958
in quantum physics
on our payroll.

341
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,416
They're a dime a dozen.

342
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,458
[KOORIYAMA]
Just shut the hell up, junior.

343
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,833
[SHINOHARA] Sorry, grandpa,
did you say something?

344
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,708
[CHAIRMAN]
Silence!

345
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
[METEOROLOGIST] The effects
of a lower pressure system in

346
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,666
the Sea of Okhotsk has
caused a storm warning

347
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,833
in the lower city area.

348
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,625
That thunder sounds
really close.

349
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,375
I hope lightning doesn't
strike our house.

350
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,916
Wait, Karasu.

351
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,833
Atori is going after
the Dragon Torque.

352
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,333
I have to stop him.

353
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,125
He's trying to destory
the Dragon Torque,

354
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,916
along with this entire house.

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,583
To interfere with the Dragon
Torque in a negative way,

356
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,708
runs the risk of activating
its enormous power.

357
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,125
If that should happen,

358
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,583
the destabilization of this
world would accelerate,

359
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,791
which could lead to the
obliteration of all dimensions.

360
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,416
You have to stop him.

361
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,083
[ASUKA] Hey, Haruka. Didn't you
get a call from Yu earlier?

362
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,166
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

363
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,500
[ASUKA]
Are you kids going on a date?

364
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,791
Give me a break, Mom.

365
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,666
[ASUKA]
You're not? Too bad.

366
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,041
[YU]
Haruka, be careful.

367
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,416
The guys in the black
capes are after us again.

368
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,791
[HARUKA]
They are?

369
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,791
Yeah, the same guy that
attacked us on the ropeway,

370
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,375
and there was
another one, too.

371
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,041
Another one?

372
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,291
He's here.

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,958
Karasu, I didn't think you
had the guts to fight me.

374
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,583
[ATORI] I can take care of
the Dragon Torque later.

375
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,625
I'll take care of you now.

376
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,708
I wish I could stop this.

377
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:57,625
[ATORI cackles]

378
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,000
This weather's just lovely.

379
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,666
Wouldn't you agree?

380
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,541
[ATORI grunts]

381
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,750
Now die!

382
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,375
Damn you!

383
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,208
[ATORI]
Die!!

384
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,750
Hey, Mom?

385
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,000
[HARUKA]
Mom?

386
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:58,041
Hey. Seems like time is frozen.

387
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,625
[HARUKA]
Karasu? Karasu... Where are you?

388
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,208
[ATORI]
Die already!

389
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,875
[KOSAGI gasps] Kuina,
time is now standing still.

390
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,916
[KUINA groans]

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
[KOSAGI]
Kuina!

392
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,916
You must find Fukuro, Kosagi.

393
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,541
This dimension is wavering
more than we calculated.

394
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,708
Use caution.

395
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,083
[KOSAGI gasps]
Don't talk anymore.

396
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,750
[KUINA] We must secure
the Dragon Torque.

397
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,625
It's there again.

398
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,000
[VOICE]
Dragon Torque...

399
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,708
Huh?

400
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,416
I know I heard something.

401
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,833
[VOICE]
Dragon Torque...

402
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,208
Huh?

403
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,708
You, are the Dragon Torque.

404
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,291
I know you.

405
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,750
No, you don't.
I am here for you.

406
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,916
You will come with me.

407
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,083
Hah?

408
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,083
[HARUKA]
Isami?

409
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,875
You're the future Isami.

410
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,541
But that's...
that's impossible!

411
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
This... is an illusion.

412
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,416
Dammit.

413
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,416
Now I'm really mad.

414
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,041
You will die!!

415
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,500
Hmm?

416
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,291
He's gone?!

417
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,875
Noooo!

418
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,625
Where is he?

419
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:17,583
Not yet. No way. He won't win.

420
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,208
You're Isami, aren't you?

421
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,833
Stay back. Stay there!

422
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,083
Isami, it's me.

423
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,083
Karasu!

424
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,458
[FUKURO]
Stand down, Karasu.

425
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,291
I won't let you have her.

426
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:38,000
[ASUKA]
Haruka? Haruka!

427
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,541
Don't do this.

428
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,583
I have sworn to protect her

429
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:46,041
until the day my body disappears
from all dimensions.

430
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,541
Karasu, don't go!

431
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,958
You can't fight him!

432
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,458
Don't do it, please!
You're friends.

433
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,500
Huh?

434
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,583
It all started when
you showed up.

435
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,791
You alone are the reason

436
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,541
everything is
happening this way.

437
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,125
Who... are you?

438
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,791
All of this is your fault!

439
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,666
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

440
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,166
That summer day's dream.

441
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,333
[KOORIYAMA]
You seriously believe

442
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,875
in alternate worlds, Uchida?

443
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,666
[AI]
Who are you?

444
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:19,541
[ISAMI] We're still friends
no matter how far apart we are.

445
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,541
[HARUKA]
Next, "Out of Sync."

446
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,166
Is there anything I can do?
