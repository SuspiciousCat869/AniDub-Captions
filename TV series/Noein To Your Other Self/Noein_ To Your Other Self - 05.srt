Tobi, begin the process.

2
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,875
[TOBI]
Okay, but we have to hurry.

3
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,958
Coordinates set.
Begin countdown.

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,416
[TOBI]
Done. Atori, we're ready to go.

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,250
So be it. Now we say
goodbye to La'cryma.

6
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,208
I guess this is farewell...

7
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,875
You're right. So true.

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,625
[HARUKA] Baron! Watch the
house while I'm gone, okay?

10
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,500
[HARUKA]
I'm seeing things...

11
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,958
[HARUKA]
Hi!

12
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,000
[MIHO]
You're late!

13
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,416
[MIHO'S MOM]
Come in, come in!

14
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,375
Haruka, Ai, what's wrong?

15
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,041
Mrs. Mukai, what's with
the glasses?!

16
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,500
Aren't they great?
These are the Aura Glasses

17
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,416
I ordered a few days ago!

18
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,041
I see a red aura around Ai, Mom!

19
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you certain? I'm pretty sure

20
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,625
I'm seeing a blue
light around her.

21
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,041
[AI]
You're imagining things.

22
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,833
It's definitely there,
you just have to concentrate.

23
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,208
[MIHO &amp; MIHO'S MOM]
Show us!

24
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,916
Well, that certainly proves it.
This family's nuts.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,333
Hey, Mom, Haruka has been
telling us some really

26
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,083
mysterious things have been
happening around her recently,

27
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,208
so I'm determined to find out
the actual cause of her visions.

28
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,666
Let me think how...

29
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,083
Ah, you should probably
use the Prophecy Board

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,291
I bought the other day!

31
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,750
Oh! Great idea!

32
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,166
Maybe we should leave...

33
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,750
Impossible. She's doing
this for my benefit.

34
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,250
I want nothing to do with
the UFO summoning ceremony.

35

[BARON whines]

36
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,583
[MIHO]
This is a Prophecy Board.

37
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,541
We ask it whatever
questions we have,

38
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,250
and the spirits give us answers!

39
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,166
Oh...

40
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,333
It's come down to this, has it?

41
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,416
Haruka, put your
hand right here.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,166
Um, sure.

43
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,916
[MIHO]
Now, gather all your senses

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,958
and focus them on your
questions, then wish

45
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,125
ever-so gently so as not to
startle the spirits of the dead

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,791
who inhabit the Ouija board.

47
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,583

[MIHO]
Hey, Ai!

00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,416
Since you're here, you have
to do the chant with us!

54

What?! I have to do it, too?!

55

Yes, we do it all together now.

[HARUKA]
Another N!

00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,125
"Noein"... I guess?

69
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,625
[MIHO]
Yeah, but what does it mean?

70
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,625
Beats me.

71
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,250
Me, too. It makes
no sense at all.

72
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,208
Yeah, you're right.

73
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,166
I guess we can
forget about me now.

74
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,458
Since that's over, why don't
we ask the Ouija board

75
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,791
Something more interesting?

76
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,833

Let's ask it when
Miho's gonna get hitched!

What?! No!

[MIHO giggling]

81
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,625
No, no! You can't ask that! It's
too embarrassing! Please, don't!

82
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,583
Aren't we supposed to use
it to tell our fortunes?

83
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,250
Yes, but marriage of all
things... We can't do that.

84
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,875

00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,083
Are you hot or something?

It is kinda warm.

ascertained the coordinates

of Atori and the others?

No, apparently not yet.

[KUINA]
What are the observers doing?

91

[FUKURO]
You can't blame them.

92
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,208
Ever since one of the
investigators was killed,

93
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,583
they've become desperate.

94

They've tarnished our good name.

[FUKURO] Atori is going after
the Dragon Torque.

96

and its coordinates.

[FUKURO]
Is this nostalgic for you?

109

The Haruka in this dimension

110
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,208
is not the Haruka
we know from ours.

111
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,583
I know.

112
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,833
She must be sacrificed
so we... can continue.

113

It makes you think...

Everything that occurs
here is the beginning

that is to come.

transported here on their own.

We can't lock on them;
their coordinates are unstable.

119

just relax for a little while?

get out of here

and go back to your own room?

I don't really have
time to take a break

just a little bit?

00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,541
[NOEIN]
Haruka...

323
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,583
Think of the future...

324
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,958
The future you wish for...

325
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,625
You have the power
to make it so...

326
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,500
Envision it... Believe it...

327
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,125
What's this?!

328
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,291
[KARASU] Did she substitute it
with a different dimension?

329
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,208
Does this Haruka have the power
to manipulate dimensions?!

330
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,500
[KARASU gasps]

331
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,583
[HARUKA]
I feel weak...

332
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,416
What happened...?

333
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,833
What happened to me...?

334
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,333
Karasu, are you hurt?!

335
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,541
[KARASU]
No.

336
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,208
Wait a minute...
Is that the Dragon Torque?

337
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,625
You secured it?

338
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,625
I have not.

339
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,791
What in the world was
that unusual power?

340
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,000
Where is Atori?

341
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,958
I killed Isuka during combat.

342
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,291
[FUKURO]
What have you done?!

343
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,333
[KARASU] I cannot surrender
the Dragon Torque!

344
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,375
[FUKURO]
Karasu!

345
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,500
[KARASU]
I will not hand over Haruka.

346
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,166
This is bad...

347
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,583
Karasu, you damn fool...

348
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,666
We must get him, and fast.

349
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,708
Tell me you... saw that...

350
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,916
I saw it I think...

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
But... do you believe it?

352
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,208
[UCHIDA]
Good point.

353
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,458
[KOORIYAMA]
Did you get a shot of it?

354
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,166
[KOORIYAMA]
What's this?

355
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,125
[MIYUKI]
Yu? What's wrong? I'm coming in.

356
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:41,833
[phone ringing]

357
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,041
[YU]
Why won't she answer?

358
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,541
[KARASU] You must protect
this girl with your life...

359
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,250
What are you talking about?

360
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,916
[KOSAGI] I can forcefully
transport Karasu.

361
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,458
Not now, dammit!

362
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,250
Yu...

363
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,083
[HARUKA]
Yu!

364
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,416
[YU]
Haruka!

365
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,916
[YU gasps]

366
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,916
Haruka...

367
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,208
Haruka!

368
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,625
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

369
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,250
That summer's day dream.

370
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,916
[KARASU]
This Earth is La'cryma.

371
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,208
[KUINA]
Get him!

372
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,958
[UCHIDA] She may not be able to
come back to this world again.

373
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,208
It's all my fault.

374
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:22,583
[HARUKA]
Next, "The Dimension of Tears."

375
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,708
Where is this place?
