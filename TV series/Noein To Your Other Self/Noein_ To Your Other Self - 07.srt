I'm tellin' you the truth!

I will be the one
to find her! Not you!

Ugh! Look, if she has vanished
because of the tunnel effect,

there is no way you can
possibly find her!

you babbling on about?

Well, that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

And that is why I
keep repeatin' myself!

21

There is a possibility
Haruka encountered

00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,458
a quantum phenomenon.

Yes, I sure have. Ever since

too young to understand.

You can't comprehend
the significance

87
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,666
of the state of de-coherence
occurring in the ordinary world,

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,583
which was thought to be possible
only in the quantum world.

What's "de-coherence"? I don't
understand big words like that.

They should all be in
this world too, right?

Even if your friends
are still actually alive,

93
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,708
they will have nothing
to do with you or your world.

94

I don't get it!
Isn't this our future?

[AMAMIKU] This is only one of
an infinite number of futures.

For you, this is
one possible future.

97
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,375
For us, you are one
option from the past.

98
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,000
So it is the future,
but it isn't the future.

99
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,416
[AMAMIKU]
That's right. You do exist.

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
But to us, it is quite
possible that you do not.

101

[HARUKA]
But how can that be?!

I'm standing right here,
and you're standing over there!

103

Perhaps you're still too young
to comprehend the concept

104
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,333
of multi-dimensional time, but
it is the truth of the Universe.

[AMAMIKU] The future,
the past, and even the present

than the one we're from.

Oh, I don't know,

maybe because aliens have
finally come to invade Earth?

by some aliens!

This isn't something we
should joke about, Miho!

about this, you guys!

[NOEIN] You want to go
to Shangri-la, don't you?

00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,458
That is correct. I wish to
escape from the ring fo destiny.

Both your past,

she's doing quite well.

Yeah, she sure has her mother's
outgoing personality.

175
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,541
They act so similar

it's hard to tell
'em apart sometimes.

Hm?

179
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,541
The girl is far too similar
to the Haruka we know

from our dimension.

She's supposed to be similar.

182
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,125
We got her from
a parallel world.

183
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,916
Are we going to end up turning
our backs on her once again?

184
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,541
[FUKURO] Try not to think
about it, Amamiku.

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,500
It'll only create
more confusion.

[GOKAN] Once we have
obtained the Dragon Torque,

192
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,166
it will create for us
a perfect defense shield.
