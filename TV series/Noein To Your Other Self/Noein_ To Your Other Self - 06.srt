1
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,791
[HARUKA] At that time,
I was blanketed in light.

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,791
I suddenly became
a part of that light,

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,250
tumbling to a distant horizon.

4
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,250
[HARUKA] And someone was
sharing my aurora space.

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,000
I soared to a land
beyond all dimensions.

6
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,291
[HARUKA]
Who is that?

7
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,458
Where are we?

8
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,916
[HARUKA gasps]

9
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,375
[DRAGON KNIGHTS]
Let the Dragon sleep.

00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,458
[KARASU gasps]

11
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,958
[HARUKA gasps]

12
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,916
[HARUKA]
What's wrong?!

13
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,541
It's the Dragon Knights.

14
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,666
Dragon Knights?

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,583
[DRAGON KNIGHTS]
Let the Dragon sleep.

16
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,000
This dimension's
called La'cryma.

17
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,041
It is very different
from your world.

18
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,166
[DRAGON KNIGHTS]
Let the Dragon sleep.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,625
La'cryma?

20
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,125
[DRAGON KNIGHTS]
Let the Dragon sleep.

21
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,208
Never! I won't surrender Haruka!

22
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,916
Take her!

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,250
[DRAGON KNIGHTS] Let the Dragon
sleep. Let the Dragon sleep.

24
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,208
Let the Dragon sleep.

25
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,125
I can't hold on--!

26
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,333
[DRAGON KNIGHTS]
Let the Dragon sleep.

27
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,333
Ah, Karasu!

28
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,125
[HARUKA gasps]

29
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,958
[ENRA] I am assuming the
Dragon Torque is secured?

30
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,833
[GOKAN] We certainly did not
expect that child's body

31
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:06,750
to have accumulated that many
Reizu sub-atomic particles.

32
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,083
[TAIZA] It is impossible
to fully predict

33
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,416
different dimensions.

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,708
[ENRA] The invasion of
Shangri-la is not logical.

35
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,416
[GOKAN]
That's just an excuse.

36
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,416
[TAIZA] They distort dimensions
like attacking savages.

37
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,833
[TAIZA] At any rate,
we can now prevent

38
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,041
Shangri-la from destroying us.

39
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,250
[GOKAN] If we could
incorporate the Dragon Torque

40
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,791
into the Reizu simulator--

41
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,375
[TAIZA]
That is only a hypothesis.

42
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,875
[ENRA]
I believe...

43
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:44,166
...we must see this experiment
through to the end...

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,625
[GOKAN]
...to see the significance

45
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,666
of mankind's existence...

46
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,000
So, will we be...
absolutely recognized

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,625
by the observer of the universe?

48
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,125
Or...?

49
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:06,875
[YU] She disappeared...
right before my eyes...

50
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,666
This bright light suddenly
appeared all around her...

51
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,333
Yu!

52
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,833
She disappeared from
right in front of us, too.

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,375
Remember, guys?

54
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,791
Okay, so was she really with
a guy in a black cape or not?

55
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,458
He took her away,
can't you hear?!

56
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,500
Yu...

57
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,750
Pull yourself together, Yu!
Did she really disappear?!

58
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,041
Or was she taken by somebody?!

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,583
It's...

60
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,791
It's...

61
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,958
It's all my fault...!

62
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,041
Hey... You know that
it's not your fault.

63
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,958
We should go see if
we can find her.

64
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,041
Yeah, you're right.

65
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,250
Perhaps we should
talk to Ms. Yukie.

66
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,333
[AI] With Ms. Yukie?
Do you think she'll believe us?

67
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,125
Oh, why not?! Yeah,
let's call up Ms. Yukie!

68
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,791
We haven't seen her since
summer vacation began!

69
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,500
Why are you so excited?

70
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,416
Hey, could you at least pretend
to be worried about Haruka?

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,083
[ISAMI] Of course I'm worried!
What're you talking about?!

72
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,041
I'm very worried!

73
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,250
You're acting like such a spaz.

74
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,666
You are a horny toad!

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,041
Miho, what did you call me?!

76
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,875
[MIHO] You boys are
like a cat in heat!

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,291
[UCHIDA]
Huh?

78
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,125
It's that boy.

79
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,583
[MIHO] Here, kitty-kitty!
[ISAMI] That's impossible!

80
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,500
[AI] I think you're just
using Haruka as an excuse

81
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,666
to see Ms. Yukie!

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,791
You know she's right.

83
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,333
[ISAMI]
I am not! Take it back!!

84
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,166

please look at this picture?!

85
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,833
[AI]
Haruka?!

86
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,833
Do you know where
Haruka is right now?

87
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,250
Why do you wanna know?

88
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,375
[UCHIDA] If you know
anything, please, tell me.

89
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,833
[YU]
She's gone.

90
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,333
She's what?

91
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,916
Then it's possible
we're too late.

92
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,375
[UCHIDA]
If she moved through dimensions

93
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,333
surrounded by the
foam of Wheeler...

94
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,583
[YU] What does that mean?
What's gonna happen to her?

95
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:02,416
Well, it may not be possible
for her to return to this world.

[HARUKA gasps]

97
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,041
Where am I?

98
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,125
What is this place?

00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey... What...
What're you doing?

Hey, knock it off!

Her readings are stable,
Lady Amamiku.

106
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,041
Don't you know it's against
the law to kidnap people?!

107
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,791
You were brought
here to La'cryma

108
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,458
from a dimension that
still exists in the past.

109
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,625
The past?

110
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,208
According to your perspective,
this world is in the future.

111
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:12,208
Future? What're you
talking about? Where am I?

112
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:17,500
[AMAMIKU] La'cryma. This is
what we call this dimension.

113
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,291
[HARUKA] Hmmm...
He said the same thing...

114
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,458
Tell me, what'd you
do with Karasu?

115
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,291
Well, if you must know...

116
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,458
[KUINA] I didn't expect
you to sink this low.

117
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:50,083
I prevented the monastic
order from disposing of you.

118
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,500
Haruka...

119
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,458
Open your eyes, will ya?!

120
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,708
No matter how much it
may resemble your past,

121
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,000
it is not our world!
Can't you understand that?!

122
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
You're wrong...

123
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,291
I'm not! Don't confuse things!

124
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,916
You will not kill Haruka.

125
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,291
But aren't you responsible
for Isuka's death?

126
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,041
[KARASU]
Yes I am, that's right...

127
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,125
[KUINA]
We also lost Tobi and Atori.

128
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,833
They betrayed us to
remain in that dimension.

129
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,000
[KARASU]
Betrayed...?

130
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,541
You're going to have to give me
all of your strength, Karasu.

131
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,291
[KUINA] You should know
that this dimension

132
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:38,458
is different from our past.
In order to establish

133
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:44,750
our existence...
we were granted the power.

134
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,875
[YUKIE]
If you're... wait a minute!

135
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,541
You're Ms. Uchida, right?

136
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,750
[UCHIDA]
Yes, it is.

137
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,791
I've mentioned this
several times, but...

138
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,291
the children have also witnessed

139
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,291
the same phenomenon that we did.

140
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,000
I guess Mr. Kooriyama's badge
and I.D. are legitimate...

141
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,708
But what is a policeman like him

142
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,125
doing with a
scientist like you?!

143
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,958
I am not going to explain myself

144
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,833
to a simple-minded
schoolteacher like you!

145
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,083
Hey, who in the hell are
you calling simple-minded?!

146
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,458
Ms. Yukie, please don't
start fighting!

147
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,916
[KOORIYAMA] C'mon, calm down.
Come on ladies,

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,333
let's not start a catfight.

149
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
[BOTH]
Piss off!

150
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,833
It's-It's so horrifying!

151
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,791
[AMAMIKU]
It's dinnertime.

152
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,958
[HARUKA]
Ah... okay...

153
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,250
Ugh!

154
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,333
[HARUKA]
Is this even edible?

155
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,791
It is.

156
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,083
[HARUKA]
Uck...

157
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,291
[HARUKA]
Ewww...

158
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,791
Y'know, this really
is kinda tasty.

159
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,750
Is this actually the future?

160
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,791
Because if this really
is the future,

161
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,791
don't you think you're
sort of changing the past

162
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,666
by bringing me to this place?

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,041
[AMAMIKU]
It won't affect our dimension.

164
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,458
Why not?

165
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,166
You see, all of the dimensions
diverge into infinity.

166
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,458
[HARUKA]
I don't understand.

167
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,041
[AMAMIKU] Every dimension
in which you exist

168
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,875
continues on throughout
time to infinity.

169
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,958
You see, even if you were to
remain here for all eternity,

170
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,166
you would only disappear
from the dimension

171
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,666
from which you came. But,
in all the other dimensions,

172
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,291
you would continue to exist.

173
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:04,541
That is why dimensions continue
to flow from past to future.

174
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,916
So, since I'm gone
from my world...

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,708
...nothing is going to change?

176
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:14,458
Not entirely. We are all hoping
that by you being here...

177
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,791
...it will be possible
to change our future.

178
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,666
[ATORI]
Tobi, I feel very weak.

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,208
[TOBI] What do you expect?
We released our pipelines.

180
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,541
[ATORI]
Huh?

181
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,333
[TOBI] Since we took
ourselves off the pipeline,

182
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,583
La'cryma won't be able
to secure our positions...

183
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,333
And they won't
be able to send us

184
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,416
the existence-prolonging data.

185
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
And that's why we're going
to continue to have trouble

186
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,625
stabilizing our existence
in this dimension.

187
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,708
[ATORI]
Damn...

188
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,333
[TOBI]
That's not the worst of it.

189
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:55,333
Because we are unstable,
we could eventually disappear.

190
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,458
[ATORI]
How long do we have?

191
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,000
[TOBI]
I don't know. Even I can't tell.

192
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,000
[ATORI]
You're useless!

193
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,166
But... I wonder if it would
really be all that bad?

194
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,041
What do you mean?

195
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,708
[TOBI] If I had to choose a
world in which to disappear,

196
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,958
this quiet place
wouldn't be so bad.

197
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,125
[ATORI]
Don't be stupid!

198
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,666
I haven't even started
fighting yet, ya hear?!

Bring 'em on!
I'll destroy them all!

200
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:29,416
Before I'm finished,
I'll destroy... everything!

Excuse me, who is she?

202
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,875
Did you call her "Amamicoo"?

203

isn't the future!

that I'll believe anything!

Well, actually, I'm new here.

haven't met somewhere before?

I can get a drink of water?

I'm truly sorry, Lady Amamiku.

[GOKAN]

00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,791
You were given one order,
you will complete it.

The responsiblities you were
given have to be fulfilled.

[AMAMIKU]
I am aware of that.

Bring her back right away.

You cannot fail again.

[AMAMIKU]
I understand.

244
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,750
It's imperative that
we do not alter

245
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,041
the initiation sequencing
for the Dragon Torque.

Do you understand?

00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,208
Yes.

248
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
[FUKURO]
I'm surprised she got away.

She couldn't have gotten
very far on her own.

You're sure?

Were you surprised... at what
Dragon Torque looked like?

To me, La'cryma is the only
reality that truly exists.

I see. But I want to be the one

to bring the
Dragon Torque back here.

315
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,000
What happened to this place...?

316
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,041
Ah?

317
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
[HARUKA gasps]

318
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,916
[AMAMIKU]
Wait!

319
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,375
[AMAMIKU]
Don't bother trying to run.

320
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,125
There is nothing
for you to find here.

321
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,625
Where am I?! What am I doing
in this place anyway?!

322
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,125
[AMAMIKU] I'm sure you
have already realized

323
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,958
that for yourself.

324
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,000
[HARUKA]
It can't be...

325
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,041
[AMAMIKU]
It's true.

326
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,041
Now you know that
this world is the future.

327
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,333
[HARUKA]
This can't be true.

328
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,500
Liar!

329
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm your friend. Ai.

330
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,458
[HARUKA gasps]

331
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:56,333
Ai Amamiku Hasebe.

332
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,416
You can't be... Ai...

333
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,208
No way...

334
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,166
No, that can't be right!

335
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,666
You're too old to be Ai!

336
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,333
It's 15 years in the future
from your timeline.

337
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:14,583
It's 15 years?
This is our future?

338
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:21,833
[HARUKA] Why does the future
of the world look like this?

339
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,791
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

340
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,833
That summer day's dream.

341
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,833
[KOSAGI]
Haruka is dead!

342
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,041
[HARUKA]
Will I ever see anybody again?

343
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,708
[YU]
I have to find Haruka!

344
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,958
[HARUKA]
Next, "Precious Person."

345
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,958
Tell me the truth.
