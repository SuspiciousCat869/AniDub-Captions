1
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,625
[ATORI]
Haruka, somebody's here!

2
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,083
[HARUKA]
What is it, Atori?

3
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,500
Did you hear somebody pull up?

4
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,958
Umm...

5
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,125
[HARUKA]
Huh. I don't see anyone.

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,041
[ATORI]
They were here.

7
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,833
Who was here?

8
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,708
But they didn't
hang around very long.

9
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,541
Well, Kosagi, feeling better?

10
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,041
Calmer, sir, if you care.

11
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,541
We need to secure
the Dragon Torque.

12
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,750
It is the solitary mission

13
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,041
bestowed upon us
as Dragon Soldiers.

14
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,791
It's impossible for you
to capture it by yourself.

15
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,500
[KOSAGI] If I hadn't been
forcefully retransported,

16
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,416
I would have secured her.

17
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,708
It must be approached
with caution.

18
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,125
The Dragon Torque has started
to have a will of its own.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,125
It doesn't matter
what happens to me,

20
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,625
as long as I secure--

21
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,541
[KUINA]
That's enough!

22
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,041
You don't get it.

23
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,250
[KOSAGI] We both know that
La'cryma can't survive

24
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,875
without the Dragon Torque.

25
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,791
[KUINA] That's not it!
Why can't you understand?!

26
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
[KOSAGI]
Wha--?!

27
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,500
[KUINA]
I don't care what happens

28
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,458
to the world of La'cryma...

29
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,708
...because I need you.

30
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,916
[KOSAGI]
Wha-What?

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,750
[KUINA]
I don't wanna lose you...

32
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,083
Kuina!

33
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,875
[KUINA] I want to live my
life with you, Kosagi...

34
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,541
[knocking]

35
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,916
[MIYUKI]
Can I come in?

36
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,875
Oh, looks like another nice day.

37
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
[MIYUKI] So, you've been
studying very hard.

38
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,375
[YU]
Yeah.

39
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,791
[MIYUKI]
And, how's it going?

40
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,458
[YU]
Fine...

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,625
Need a break? If you'd like,

42
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,958
you could help me
with the storage room.

43
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,416
[YU]
I don't know...

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,875
I can't really lift all those
heavy things by myself.

45
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,250
Yeah, I guess so, Mom.

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,416
[MIYUKI]
Um, Yu?

47
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
[YU]
Huh?

48
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,000
This is your last summer break
before you become a teenager.

49
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,833
I guess so. I'm going
to be 13 next year.

50
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,416
That's why I think you should do

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,291
everything you wanna
do this summer break.

52
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,500
Have all the fun
you can squeeze in.

53
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,625
[YU] There's nothing
I really wanna do.

54
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,458
You need to enjoy
your childhood, young man.

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,541
I'll do stuff after I get
through with all the exams.

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,666
But...

57
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,458
Hey, Mom, what's this thing?

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,041
[MIYUKI]
What?

59
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,333
Oh, the video camera.

60
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,583
Really?

61
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,208
Yes, your father bought it

62
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,000
when you came home
from the hospital.

63
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,416
Man, it's huge!

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,958
It was pretty expensive too!

65
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,166
I don't know about this...

66
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,625
[YU sighs]
Boring.

67
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,541
What? A wedding?

68
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,458
[HARUKA]
For your mom and dad?

69
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,833
[MIHO] So why are they
having a wedding now?

70
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,375
[AI] Apparently,
when they got married,

71
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,041
Mom decided not
to have a wedding

72
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
because it was too expensive.

73
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,125
It's always bothered Dad
that they couldn't afford it.

74
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,333
And now they'll have
the wedding of their dreams!

75
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,208
How romantic!

76
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,958
It's cool because they
still get along really well.

77
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,083
That's true! They always
seem so happy together!

78
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,458
I know she's going
to be absolutely stunning

79
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,000
in her wedding dress!

80
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,208
Tres bien!

81
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,250
It's true, Ai.
Your mom's really pretty.

82
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,333
And nice too.

83
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,125
Yeah, but it took her awhile.

84
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,583
Huh?

85
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,916
There's another reason why
they didn't have a wedding.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,833
I hope it's a good one.

87
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,791
You got it.

88
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,250
[MIHO]
What is that?

89
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,208
Oh, she is so cool!

90
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,166
No way this is your mother!

91
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,791
[MIHO squeals]

92
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,625
[AI] This picture was
taken when she was still

93
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,125
in high school,
way before they met.

94
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,750
And my dad is completely
clueless about all of it.

95
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,250
[MIHO]
Lemme see it again, will ya?

96
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,125
[HARUKA] Wow, your mom
just got even cooler!

97
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,791
[ISAMI] Hey, whatcha
lookin' at? Lemme see!

98
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,541
[AI]
Oh, no way!

99
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,833
[ISAMI]
Oh, impossible.

100
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
[AI gasps]

101
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,958
Hey...

102
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,750
[AI]
Where'd you get that thing?

103
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,500
[YU]
I found it at home.

104
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,416
[MIHO]
Wow, that's professional!

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,541
I guess it is.

106
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,208
So, do you know how to use it?

107
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,125
[YU]
Sorta...

108
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,458
Hey, I got an idea!

109
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,041
How'd you like to be
a cameraman at a wedding?

110
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,875
Someone's getting married?

111
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,041
Yeah, Ai's mother
and father are.

112
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,291
And we happen to be
looking for someone to shoot it.

113
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,750
So will you do it?

114
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,458
[YU]
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

115
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,791
[ISAMI]
Cameraman, huh?

116
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,500
Hey that's cool.
Good luck with that.

117
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,958
What's wrong?

118
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,125
It disappeared...

119
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,416
[KOORIYAMA]
Are they out there, Uchida?

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,541
[UCHIDA] Yes, one, two,
three, four, five...

121
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
They're all there.

122
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,541
How unusual. They're all
together again.

123
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,250
[UCHIDA]
I didn't think the lab boats

124
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,833
would get here so quickly.

125
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,500
[KOORIYAMA] Shinohara must've
sent for them well in advance.

126
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,375
It was his plan
to quash the Ab Com

127
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,750
investigation results
from the get-go.

128
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,416
And on top of that,
he used it

129
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,625
to move the project forward.

130
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,250
Him again?
I have to stop this.

131
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,958
There's no way he can use this

132
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,083
location of continuous
abnormal quantum

133
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,333
potential fluctuation to
activate the Magic Circle!

134
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,000
I believe there's an old
saying that goes:

135
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,791
"Arrogance is the path
that leads to self-destruction."

136
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,666
Kooriyama?

137
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
I suppose in the long run,
it's our fault.

138
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,083
We, as adults, are living
proof of that arrogance.

139
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,791
But what we can't do

140
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,875
is destroy the future
for our children.

141
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,375
[TOBI] Haruka's power
may be accelerating.

142
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,291
[KARASU] You think she's making
the dimensions come together?

143
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,750
[TOBI]
That's highly probable.

144
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,833
Hey, Karasu?

145
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,875
[HARUKA] Was the strange
dimension I saw

146
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,541
the world you call "Shangri-la?"

147
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,916
That was about the same
time I started seeing

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
all those other people.

149
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,125
What people?

150
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,083
Well, they're not really people.

151
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,291
Shangri-la...

152
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,708
[HARUKA]
Do you think so?

153
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,708
[HARUKA]
I think they wanna meet me.

154
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,291
Um, but the guy also said
that I would eventually

155
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,583
come to a place
called Shangri-la.

156
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,875
The man in the mask?

157
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,458
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,333
[TOBI] The appearance rates
at the zero point

159
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,375
are increasing tremendously.

160
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,500
It might be linked to that.

161
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,625
It's possible that the
errosion of Shangri-la

162
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,541
may already have started
in this dimension.

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,250
[OPERATOR] Commence revision
of coordinates X-X-X.

164
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:16,791
Countdown.
5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0...

165
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,416
[KUINA]
What are you looking at?!

166
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,708
I mean, what can
you see, Kosagi?

167
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,500
I see... nothing.

168
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,000
We don't have the ability
to observe those coordinates.

169
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,458
That's true... Perhaps we
shouldn't see them.

170
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,958
[OPERATOR]
W-2 is gone. Cool-down.

171
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,625
[KOSAGI] It's happening again...
Observers are falling apart

172
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,125
one after the other.

173
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,375
[KUINA] The dimensional
waiver is accelerating.

174
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,750
[KUINA] The lines have
reached their limit.

175
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,666
[KOSAGI] We must secure
the Dragon Torque immediately!

176
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,125
Nothing more can be
done for La'cryma.

177
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,375
I found something unusual.

178
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,541
Is this lipstick?

179
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,875
I will find a dimension
where we can live together...

180
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,958
[KOSAGI]
You two wait here for me.

181
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,583
[DRAGON SOLDIERS]
Yes ma'am.

182
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,916
[KOSAGI] Your expulsion from
the elite dwelling quarters

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,916
to this place is
your punishment.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,875
How could you allow
the Dragon Torque

185
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,250
and Karasu to escape?
It is only by the mercy

186
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,625
of the leadership department
that you were not eliminated.

187
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,125
[AMAMIKU]
I do not regret my decision.

188
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,625
Uh?

189
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,250
When you see there's a mistake,

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,875
I do not think it is
wrong to correct it.

191
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,333
[KOSAGI] We are fighting to
keep La'cryma in existence!

192
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,750
You people have acted
idiotically and lost

193
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,375
the possibility of a future

194
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,375
by allowing yourselves
to be blinded by the past!

195
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,333
[AMAMIKU]
That's not true, Kosagi.

196
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,833
What?!

197
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,458
[AMAMIKU]
To regret the past,

198
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,416
is to never repeat
the same mistake.

199
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,833
The Dragon Torque has given us

200
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,666
this unique opportunity.
To correct the errors we made.

201
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,166
I can't believe how
confused you've become!

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,375
Don't you see-- it's only a
dimension we've simulated!

203
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,416
The Dragon Torque
itself is no more

204
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,583
than a body of enery
created by a quantum spin.

205
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,833
Believing it is a
human being is merely

206
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,083
the result of
existential interference.

207
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,791
[AMAMIKU]
Maybe. Except for the fact

208
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,541
that I recognized that
girl as Haruka.

209
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,291
[KOSAGI gasps]

210
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,250
And I can tell you
she recognized me.

211
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,291
She called me by my real name.

212
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,708
But... because of her,
Karasu and Fukuro

213
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,958
fought with each other...

214
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,416
...and Fukuro died.

215
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
[AMAMIKU gasps]

216
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,458
[KOSAGI]
Kuina!

217
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,916
You're...

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,250
I have a favor
I want to ask you.

219
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,208
Let me go and defeat Karasu.

220
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,500
Kosagi...

221
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,791
I want to settle it.

[HIGHSCHOOL GIRL A]
I'm so tired. This sucks.

tell us what to do!

you learn some manners?

Did he actually
call us "eye-candy"?

they were being
rude or something!

and given you some help.

00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,708
you sure this is gonna be okay?

317
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,250
It doesn't look weird
from the back, does it?

318
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:53,125
Ooh... It's perfect.
You look great.

319
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,291
Really?

320
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,458
Really. It's sweet.
I could eat you up.

321
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah?

322
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,458
You're a cutie, Haruka.
Definitely my girl.

323
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,250
[HARUKA]
You're embarassing me.

324
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,625
[HARUKA]
See you later!

325
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,291
[ASUKA]
Be careful now!

326
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
[HARUKA gasps]

327
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,083
What's this?!

328
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,375
Has it actually gotten stronger?

329
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,166
[KOSAGI]
It looks just like a child!

330
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,208
The Torque is simply

331
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,541
a convergence of
high-density energy.

332
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,833
If I can just contain
the volatile reaction...

333
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you come here
from the future too?

334
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,541
[KOSAGI gasps]

335
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,208
Please don't fight with Karasu.

336
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,166
[HARUKA] I don't want him
to have to fight anymore.

337
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,916
How did you--

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,583
[HARUKA gasps]

339
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,791
Karasu!

340
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,666
It stopped...

341
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,750
Karasu!

342
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,916
[KOSAGI] You traitor!
I will never forgive you!

343
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,375
I swear I'll take
you down... with me!

344
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,916
Go home, Kosagi.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,875
It's pointless for
the two of us to fight.

346
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,083
[KOSAGI]
Karasu!

347
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you the one
who killed Fukurou?

348
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,416
I'm not.

349
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,333
[KOSAGI] Even if you weren't,
I will destroy you.

350
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
[KARASU]
I cannot disappear yet.

351
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,750
[KOSAGI]
Then fight me, Karasu!

352
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,625
[KOSAGI]
Come on, fight!

353
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,208
Why won't you face me?!

354
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,083
You cannot fight
in your current state.

355
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,541
You're a traitor! You are
nothing but a coward

356
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,416
who betrayed his allies for
an illusion of the past!

357
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,791
[KOSAGI]
I will never forgive you!

358
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,875
[TOBI]
Stop this, Kosagi.

359
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,666
[KOSAGI]
Move!

360
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,833
There's nothing
to gain by killing us.

361
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,250
Doing so won't save La'cryma.

362
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,041
By using the
Dragon Torque's powers,

363
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,000
we can stop the
errosion of Shangri-la!

364
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,125
[TOBI] You're wrong.
Dragon Torque's energy

365
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,291
is not meant to be
used for that purpose.

366
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,000
[TOBI]
I believe it has appeared

367
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,416
to restore every
warped dimension.

368
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,791
[TOBI]
I don't think it's a coincidence

369
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,750
that we found it here.

370
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:46,541
It is a necessity
for every dimension.

371
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,958
That's enough lies!

372
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,583
Besides, you know
you can't kill Karasu.

373
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,583
[KOSAGI gasps]

374
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,750
[TOBI]
Be honest with yourself.

375
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,166
Now it's gone...

376
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,000
Karasu! Return to La'cryma!

377
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,583
Kosagi!

378
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,333
[KOSAGI] You are
well aware that by staying

379
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,750
unconnected to the pipeline

380
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,791
that you will eventually
vanish from this world.

381
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,916
I will protect Haruka.

382
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,291
Karasu... You care
for her that much...

383
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,250
[KARASU gasps]

384
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,791
No, don't!

385
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,041
[KARASU grunts]

386
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,875
[OPERATOR]
The pipeline has been cut off.

387
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,500
She didn't...!

388
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,250
[KARASU]
Kosagi...

389
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,833
I want to be there...
when you die.

390
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,083
[HARUKA]
Baron...

391
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,916
[YU]
Haruka?

392
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,166
Hey, something wrong?

393
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,416
I'm waiting. For Karasu.

394
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,333
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

395
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,666
That summer day's dream.

396
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,958
[AI] Doesn't look
like a plane, does it?

397
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,125
[KUINA yells]

398
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,333
[KUINA groans]

399
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,875
[NOEIN] You can also
collapse and die.

400
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,541
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "Nightmare."

401
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,708
Is the world you
live in a reality?
