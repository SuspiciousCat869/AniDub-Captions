Don't let it hit the ground!

00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,375
[KOSAGI]
Where's Karasu?

3
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,500
[FUKURO]
Go around to the left!

4
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,166
[KOSAGI]
Not again. It has a shield.

Karasu has gotten through!

[KARASU grunting, yelling]

00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,625
[FUKURO]
It's no good. It's collapsing.

11
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,875
Get away from there, Karasu!

12
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,416
Karasu, no!

00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,333
[HARUKA sighs]

14
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,041
[HARUKA] Hey, will you stop.
This is for mom.

15
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,833
Baron, you've gotten
awfully fat lately.

16
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,000
[HARUKA] Mom! Wake up,
breakfast is ready.

17
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,416
[ASUKA]
Haruka, what time is it?

18
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,166
It's already past eight.
I've gotta get to school, okay?

19
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm leaving. Bye!

20
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,541
[ASUKA] See ya later, Honey.
Have a nice day!

21
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,166
That was definitely a ghost.

22
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,750
[MIHO]
They wander around aimlessly

23
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,916
without even realizing
that they're dead.

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
[MIHO] Whatever you do,
[HARUKA] Morning.

25
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,958
[MIHO]
don't ever speak to a ghost...

26
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,625
...'cause if you do, you'll get
pulled into the spirit world.

27
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,625
--Good morning, Ai.
--[AI] Hi, Haruka. Good morning.

28
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,791
What's going on
over there anyway?

29
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,208
[AI] Miho's telling all
about the supernatural.

30
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,750
Oh, I see.

31
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,041
[AI] Kyoko from class 2
says she saw a ghost

32
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,666
in the alley behind the church.

33
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,125
[HARUKA] A ghost?
[school bell rings]

34
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,208
Yeah, a ghost
wearing a black coat.

35
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,708
[YUKIE] Alright everyone.
The bell has rung, class.

36
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
Take your seats right away.

37
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,750
Let's have a discussion

38
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,375
about the summer break
after homeroom, alright?

39
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,541
[ISAMI]
Miss Yukie?

40
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,208
[YUKIE]
Yes, Isami?

41
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,625
Will you go on a date with me
during summer break?

42
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,291
[YUKIE laughs] I'm so sorry,
but my date card

43
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
is all booked up for
the next three years.

44
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,916
[STUDENTS giggling]
No way!

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,166
[BOY]
Loser.

46
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Be sure to watch out for cars

47
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,125
on the way home from school.

48
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,833
[GIRL] I'll see you later!
[YUKIE] No running in the halls!

49
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,791
[AI] Oh yeah, tomorrow night,
you wanna get together

50
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,333
and test your courage
for a night of fright?

51
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,500
Why not?

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,125
We'll hunt for ghosts.
It's summer break,

53
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:14,166
we can stay out late,
so let's all go together.

54
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,458
[AI] What do you say, Isami?
Do you want to go out

55
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,083
for a night of fright?

56
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,583
Did you say night of fright?

57
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,083
Yeah, we're gonna go out tonight
and hunt for ghosts.

58
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,083
Man, you guys are ridiculous.

59
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
You mean to say you
still believe in ghosts?

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,083
There's no way stuff
like ghosts exists.

61
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,750
It's scientifically impossible.

62
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,791
What a bunch of losers.
Right, Yu?

63
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't think so. There are
still things that happen

64
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,375
in this world that can't
be explained by science.

65
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,625
Wrong-o. Listen, there are
no such things as ghosts.

66
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,333
Oh yeah, then let's go
together to make sure?

67
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,041
Well, I guess that settles it.

68
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,041
You're gonna come
with us, Isami.

69
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,958
What? I don't wanna.
Why do I gotta go anyway?

70
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,458
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you're scared.

71
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,083
No, I'm not afraid of any
ghosts. Isn't that right, Yu?

72
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,416
I have to go to cram school,
so I can't go.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,458
But I thought...

74
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,958
[HARUKA]
Yu, wait up!

75
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,916
Where you going?
Are you mad about something?

76
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,041
No. I've just got
a lot on my mind.

77
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,791
Wha...?

78
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,000
[ISAMI]
Man, Yu's been actin'

79
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,708

lately, you know?

He can't help it.

exams coming up soon.

to get... out?

Hey, did you know?

86
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,666
Did I know what?

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,833
That this is the first
day of summer break.

88
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,333
Oh, it's summer break?

89
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,750
I haven't had any kind of
break for five years.

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,041
It's appeared again.

Maybe just pickin' up some
kinda radio signal, huh?

Don't pretend to
know everything.

94
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,250
Relax. How you gonna
report it to headquarters?

95
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,916
They won't give me
the time of day

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,458
with this pitiful
amount of data.

97
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,916
Well, then you're
just gonna have to

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,583
try a whole lot harder, Uchida.

99
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,291
You are the last person
that should be tellin' me that.

100
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,000
And please don't smoke
those filthy things in here.

101
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,708
[HARUKA] Oh wow, look at
the time! Gotta go, bye!

102
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,875

Have a good one, Haruka!

[HARUKA]
I will!

[KOORIYAMA]
Summer break, huh?

105
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,125

Huh?

[MIYUKI]
Yu?

107
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,458
[YU]
Yeah, Mom?

108
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,708
[MIYUKI] Do you understand that
summer school starts today?

109
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,166
[YU]
Yeah.

110
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,083
[MIYUKI] For summer break
I want you to concentrate

111
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,166
only on your studies.

112
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,250
[YU]
I know, Mom.

113
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,583
[MIYUKI]
Yu...

114
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,500
...you can do this.
You must have discipline.

115
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,416
[MIYUKI]
Yu...

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,416
I think it's best if you
stop seeing your friends.

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,333
At least for the time being.
Don't you think?

118
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,625
[ASUKA]
Night of fright?

119
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,458
[HARUKA] Yeah, we're doing
it tomorrow night.

120
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,041
It's okay, isn't it?

121
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,583
Just 'cause it's summer break
doesn't mean you can goof off

122
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,125
for the next three months.

123
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,416
But I'm not goofing off! I made
this lunch for us, didn't I?

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,791
[ASUKA]
This is slightly uncooked.

125
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,125
It's al dente.
It's supposed to be like that.

126
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,833
If you have a problem,
you make lunch.

127
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,500
But Haruka, you made me
a promise to do all the cooking,

128
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,916
at least until I finish
my manuscript, remember?

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
I remember. Just stop
your complaining.

130
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,375
You don't know how hard
it is for a single mother

131
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,125
to raise a kid all on her own.

132
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,708
Dad's paying you alimony
and child support, isn't he?

133
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,166
Look here, you...

134
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,083
It's no secret, Mother...
you forget I'm gonna be

135
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,708
in middle school
next year, you know?

136
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,291
Listen Miss Know-it-all,
are you saying

137
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,083
--that mothers shouldn't work?
--No, that's not what I meant

138
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,791
[ASUKA] That they should stay
at home cooking and cleaning?

139
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,958
[HARUKA] I just don't get
why you spend all your time

140
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,791
making comic books
that don't sell.

141
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,041
[ASUKA]
Please, don't say that.

142
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,166
[HARUKA]
Oh no, I must have dozed off.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,541
[CHILDREN laughing, shouting]

144
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:24,166
[HARUKA] Yu! Have you been
studying all this time?

145
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,916
You're dedicated.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,208
What are you doin' here anyway?

147
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,708
[YU] Why were you waiting
in front of the cram school?

148
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,041
[HARUKA]
I was killing time.

149
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,291
[YU]
You could get into trouble

150
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,375
walking around
this time of night.

151
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
[HARUKA] If you're gonna worry
about something like that,

152
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,625
then you shouldn't be
running away from home.

153
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,208
Well you're the one who
said that we should

154
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,791
run away in the first place...

155
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,541
Just because you wanted to go
to your dad's house in Tokyo.

156
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,416
[HARUKA]
Yu? Wanna run away from home?

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,416
Let's go to Tokyo together.

158
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,083
I was having a fight with
my mom when I said that.

159
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,708
My parents are divorced,
and it's kinda complicated.

160
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,666
And I was really
missing my father.

161
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,875
You're a liar. I was an
idiot to listen to you.

162
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,916
[HARUKA]
Yu!

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,375
Would you wait just a second?

164
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,125
[YU]
Just forget it. Go home.

165
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,000
[HARUKA] I'm not a liar.
You need to have a plan

166
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,541
before running away from home.

167
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,250
[YU]
I know that.

168
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,666
Even if I did run away,
they'd just find me.

169
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,458
And then I'd be taken home.

170
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,708
So what's the point?

171
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:35,083
Sometimes... I wish
I could just run away.

172
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,500
I'll never get outta this town.

173
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,791
I'm gonna be here forever.

174
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,166
But that's not true.
Once you're an adult,

175
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,125
you'll be able to go
anywhere you want to.

176
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,666
I really wanna leave here.
Why aren't I an adult?

177
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,708
Yu...

178
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,166
[YU] I hate being a kid.
I just wish I could

179
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,041
get outta this stupid town.

180
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,041
[YU sobbing]

181
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,666
[HARUKA]
Yu...

182
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,541
I think... I think
I'm going crazy.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,125
Yu...

184
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,708
[HARUKA gasps]

185
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,875
[HARUKA gasps]

186
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,250
That's strange... blue snow?

187
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,791
Huh?

188
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,708
It's him.

189
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,833
[HARUKA yelps]

190
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,500
[KARASU]
The Dragon Torque.

191
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:34,666
[KARASU gasping]

192
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,416
[HARUKA]
He vanished.

193
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
[AI]
Hey, did ya hear?

194
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,958
[HARUKA]
Hear what?

195
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,250
[AI] I got an email from Saeko.
She said that the other night

196
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,250
a headless ghost
appeared at the mall.

197
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,083
[HARUKA]
Did you say ghost?

198
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,875
[AI] Yeah. And she said he
was wearing a black cape.

199
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,916
[HARUKA]
A black cape?

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,583
Yeah, you know what,
I've seen him too.

201
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,875
And he was wearing a black cape.

202
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,583
What? Wait, are you saying you
saw a ghost too? Where was he?

203
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,166
[HARUKA] I don't know.
Does it matter? Who cares?

204
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,083
I do. Now tell me where he was.

205
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,250
[KOORIYAMA]
Uh, excuse me, young ladies.

206
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,916
Listen, do you girls live
around here abouts?

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,250
Maybe you young ladies
could do me a big favor.

208
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,000
There's somethin'
I'm checking into.

209
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,125
I'll make it worth your while
if you girls help me out.

210
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,375
[KOORIYAMA]
I'll get you some juice.

211
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,583
It'll have to be canned though.

212
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,208
Ah! I totally forgot.
We gotta go, Haruka!

213
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,125
[HARUKA] What is it, Ai?
[KOORIYAMA] Hey!

214
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,333
Well that was strange.

215
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,958
I guess they don't
like canned juice.

216
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,833
[AI]
That guy was definitely a perv.

217
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,958
Did you see the way
he was looking at us?

218
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,791
We should really
call the police.

219
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,875
Hey, don't worry.
He acts suspicious,

220
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,708
but he's really not like that.

221
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,333
[AI]
Hm?

222
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,041
[phone ringing]

223
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,458
[KOORIYAMA] Hey, it's Kooriyama.
So, how you doin', Uchida?

224
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,583
How are things goin' over there?

225
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,166
[UCHIDA]
It looks like the data analysis

226
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,958
of the observation satellite
is complete in Tokyo.

227
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,333
[KOORIYAMA]
And?

228
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,833
And it's definite.
They confirmed an irregularity.

229
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,833
[KOORIYAMA sighs] Looks like
we're gonna be here a while.

230
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,166
Yeah, it looks that way.

231
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,541
[KOORIYAMA]
What do we do now?

232
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
[UCHIDA] I'm tryin' to
figure that out right now,

233
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,791
while I'm on this mountain top.

234
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,000
[YU sighs]

235
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,666
[banging]

236
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
[YU]
I'm going to cram school.

237
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,416
[MIYUKI]
Alright. Be careful.

238
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
[ISAMI]
Hey man.

239
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,625
I know that a night of fright
sounds kinda stupid,

240
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,375
but it may not be so bad.

241
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,208
[YU] Isami... you're afraid,
aren't you?

242
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,000
[ISAMI laughs nervously]
Don't be ridiculous.

243
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,375
Hey, look who's here.

244
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,791
Yeah, Yu came along!

245
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,416
I'm not sure if this is really
such a good idea, bro.

246
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,375
[MIHO] I'm sure we'll
see one tonight. I can tell.

247
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,625
I'm getting an eerie feeling.

248
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,750
Like right now, I can feel every
pore in my skin opening up.

249
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,625
[ISAMI] Uh, you know...
the path is dangerous,

250
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,083
so maybe we should go now.

251
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,500
What's the matter? Are you
scared or something, Isami?

252
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,291
Me? No way, I'm not afraid.

253
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,750
[MIHO] Come on you guys,
let's go this way.

254
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,291
I bet that Miho...

255
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,125
...probably doesn't even
believe in ghosts.

256
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,750
She's just doing this
to scare us. Hm?

257
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,416
[MIHO]
Hey everybody, whatcha doin'?

258
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,750
Come on over here. Let's get
this expedition started!

259
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,791
What's the matter?

260
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,000
I thought I saw a light.

261
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,708
Hey, knock it off.

262
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,250
[MIHO]
What's the matter?

263
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,708
[AI] I saw some kind of
light over there.

264
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,583
What? Oh no way.
I bet it's a flying ghost!

265
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,166
A flying ghost is
going through here!

266
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,250
It's a flying ghost?

267
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,916
That's impossible.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,208
What's that?

269
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,625
Huh? A flying ghost!

270
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,958
[YU]
Huh?

271
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,583
[ISAMI]
Man, we're busted.

272
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
[MIHO]
Hey, what's going on?

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,875
[HARUKA]
Mrs. Goto...

274
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,500
You should be at the
cram school doing your studies.

275
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,583
[MIYUKI] I can't believe you'd
do something like this.

276
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,166
Hey, wait a minute. Mrs. Goto!

277
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,625
This is what happens when
you see these children.

278
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,541
[OPERATOR]
Coordinate fix complete.

279
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,458
Countdown.

280
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,333
[KARASU grunting]

281
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,291
[ISAMI] Well that kinda
took the fun out of it.

282
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,000
Come on now, don't be like that.

283
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,750
If you wanna have
any kind of encounter,

284
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,375
you have to wish hard
with all your might.

285
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,833
Wish hard? That's how you do it?

286
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,166
[MIHO] That's right. Alright
now, everybody wish! Yeah!

287
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,875
Mr. Ghost! Mr. Ghost,
please come out!

288
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,041
[ISAMI] I'm sure there has
to be another way to do this.

289
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,083
[AI]
Hey, are you worried about Yu?

290
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,833
Huh? No. I was just thinking.

291
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,291
Oh honestly.

292
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,666
Haruka, your feelings are
written all over your face.

293
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,125
W-What?

294
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,000
[MIYUKI] The cram school
called, and they said

295
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,666
you hadn't shown up yet.
I was so humiliated.

296
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:26,166
What were you doing out so late
at night with those other kids?

297
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,875
[MIYUKI] Haruka's mother
let her be there, didn't she?

298
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,083
She allows the girl
to run around wild.

299
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,791
Her mother is far too lenient.

300
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,083
[YU]
I...

301
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,625
Huh?

302
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:40,041
[YU]
I'm going... I'm going crazy.

303
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,791
Stop the car.

304
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,333
Stop the car!

305
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:53,208
Huh? Blue snow.
It's happening again.

306
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,666
[AI]
What's the matter, Haruka?

307
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,083
Just look at that.
It's snow. Blue snow.

308
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,541
Huh? Blue snow?

309
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,416
Oh quit it. There can't be snow
in the middle of summer.

310
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,833
Ai...

311
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,875
It's getting late.
Haven't you had enough?

312
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,250
[MIHO] No, I'm not going
home until I see one.

313
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,333
[ISAMI] But I'm starving.
I really think we should

314
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,916
head back soon, don't you?

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,250
Miho!

316
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,958
[ISAMI]
I can't see...

317
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,791
What's wrong with this?

318
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,791
The battery's dead.

319
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,500
Isami... look over there.

320
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
Uh, what? What's that?

321
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,833
It's a shadow.
It's a shadow from a tree.

322
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,875
What's going on, Miho?

323
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,208
[MIHO]
I see one.

324
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,125
Huh? See one what?

325
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:55,875
[KARASU groaning]

326
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,833
[KARASU screams]

327
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,916
[AI, MIHO scream]

328
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,416
[ISAMI whimpers]

329
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,416
[ISAMI yelps, whimpers]

330
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,541
It's touching my leg.

331
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,166
[KARASU groans]

332
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,791
[ISAMI whimpering]

333
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,208
What's the matter, Miho?

334
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,166
[HARUKA]
Miho!

335
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,583
Come on. Run, Haruka!

336
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,666
[HARUKA] Huh?
[AI] Hurry!

337
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,583
[OPERATOR]
One bird has disappeared.

338
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,333
Seven birds remain.

339
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,333
[KARASU] A reaction to the
high density Reizu...

340
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,250
Aren't ghosts supposed
to be legless?

341
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
It's impossible. That thing
couldn't have been real.

342
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
[MIHO]
That is definitely a ghost.

343
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,291
We have seen a ghost tonight!
Isn't that amazing?

344
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,875
Why are you so happy?

345
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,708
Listen, that was not a ghost.

346
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,916
[AI]
What?

347
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,333
It's too strange.

348
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,750
Well, he can't help
being strange. He is a ghost.

349
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,875
Huh?

350
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,375
It's coming this way.

351
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,041
[AI]
Huh?

352
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,083
What is it?

353
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,375
We have to get away.

354
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,291
Haruka, what's wrong?

355
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,541
Hey, hurry guys. Come on, hurry.

356
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,041
[MIHO] Something is flying,
and it's coming right at us!

357
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,083
[ISAMI]
Impossible.

358
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,625
[HARUKA]
Everybody run for it! Hurry!

359
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,125
[KARASU]
Is that it?

360
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,541
This can't be happening!

361
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,250
Apparently it's a
land-bound ghost.

362
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,291
I don't get it.
What's happening?

363
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,208
[HARUKA]
He's after me.

364
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,416
I've gotta get him
away from the others.

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,208
[ALL panting]

366
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:50,333
[HARUKA panting]

367
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,833
[HARUKA yelps]

368
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,208
[HARUKA]
Stay back!

369
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,541
[HARUKA gasps]

370
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,666
[ALL panting]

371
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,875
It's gone. It's not
chasing us now.

372
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,500
Are you sure about that?

373
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,541
[MIHO]
I wonder where it went.

374
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,041
[YU]
Where's Haruka?

375
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,750
[ISAMI]
Wait! I thought she was with us!

376
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,875
Wait a sec. You look familiar.

377
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,291
[HARUKA]
I know who you are.

378
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,125
You are...

379
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,041
[YU]
Haruka!

380
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,333
Huh?

381
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,750
[YU grunts]

382
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,166
Oh, Yu.

383
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,666
Who are you?

384
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,291
What do you want?

385
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,958
Answer me.

386
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:57,041
[KARASU] I get it now.
This dimension must be...

387
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,333
[KARASU cackling]

388
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,541
I'm afraid you can't do it.

389
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,708
You see, there is nothing
at all that you can do

390
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,583
to protect the young lady.

391
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,291
Who are you?

392
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,750
Can't you see? I'm you.

393
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,041
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again.

394
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,583
That summer day's dream...

395
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,958
Oh crap, my right arm
didn't make it.

396
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,791
[HARUKA]
What's happening?

397
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,500
You are very lucky.

398
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:23,125
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "Runaway."

399
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,750
[HARUKA]
Who are you?
