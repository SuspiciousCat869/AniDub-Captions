[HARUKA]
Ah...

00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,125
He is here, isn't he?!

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,250
Yu, come down here now!

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,625
I know that you're
hiding here! Yu!

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,875
[HARUKA]
Wait a minute! Please

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,250
You're interfering
in my son's life!

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,791
[ASUKA] What's going on?
Who's shouting?

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,458
Why, Miyuki, I haven't
seen you for so long.

9
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,666
What brings you by here
so early in the moring?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,041
Uhm...Mom...

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,666
I want to see my son, now!

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,375
What? Is he here?

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,041
Is he Haruka?

14
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,708
[HARUKA]
Uhm...

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,791
Heh, heh...

16
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,208
[ASUKA]
Well, since you're here,

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,416
we should sit and catch up.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't have time for that now.

19
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,166
I am here to pick up my son
and to take him home.

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,958
[ASUKA] Well, I see you
haven't changed one bit.

21
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,666
You're still as
impatient as ever.

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,250
I beg your pardon?

23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,666
Come on. Stay for
one cup of coffee.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,041
[ASUKA] Haruka, get out a pair
of slippers for our guest

25
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,500
Okay! Heh...

26
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,875
Here you are.

27
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,083
[uncomfortable laugh]

28
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,125
If you insist.

29
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,000
[KARASU] There's something
I want to tell you.

30
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,416
What... do you want?

31
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,291
[KARASU]
Haruka...

32
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,500
You will protect her
with your life!

33
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,750
Uh...

34
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,875
Just what right do
you think you have

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,083
to tell me what to do?

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,791
I can...

37
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,291
...because I am you!

38
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,041
[YU gasps]

39
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,416
I hope they're okay.

[BARON barks]

41
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,625
Baron, be quiet.

[BARON whines]

43
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,000
That's a good boy.

44
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,458
So, do you think mom will be
able to pull this one off?

45
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,416
[ASUKA] You know, it really
has been such a long time.

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,166
I don't think you've
stopped by to chat for ages.

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,916
Remember you used to
come over all the time?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,750
[glasses clinking]

49
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,541
What do you have there?

50
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,750
How 'bout we have
a little drink? Hm?

51
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,166
It's too early in the day
to start drinking.

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,791
I can't think of
a better time for it.

53
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,750
[ASUKA] 'Sides, it's
happy hour somewhere.

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
[MIYUKI]
Asuka!

55
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,375
[ASUKA] This is a very
rare year. Hmm, I can't...

56
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,583
I think mom has lost her mind.

57
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,041
You're just as
irresponsible as ever.

58
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,250
You're right,
some things never change.

59
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,500
Why, thank you.

60
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,750
I work really hard,
trying to stay so young.

61
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,500
You're hopeless.

62
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,291
Let's start with a little toast:

63
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,833
To my good friend, Miyuki!

64
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:35,708
[MIYUKI]
What?

65
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,458
Go ahead! Raise your glass.

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,666
[MIYUKI]
But I...

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,333
[ASUKA]
Cheers!

68
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,041
That's right. I forgot.
I have to warn him.

69
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,041
Come on, Baron.

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,708
[BARON barks]

[YU gasps]

72
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,041
You're pathetic

73
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,416
What're you? Some freak that
gets off on scaring kids?

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,958
[KARASU] Why do you
always run like a coward?

75
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,666
Get this into your thick skull.
It's no use running away.

76
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,000
If you run, then you're
going to lose.

77
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,125
If you don't want
to lose, then fight.

78
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,666
At least have
the courage to fight.

[KARASU grunts]

Baron, not now.

[BARON whines]

87
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,458
[HARUKA] Your mom knows
you're here. What should we do?

88
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,416
[YU]
Just forget it.

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,791
[YU]
Even if I kept hiding in here,

90
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,375
she'd eventually find me.

91
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,958
You're wrong.

92
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,583
[KARASU]
Don't bother with him.

93
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,000
[HARUKA]
What?

94
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,625
He's too self-absorbed
to understand.

95
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,500
He should try to think
of others for a change.

96
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,166
Please don't talk like that.

97
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,916
If you're really
him In the future,

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,916
why don't you tell him
what he's supposed to do?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,291
[YU] Is that really
me in the future?

100
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,791
It doesn't make any difference.

101
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,041
He has to learn
this stuff himself.

102
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,250
Stop that. That's not very nice.

103
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,458
[YU thinking]
How does she know him?

104
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,541
[YU]
Forget it!

00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,833
I don't really
believe him anyway.

107

Who cares what he says?

Just wait a minute, Karasu.

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,625
You're no good to anyone...

112
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,083
...without some guts!

113
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,041
Hey! Don't act so
tough just because

114
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,666
you're an adult!

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,416

This stupid jerk
isn't me in the future!

How can he be me if he
doesn't understand

119
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,958
anything about me at all?

120

Yu...

121
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,833
So what happened between
the two of you anyway?

122
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
It's... It's nothing important.

123
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,125
I can assure you.

124
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,708
Well, why don't you
stay right here,

125
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,208
and relax for a little bit?

126
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,208
[MIYUKI]
I'm afraid I can't do that.

127
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,750
It's an important time for him.

128
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,208
He needs to study
for his entrance exams.

129
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,083
It's important for you.

130
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,083
[MIYUKI]
Why are you being sarcastic?

131
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,375
You're making fun of me

132
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,166
because I want my child
to study and do well?

133
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,875
No, no. That's not
what I meant...

134
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,208
[MIYUKI]
You've always been that way.

135
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,291
Constantly patronizing me.

136
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,583
No I wasn't.

137
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,750
Then why did you pick
a college to go to

138
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,625
without even telling me?

139
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you saying?

140
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,000
You went away to that
art school in Tokyo!

141
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
Now, hold on a minute!

142
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,458
I told you as soon as I
found out I got accepted.

143
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,541
Don't you dare lie to me!

144
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,041
Huh?

145
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:33,125
You knew that I wanted to go
to that University in Tokyo.

146
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,666
So long Miyuki.

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,791
I have practice this morning,
so I'm going without you.

148
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,375
Don't be late for school.

149
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,375
Emi, come back here!
Wait for me!

150
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,541
[MIYUKI]
Before she died,

151
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,458
my big sister was
supposed to go to college.

152
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:52,250
I... wanted to go
in her place...

153
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
...but my mother didn't
think I was good enough

154
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,833
to go to college.

155
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,958
[ASUKA]
I never knew that.

156
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,291
[MIYUKI] She always
loved Emi more than me.

157
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,333
I felt rejected by her.

158
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,875
[MIYUKI]
I never got over the pain.

159
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,708
[YU]
I wonder why.

160
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,166
[HARUKA]
Why what?

161
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,583
[YU] She says I'm the spitting
image of my late aunt.

162
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,916
That's why she says
I should study so hard

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,708
and get into a
very good college.

164
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,416
In fact, she insists
that I cannot fail.

165
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,916
Asuka, can I have another?

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe you should
slow down a little.

167
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,458
[slurred]
I don't care.

168
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,208
This wine is really very good.

169
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,000
[ASUKA] O... kay...
Heh, heh... Here's a refill.

170
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,666
[MIYUKI]
My son is a very good boy.

171
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm sure he'll turn out
just like my sister Emi.

172
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,083
[ASUKA]
He will?

173
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,041
Yes, I'm certain.
You agree with me, don't you?

174
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,000
Um... Well, yes.

175
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,416
[MIYUKI]
Oh goodie... Hee...

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,083
They are so alike, it's scary.

177
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,208
He'll do it!

178
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,166
[ASUKA]
Of course he will.

179
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,875
[MIYUKI]
I just know it!

180
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,750
[ASUKA]
Oh...

181
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,958
Huh?

182
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,666
Well, that's one
way to finish it.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,750
[YU] There's some photos
on top of the piano

184
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,208
in the living room.

185
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,750
Photos?

186
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,250
[YU]
There's one of my mom,

187
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,208
from when she was
in middle school.

188
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,791
In it, she's standing
next to my aunt.

189
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,875
One time, I asked
her about her sister...

190
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,541
...and she told me:

191
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,250
My sister, Emi was so smart,

192
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,083
and she was a great athlete.

193
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,000
[YU] That's she's cheerful
and has lot of friends.

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,875
[MIYUKI] So I am sure
you'll become just like her.

195
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,958
[YU]
It was kinda creepin' me out.

196
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,416
I'm so sorry.

197
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,166
It's no big deal.

198
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,625
I'll just buy another bottle.

199
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,916
I'll be right back.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,916
I'll see you in a bit.

201
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,125
I don't understand it.

202
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,541
Why does she always compare me
to my aunt all of the time?

203
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,250
Oh...

204
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,291
[YU]
Don't you think it's weird?

205
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,500
I've never even met her.

206
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,833
I don't get it.

207
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,416
It all started one day
after my grandmother died.

208
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,625
She just started to
talk about Aunt Emi.

209
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,333
[HARUKA]
Then let's go ask her about it.

210
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,375
[YU]
Huh?

211
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,916
Let's go downstairs
and ask your mom

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,166
why she compares
you to her sister.

213
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,958
I don't think
that's a good idea.

214
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,083
[HARUKA]
Come on.

215
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,500
Uh. Ahh...

216
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,708
[YU]
Geh! Forgot it!

217
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,250
[HARUKA]
Now! You have to ask her.

218
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,500
[YU] Dammit, Haruka!
Ngh! I don't wanna!

219
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,125
[HARUKA]
Just do it!

220
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,916
[YU]
Ngh! Knock it off!

221
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,500
Oh, Emi...

222
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,250
[HARUKA]
Mrs. Goto?

223
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,583
[MIYUKI gasps]
Huh?

224
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
[MIYUKI]
Yu...!

225
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,375
Mrs. Goto, there's something
we'd like to ask you.

226
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,083
What are you doing
over here, young man?

227
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,291
We are going to go home
together, right this instant!

228
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,500
Listen, I wanted to know--

229
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,500
No excuses, young man.

230
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Please, Mrs. Goto, listen to us.

231
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,166
[MIYUKI] Haruka, this is
none of your concern.

232
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,958
We wanted to know
why you constantly

233
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,166
compare your son
to your big sister.

234
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,375
[MIYUKI gasps]

235
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,958
Your son told me
that you started

236
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,833
comparing him to your big
sister about two years ago.

237
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,000
Two years ago? What are
you talking about?

238
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,791
[MIYUKI gasps]

239
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,500
When my mom died...?

240
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,875
She's right.

241
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,000
It started after Grandmother's
funeral in Sapporo.

242
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,250
[MIYUKI gasps]

243
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:54,958
[MIYUKI] Mom, I'm sorry.
It should have been me.

244
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,250
[MIYUKI]
Please stop!

245
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,333
Please, stop it! Stop this!

246
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,583
Stop it!

247
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,750
[KARASU gasps]

248
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,916
[KARASU]
The dimension has wavered.

249
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,750
[YU gasps]

250
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,791
My mom, she's...

251
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,333
[YU]
She's disappeared.

252
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,791
[MIYUKI grunts]
Huh...?

253
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,791
[MIYUKI]
Yu? Haruka? Where are you?

254
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,083
[MIYUKI gasps]

255
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,166
I know that chair.

256
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,375
[GIRL'S VOICE A]
I'm home!

257
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,541
[MIYUKI gasps]
Haruka?

258
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,333
[GIRL'S VOICE A]
Mom? Mom?!

259
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, I guess she must be out.

260
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,041
Come on in, Miyuki!

261
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,291
[GIRL'S VOICE B]
Okay!

262
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,500
Do you want something
cold to drink, Miyuki?

263
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,583
[MIYUKI]
Huh?

264
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,708
[GIRL'S VOICE B]
Sure! Asuka...

265
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,541
[MIYUKI gasps]

266
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm totally serious.

267
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,583
I wish you would believe me.

268
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,375
I'm going to
run away from here.

269
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,875
That's why I asked
you over here,

270
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,291
because I was afraid
you were gonna run away.

271
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,375
[YOUNG MIYUKI] I really am
gonna do it, you know.

272
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,541
It's easy to talk about
running away from home,

273
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,333
but do you even have a plan?

274
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,916
[YOUNG MIYUKI] I do.
I brought my life savings.

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,916
Ohh... Really? You did?

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,166
What's this?

277
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,333
That's me and Asuka...

278
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,375
...from when we were
in middle school.

279
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,333
[MIYUKI]
Where am I?

280
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,041
Karasu!

281
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,375
Karasu, what do I do?

282
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,291
Mrs. Goto... Yu's mother...
She... vanished.

283
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,833
[KARASU gasps]
She did?

284
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,583
It's the truth! My mother's
vanished. She's gone.

285
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,416
I wanna know
why she disappeared.

286
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,208
Do you know something I don't?

287
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,083
She must have had contact
with another dimension.

288
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,000
Huh?

289
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,375
What are you saying?

290
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,875
[KARASU]
People's thoughts can sometimes

291
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,208
influence other dimensions.

292
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,708
People's thoughts?

293
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,333
Sometimes their thoughts can
even have the power to interfere

294
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,250
with the atoms that form all
of the matter in the universe,

295
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,041
blurring the dimensional lines.

296
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,666
[KARASU]
The Dragon Torque...

297
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,250
[YOUNG MIYUKI]
I mean, I loved my sister too...

298
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,333
She was so smart and cheerful,
and kind to everyone.

299
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,666
I really wish it was me that
had died, instead of her.

300
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,083
[YOUNG ASUKA]
Miyuki!

301
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,458
I think my mother would be
much happier that way too.

302
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,666
Hey, you can't start
thinking like that.

303
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,208
But she... never loved me nearly
as much as she loved Emi.

304
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,208
That was a hard time for me.

305
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,791
[MIYUKI] My mom made me feel
like I wasn't even there.

306
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,000
She always gave Emi
far more attention

307
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,000
than she gave me.

308
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,375
[HARUKA]
Where is she, Karasu?

309
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,375
[KARASU]
In another dimension.

310
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,583
A dimension of her own thoughts
that she can't erase.

311
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,250
Dimension of thoughts?

312
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,416
Tell me, where is it?

313
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,875
The past. It must be
located in her past.

314
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,083
If this happened to her
because of my power,

315
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,208
then I can use it
to bring her back, right?

316
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
It's not easy to get a fix

317
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,375
on the dimension that
she's transported to.

318
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,291
Searching through the
infinite number of worlds,

319
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,541
would be like trying to find
one grain of sand in the ocean.

320
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,250
Nevertheless, you might
be able to do it.

321
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,125
Just tell me how!

322
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
You have the power inside you.

323
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,166
You altered the flow
once before, didn't you?

324
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,708
I did?

325
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,250
But I really don't remember
at all how I did it.

326
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,166
I know you can do it.

327
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,875
You just have to
believe in yourself.

328
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,916
Uh-huh!

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
What's going on?

330
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,416
[HARUKA pants, gasps]

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,666
[HARUKA]
It's not working.

332
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,041
I don't think I can do it.

333
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,416
You can. Trust yourself, now.

334
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,708
Gimme a second.

335
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,041
I have to figure out
what was in her thoughts.

336
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,958
Karasu, I'm going
to try downstairs.

337
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,291
[KARASU]
Hmm?

338
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,958
I have a feeling that
I'll be able to get closer

339
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,333
to her thoughts that way.

340
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,750
Hey, Haruka? Wait!

341
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,625
Haruka...?

00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,791
[HARUKA gasps]

343

[YU]
Haruka! Hey, what's going on?

344
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,750
Your mom never really
left the house after all.

345
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,583
Huh?

346
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,750
Haruka, would you
tell me what's happening?

347
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,791
I just have to sense her--
what her thoughts are.

348
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,625
[YOUNG ASUKA] I'm sure your
mom and dad would worry

349
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
if you ran away.

350
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,125
[YOUNG MIYUKI]
No, they wouldn't.

351
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,791
They would too be worried.

352
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,666
I'm sure of it.

353
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,750
Do you think they would care,
even a little bit?

354
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,000
[MIYUKI] I wanted to be
just like my sister.

355
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,916
[MIYUKI] I wanted to
be loved, like she was.

356
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,166
[MIYUKI] I didn't wanna
run away from home.

357
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:35,083
[MIYUKI] I just wanted to
get my mother's attention.

358
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,791
But I never ran away.

359
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,500
I just went up the mountain
on the ropeway...

360
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,458
...and came home again,

361
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,708
so she did never
worry about me.

362
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,625
Yu, would you please
give me a bit of space?

363

I hear her!

Please bring

What is this thing?

00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,583
She's gone... Uh... No!

[MIYUKI gasps]

00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,625
And her travel bag
is missing, too.

[ASUKA'S MOTHER] Don't worry.
Miyuki is here with us.

But I think she and
Asuka are both asleep.

[MIYUKI'S MOTHER sobs]
That girl...

381
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,666
She made me so worried.

382

Did you actually
worry about me mother?

383

[MIYUKI'S MOTHER] Emi... died
in a car accident last year.

384
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,958
If I lost Miyuki as well,
I don't know what I would do.

[ASUKA'S MOTHER]
It's all right,

so please don't
scold her too much.

I just want to see her again.

meal, hamburger.

No, Mother, it wasn't me.

It was Emi who
loved hamburgers.
