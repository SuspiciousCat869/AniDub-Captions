1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,791
Ahhun!

2
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,625
[HARUKA panicked]
Why would you do that?

3
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,083
You're friends.

4
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,666
Just tell my why.

5
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,375
You really never change, do you?

6
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:43,708
Huh?

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,875
[FUKURO]
Farewell, Haruka...

8
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,083
[HARUKA]
Ahh!

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,958
Oh no!! Isami!

10
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,125
Hmm?

11
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,541
[BARON whines]

12
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,125
[HARUKA]
Baron.

13
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,958
Karasu...

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,708
[FUKURO]
You're as sloppy as ever.

15
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,291
It's merely a tremor,
but I can sense you.

16
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,000
You're by the sea.

17
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,833
Huh?

18
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,875
You boosted the Reizu output.
What are you planning?

19
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,291
[FUKURO chuckles]

20
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,958
A little something special
for an old friend of ours.

21
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,291
You mean Karasu?

22
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,833
Maybe.

23
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,458
If you're going to fight him,
make sure you kill him.

24
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,416
[FUKURO]
Hmm...

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,666
I will never forgive him.

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,583
He betrayed his friends
without a thought.

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,041
He deserves a slow
and painful death.

28
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,375
I had no idea...

29
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,291
...that you were so
passionate about this.

30
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,916
I hope you're not going to
let him get away with it.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,666
[FUKURO] If you don't trust me,
then kill him yourself.

32
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,166
[KOSAGI gasps]

33
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,833
Killing that weasel
is fine with me!

34
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,541
I would like to tear him apart!

35
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,750
Go ahead then.

36
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,958
[KOSAGI]
Hmm?

37
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,125
Ahhh...

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,458
[FUKURO] You're still in
love with him, aren't you?

39
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,708
What? No! Uh...

40
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm not! You hear me!

41
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,208
I'm not!

42
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,208
Okay, you're not.

43
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,708
I'm not...

44
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,500
[KOSAGI]
What will you do now?

45
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,583
[FUKURO] I will settle
things with Karasu.

46
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,291
It's how we both want it.

47
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,375
Don't even think
of interfering, 'kay?

48
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375
Uh?

49
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,708
[ISAMI chuckles]

50
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,041
[HARUKA] The cherry
blossoms were blooming

51
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,875
the last time I saw you.

52
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,750
Uh-huh. No, that's all right.
It's really okay, Dad.

53
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,750
I'll just be happy to spend
some time with you.

54
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,375
[MAYUZUMI]
Are you all right, Haruka?

55
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,333
I mean, what's wrong with you?
You sound a little down.

56
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,333
It's just...

57
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,708
[MAYUZUMI]
Yes?

58
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,000
I know these two friends
who might get into a fight.

59
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,416
I wanna stop it.

60
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
[MAYUZUMI] A fight?
Who are you fighting with?

61
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,708
No, it's not me, Dad.

62
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,708
I'm talking about
two boys I know.

63
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,833
[MAYUZUMI]
Two boys? Ha ha. Don't worry.

64
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,750
Boys are a lot
different than girls.

65
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,416
Let 'em have a good fist fight.
They'll patch it up afterwards.

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,416
[HARUKA]
No! They can't do that.

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,291
There's no way that can happen.

68
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,125
[MAYUZUMI chuckles] Sometimes I
forget you're my little girl.

69
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,833
Boys and girls fight
differently, that's all.

70
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,916
Okay, honey, I have
to get back to work now.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,375
I'll call you again soon.

72
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,708
[HARUKA] Okay, Dad. I can't
wait to see you next week.

73
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,250
[MAYUZUMI]
Me too, sweetie. Bye now!

74
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,625
[HARUKA]
Bye!

75
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,541
[ISAMI] Maybe I should go to
middle school in Tokyo too.

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,250
[YU]
What? Why would you do that?

77
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,708
Because if I'm
gonna play soccer,

78
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,208
it'd be better to play
soccer in Tokyo.

79
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,458
But when I talked to
my brother about it,

80
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,083
he said that it costs too
much money to go there.

81
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,166
How can I be a big soccer star?

82
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,708
Stop it!

83
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,833
Isami, if you're gonna play
soccer you should go to Italy.

84
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,083
--[ISAMI] Whaaa...?
--[YU] Uh...

85
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,625
Wait a minute. That's not right.

86
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,208
Is it Brazil?

87
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,958
[ISAMI]
Hey, dude, I wasn't really

88
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,166
talking about soccer anyway.

89
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,041
[YU]
I know.

90
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,416
Huh?

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,833
[YU] You're thinkin',
why go all the way to Tokyo

92
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,625
to study if I don't even know
what I wanna do, right?

93
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,625
I never said anything
like that, dude.

94
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,625
[YU] You're lucky. You've found
something you like to do.

95
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,625
I've got nothing.

96
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:46,333
So why can't it be my goal
to get accepted by the school?

97
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,333
[HARUKA]
Yu!

98
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,458
Huh?

[HARUKA pants]

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,666
Hi boys.

102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,666
Good, you're together.

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,875
[ISAMI]
What's goin' on, Haruka?

104
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,166
Have you seen Karasu?

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,875
[ISAMI]
No, haven't seen him.

106
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,333
He's not at the house.

107
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,583
[ISAMI]
Huh?

108
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,833
[HARUKA] He hasn't been
home since yesterday.

109
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,125
I feel like...
something's really wrong.

110
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,291
So would you guys help
me go look for him?

111
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,500
If you don't know where he went,

112
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,208
it's kinda hard
to go look for him.

113
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,625
If you're so worried about him,

114
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,833
why don't you go home and
wait for him by yourself,

115
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:17,750
and quit buggin' us?

116
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,083
Chill out, dude.

117
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,875
[HARUKA]
No, he's right.

118
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,791
I'm just going to go
check out a few more places.

119
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,291
[ISAMI]
Haruka!

120
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,000
Hold up, bro!

00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,208
Hey, what'd you go
and say that for?

122
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,666
C'mon man, where're you goin'?

123
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,958
Uh... Oh, now what?

[KARASU]
Took you long enough.

125
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,416
[FUKURO]
Get up.

[FUKURO] Damn. I guess
I underestimated you.

129
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,041
Is this gonna be the very last
time we play together, Karasu?

130
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,791
Karasu!!

Ha! You're done!

00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,250
Uh...?

00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,291
Huh...?

gonna get as a souvenir?

something white.

00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,666
What?

[HARUKA gasps]

146
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,583
[MAYUZUMI]
Haruka, are you still asleep?

147
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,291
You better get up,
or you'll be late for school.

148
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,250
[HARUKA]
Dad?

149
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,541
[YU] So, did you
hear from your father?

150
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,541
[HARUKA]
Yu?

151
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,208
So, what did he say to you?

152
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,416
Did he... say something

153
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,125
about not running
away from home?

154
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,458
I don't really understand
at all what I'm doing here.

155
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
[TIME DRIFTER]
That dimension is an illusion

156
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,458
that you did not choose.

157
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,166
[HARUKA]
Who are you?

158
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,333
I am known as a time drifter.

159
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,666
There are infinite
dimensions in existence.

160
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,333
An infinite numbers
of yourselves as well.

161
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,125
In the midst of it all, Haruka,

162
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,208

somewhere in another dimension

327
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,791
[MASKED MAN]
Haruka.

328
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,958
There is something
I wish to tell you.

329
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,708
[MASKED MAN] I wanted to
tell you the real truth

330
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,791
about the future.

331
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,458
Augh!!

332
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,208
[MASKED MAN]
You see? It never changes.

333
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,000
Isami!!

334
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:35,000
I... wish I could
see Ai again... Ugh....

335
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,083
Somebody help us, please!

336
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,833
You gotta hold on!
Just hold on, please!

337
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,291
[HARUKA] Please!
Somebody, please help me!

338
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,750
[MIHO]
Hey, look!

339
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,125
Uh. Over there!

340
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,500
What is that?
Is it the blue snow again?

341
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,083
Blue snow?

342
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,458
But that suff looks like
it's going towards the sky,

343
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,291
not falling from it.

344
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,333
Uh, wha? Wh-What's a matter?

345
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,000
I really don't know.

346
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,916
I just got sad from some reason.

347
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,250
You're just imaging things.
I'm sure it's nothing.

348
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:54,041
[bells toll]

349
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,125
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

350
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,791
That summer day's dream.

351
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,125
[HARUKA]
Hold on, Karasu!

352
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,541
[YUKIE]
Hold on tight, everyone!

353
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,166
[TOBI] There is absolutely
no way our future

354
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,583
is laid out for us.

355
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,791
[HARUKA]
Next episode, "The Wish."

356
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,458
Please, tell him how I feel.
