1
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,000
[OPERATOR] Fixed-reverse
calculation complete.

2
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,500
[KUINA]
She's here!

3
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,208
[KUINA laughs]

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,708
[KUINA] Dragon Torque! I have
waited a long time for you!

5
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,291
[HARUKA gasps]

6
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,000
[KUINA]
What?!

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,875
[KUINA]
Karasu!

8
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,916
[HARUKA]
Yu!

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Stop that!

10
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,666
[KUINA]
You dare appear with me again?!

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,791
[KARASU]
Haruka!

12
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,625
[HARUKA]
No!

13
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,875
Let go of him, right now!

14
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,583
[HARUKA]
Yu!

15
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,000
Haruka!

16
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,625
[HARUKA]
Yu...!

17
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,208
Where are we?

18
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,916
We're in an underground city...

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,041
A what?

20
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,458
It's called "La'cryma."

21
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,041
[YU]
I don't understand.

22
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,083
It's fifteen years
in the future.

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,250
Fifteen years?!

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,125
[ATORI laughing]

25
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,750
Where'd they disappear to?

26
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,500
What? Atori, are you alright?

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,041
But... they're gone!

28
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,708
That's impossible!

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,583
It's La'cryma! They were
both teleported there!

30
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,125
[KARASU]
Why didn't you prevent it?!

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,041
I'm sorry!

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,708
Send me to La'cryma right now!

33
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,500
It can't be done, Karasu!

34
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,916
I don't have enough
equipment with me

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,916
to construct a
transportation system!

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,333
[ATORI]
Knock it off.

37
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,583
This is not the time
for an argument.

38
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,583
Atori...

39
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,750
You're yourself again.

40
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,583
Come on, Tobi, think.

41
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,958
What are you saying?

42
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,000
If any person can
do it, it's you.

43
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,958
I know you can bring back
those annoying brats.

44
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
[KOORIYAMA]
Looks like everything's okay.

45
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,833
[UCHIDA] Yes, but I felt
a powerful dimensional bend.

46
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,958
You saw that light, didn't you?

47
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,541
I guess I did.

48
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,916
[UCHIDA]
Somethin' has happened.

49
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,500
[KOORIYAMA]
Huh?

50
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,916
[TOBI] Oh. Hello, Ms. Uchida.
What perfect timing.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,291
I was just about to go
out looking for you.

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,416
Oh?

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,250
[TORI] Let me ask; you own
a quantum computer, right?

54
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,000
[UCHIDA] That machine
is still only a prototype.

55
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,166
Will it be okay?

56
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,708
[TORI] It's better than
the Noiman model.

57
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,500
[YU]
What is this place?

58
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,875
Why are they living
underground like this?

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,083
[HARUKA] I don't think they
can live on the surface.

60
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,375
But how? Why? What exactly
happens to us in the future?

61
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,250
[HARUKA]
I'm not really sure.

62
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,375
But something really
terrible happened then.

63
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,208
From what I know,
they were being attacked

64
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,583
by these weird, flying things.
And, in order to survive,

65
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,041
they decided to leave the
surface and move underground.

66
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,833
Who told that to you? That
doesn't make any sense at all.

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,208
[YU]
Then again...

68
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,458
Who would've imagined that
this would be our future?

69
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,083
I've been told that this
isn't our only future.

70
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,083
Huh?

71
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,333
They said we have many futures

72
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
and this is just
one possibility.

73
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,083
What are you talking about?
Is this our future or not?

74
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,875
It's difficult to understand,

75
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,333
but there are
countless dimensions

76
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,250
which co-exist in every
second of our time.

77
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,166
So that's why this is one
of many possible futures.

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,125
[YU] So there're...
many possible futures?

79
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,791
That's what Ai told me.

80
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,041
Huh? Why would
she tell you that?

81
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,750
I mean the Ai of this world.

82
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
Of this world?!

83
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,583
[LILY]
Hey, you're here again?!

84
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,416
And you got a man with you.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,625
Lily!

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,166
It's a mini-Miho!

87
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,041
[LILY]
I'm Lily! Miho's my mom!

88
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:01,916
[YU]
Oh.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're kind of... dumb.

90
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,416
I mean, seriously, don't you
know the Dragon Soldiers

91
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
are all out looking for you?

92
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,833
I know that, but I didn't
have a choice in the matter.

93
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,416
I was brought here somehow.

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,208
Jeez, you sound like it's
no big deal. Well, it is!

95
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,291
Ugh! They'll catch you!
Yes, they will!

96
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,625
They'll try to put me
in that fish tank again!

97
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,583
I got it! Yes!
Let's go to Auntie's!

98
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,750
[BOTH]
Who's "Auntie"?

99
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,375
Haruka! But I don't--

100
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,958
What happened, what's going on?!

101
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,458
I'm not entirely sure.

102
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,875
I don't understand,
it's unbelievable...

103
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,333
Yu?!

104
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,666
That is your name, isn't it?

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,125
Uh, yes, ma'am.

106
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,708
[AMAMIKU]
It's been ages...

107
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,041
You're still 12
years old, right?

108
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,416
I am.

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,541
I don't think this is really
Ai; she's way too nice.

110
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,291
[AMAMIKU]
Quickly. Let's get you inside.

111
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,291
You don't want to be spotted
by the Dragon Soldiers.

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,666
[LILY]
Hurry! Hurry!

113
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,625
[MIHO]
Wow, this is totally amazing!

114
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,208
[ISAMI]
You really think this'll work?

115
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,750
[AI]
They can hear you!

116
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,583
Karasu, stand right below it.

117
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,666
How's this?

118
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,625
Stay still for a minute.

119
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,208
Looks like we're ready to go.

120
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,916
[ISAMI] I still don't
think it's got a chance.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,208
Now. Activate.

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,500
[ATORI]
Is it working?

123
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,708
It's no good.

124
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,083
What's wrong?

125
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,458
There's not enough power.

126
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,291
Get some!

127
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,625
Don't stop, try it again!

128
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,625
Why isn't it working?

129
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,250
Kosagi.

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,500
[KOSAGI]
Use this.

131
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,041
What?

132
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,666
A storage battery.

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,875
Hey, where did you
get this thing?

134
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,041
[KOSAGI]
Kuina gave it to me.

135
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,416
Kosagi...

136
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,791
I'm certain I won't
be needing it.

137
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,208
Be sure they both
come back, Karasu.

138
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,125
[AMAMIKU] They performed a
fixed-reverse calculation

139
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,208
on your location.

140
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,541
[YU]
I think I remember Tobi

141
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,166
saying something
along those lines.

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,333
[HARUKA]
Oh, great, more confusing stuff.

143
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,166
It doesn't matter
how you got here,

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,750
we just have to find a way
to get you both home.

145
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,791
Where's Karasu?

146
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,291
It's up to me to
protect Haruka now.

147
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,000
I made a deal about
it with Karasu.

148
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, I see. It's imperative
that you keep her safe.

149
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,750
Yu, thanks.

150
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,833
Hang on. We're going to
have to go to that room

151
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,500
so we can get back, won't we?

152
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,833
[YU]
The room we landed in?

153
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
[AMAMIKU] That sounds like
the transporter room.

154
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,250
[YU] Then we should
go now, so we can--

155
00:08:55,333 --> 00:09:00,041
[YU grunting]

156
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,916
Hey, I brought
food for everyone!

157
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,833
[HARUKA]
Yu!

158
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,208
[AMAMIKU]
What's wrong?!

159
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,791
I'll be okay...

160
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,791
[HARUKA]
Oh no!

161
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,958
Don't try to stand!

162
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,083
What's going on?

163
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,125
I feel so...
so weak and used up.

164
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,750
[HARUKA]
It's okay. Hang on.

165
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,375
[LILY] Oh no, why is
he glowing like that?

166
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,708
[HARUKA]
Please, no.

167
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,500
Haruka! Go outside, now!

168
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,416
[HARUKA]
Huh?

169
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,458
[AMAMIKU]
Hurry!

170
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,958
[HARUKA]
Why?! I wanna stay here! No!

171
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,708
[AMAMIKU] This isn't
something you should see!

172
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,958
Get back here!

173
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,916
He's not breathing!

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,333
[HARUKA]
Yu!

175
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,000
[OPERATOR]
What is this?

176
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,416
[OPERATOR]
It can't be...

177
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,666
Haruka!

178
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,291
[HARUKA] Let go! Why won't
you let me inside?

179
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,208
[AMAMIKU] You need to
calm down... and listen to me!

180
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,250
[AMAMIKU]
Stop it!

181
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,041
Well, you're a pretty tough
girl, aren't you, Haruka?

182
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,958
[HARUKA]
Ai...

183
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,875
Just listen to me.

184
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,666
In our reality where the quantum
revolution has occurred,

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,500
all matter has lapsed
into a quantum state.

186
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,958
It is a world where the
existence of all dimensions

187
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,791
can not be established including
that of humanity itself.

188
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:44,375
[AMAMIKU] We are an unstable
existence, without an observer.

189
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,416
"Observer"?

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
So we stabilized this world

191
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,291
by transforming
everything into data.

192
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,458
We call this descriptive data
"Reizu" and it is stored inside

193
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,666
a massive quantum computer.

194
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,958
We named this world "La'cryma".

195
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,750
In other words, things
without a data description

196
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,625
cannot exist here.

197
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,000
That's why Yu is disappearing.

198
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,166
Then why isn't it
happening to me?!

199
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,083
Because you are a special case.

200
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,875
You were recorded in memory
the last time you came.

201
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,666
Can't be...

202
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,291
[AMAMIKU] Alright now, listen
to me, this is very important.

203
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,833
I know that it must
seem like Yu is dead.

204
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,291
But as long as his
existence remains unstable,

205
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,791
in the larger picture, his death
here is only theoretical.

206
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,416
I don't understand
what you're saying.

207
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,375
It's quite simply an
overlapping temporal state

208
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:47,125
of dimensions where he's dead,
and dimensions where he's alive.

209
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,625
[HARUKA]
So he's dead... and alive?

210
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,333
[AMAMIKU]
Yes.

211
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,583
[HARUKA] So he's alive
in a different world.

212
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,833
That's right.

213
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,541
And that's why you
must not look at him now.

214
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,750
Since you're the Dragon Torque,
you may very well have the power

215
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:04,083
to finalize
whatever you observe.

216
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,916
[AMAMIKU] If you witness
him in a state of death now,

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,333
his death will
become a reality.

218
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,916
[HARUKA]
That... just can't be...

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,208
[AMAMIKU] However, if you can
witness him in a living state,

220
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,708
and both of you can recognize
each other's existences,

221
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,458
he will be reestablished
into a living state.

222
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,916
I'm sure of it.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,375
Fine, then what dimension
is he alive in right now?

224
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,875
[AMAMIKU]
I don't know.

225
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,208
[KUINA]
He's in Shangri-la.

226
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,041
[YU]
Haruka...

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,291
[YU]
What is this place?

228
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
Where the heck am I?

229
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,541
This isn't Heaven is it?

230
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,041
[YU]
Not again...

231
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:13,958
[NOEIN cackles] I never thought
you would come to this land.

232
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,208
That means even I wasn't
able to fully predict

233
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,083
the will of this dimension.

234
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,583
He's in Shangri-la?!

235
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,166
[AMAMIKU]
No, don't!

236
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,166
[KUINA] You want to save him?
Then come with me to Shangri-la!

237
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,833
Shangri-la?

238
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,625
Kuina! Why have you
betrayed La'cryma?!

239
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,291
[KUINA]
Hah! You have no right to speak

240
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,791
after aiding the
Dragon Torque's escape!

241
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,375
Now move!

242
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,666
Or are you going to help
Karasu, who killed Fukurou?

243
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,666
Liar! It wasn't him!

244
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,416
Please believe me.
It wasn't him.

245
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,791
He and Isami-- they were
best friends to the very end.

246
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,500
And Isami said he missed you.

247
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,791
He said that?

248
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,625
Karasu didn't kill him,
Noein did!

249
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,875
That's why I can't stand
Shangri-la! I hate it!

250
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,750
[HARUKA]
But...

251
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,541
Karasu!

252
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,500
Kuina! You will never have her!

253
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,916
[KUINA]
I've had enough of you!

254
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,916
[HARUKA] Please don't!
Yu is alive in Shangri-la,

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,083
and I have to go there
to save him, now!

256
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,000
I have to go!
Or else he's gonna die!

257
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,583
He's what?!

258
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:04,958
[LILY]
Auntie!

259
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,166
[AMAMIKU]
Lily!

260
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,000
[LILY]
Oh no! It's a monster!

261
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,625
[KUINA]
La'cryma is about to disappear.

262
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,958
It was just another
weak dimension.

263
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,666
Shangri-la isn't the only cause

264
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,250
for the dimensional
assimilation.

265
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
This is fate!

266
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:37,083
Those who are deemed unnecessary
are destined to disappear!

267
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,958
Karasu, you agree
with me, don't you?!

268
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,125
Born in this dimension,
have you ever once

269
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,166
felt the satisfaction
of existence?!

270
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,625
Nothing but pain and suffering!

271
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,125
Don't you know
that this dimension

272
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,916
is meant only to bring
misery for those

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,791
who exist in it?

274
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:59,000
And that is why only
Shangri-la can save me!

275
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,125
As long as I have
the Dragon Torque,

276
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,500
I will be accepted
into Shangri-la!

277
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,625
To a dimension
filled with happiness

278
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,875
where there's no suffering!

279
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,916
[YU]
Where am I?

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,916
[NOEIN]
This place is Shangri-la.

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,750
The blissful future that
the people wished for.

282
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,458
[YU] What people wished
for this? Where is everyone?

283
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,000
[NOEIN]
They have no form.

284
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,291
This is a world where
only consciousness exists.

285
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,125
Consciousness?

286
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,041
Haruka!

287
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,875
[HARUKA]
No, don't!

288
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,208
If I don't go, he's gonna die.

289
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,083
It's okay, Karasu,
I promise I'll save him.

290
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,500
[KUINA] Noein!
Accept me into Shangri-la!

291
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,041
[AMAMIKU]
Haruka!

292
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,208
[AMAMIKU]
Haruka!

293
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,958
That's the guy who
helped me and Isami.

294
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:38,083
[NOEIN] Yes, you are right.
You've met him once.

295
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:42,250
This is what Isami looks
like in fifteen years.

296
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,583
That's Isami?!

297
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,333
[NOEIN] But are you aware
that Isami was murdered?

298
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,333
And who was the culprit?
It was you!

299
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,958
You killed him.
You'll be killing him

300
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,583
fifteen years into the future!

301
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,541
[YU] Fifteen years in
the future? Karasu, you mean!

302
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,791
[NOEIN]
No, not him. It was me.

303
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,833
Because I am you.

304
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,916
In your future, you will
kill your best friend.

305
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,916
Not true! That's a lie! A lieee!

306
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,041
[KUINA laughs]
We have arrived!

307
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,666
The eternal Shangri-la!

308
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,291
This is it?

309
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,250
Why?!

310
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:42,333
This dimension...
Shangri-la is rejecting me!

311
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,791
[KUINA]
No! Aaah!

312
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,791
Karasu!

313
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,208
[KUINA] You're definitely
the man I made you out to be.

314
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,166
I knew you would make
a good Dragon Soldier.

315
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,583
So my judgment was
correct after all.

316
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,291
And now look at me.
This is what I get

317
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,041
for wishing for Shangri-la.

318
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,416
[KUINA] Laugh, Karasu!
Look at what a fool I am!

319
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,625
[KUINA laughing]

320
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,875
He's falling apart.

321
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,833
[YU screams]

322
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
Yu!

323
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,333
He's calling out to me!

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,083
[HARUKA]
He's in there.

325
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,666
[KARASU]
Hold on tight.

326
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,333
[KARASU yells]

327
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,208
Go!

328
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,458
[NOEIN] You will live
with infinite sorrow.

329
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,875
Now and forever until you die.

330
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,333
That is your dimension.

331
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,208
Yu! Karasu, hurry!

332
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,083
[NOEIN]
Huh? What?!

333
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:53,833
Hey!

334
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,166
Haruka!

335
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,583
[KARASU]
Dammit!

336
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,916
[NOEIN]
Get out of my way!

337
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,541
[HARUKA]
No, don't!

338
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,333
No!

339
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,166
Yu!

340
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,958
[HARUKA]
Hang in there!

341
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,875
Please, you gotta!

342
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,500
What?

343
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,208
No, no, what's going on?!

344
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,916
Karasu, where are you?!

345
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,083
[HARUKA]
He's disappearing! Help me!

346
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,875
Please don't go... Stay here...

347
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,291
Don't disappear!

348
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,833
Don't go...

349
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,666
[LILY]
He's disappearing!

350
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,458
Haruka... please let it
be that you found him.

351
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,125
[YU]
Haruka...

352
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,500
[HARUKA]
Huh?

353
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,666
Yu!

354
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,208
Give a guy a chance
to breath, will ya?

355
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,125
[HARUKA]
Thank Heaven!

356
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,125
Hey!

357
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,125
[HARUKA]
You're really here!

358
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,583
Okay, stop hugging me!

359
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,083
[HARUKA]
I'm just so happy!

360
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,458
[YU]
C'mon, let go of me already.

361
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,375
[HARUKA]
I'm dreaming again...

362
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,166
That summer day's dream.

363
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,041
[TOBI]
Shangri-la is unstable.

364
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,875
There is a risk that
Haruka will disappear.

365
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,916
[ATORI]
Let's get moving here, shall we?

366
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,041
[NOEIN] You have made
the correct choice.

367
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:22,916
[HARUKA]
Next episode: "Illusion."

368
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,041
Will you be able to find it?
