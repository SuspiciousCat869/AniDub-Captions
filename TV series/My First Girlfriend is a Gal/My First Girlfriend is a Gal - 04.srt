[STUDENT A]
Wow, Yui!

00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,125
You're, like, really
smart, you know that?

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,083
Like, inventor of the
fidget spinner smart!

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,625
You're too kind.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,583
[STUDENT B] And you're so cute,
you could stop traffic,

00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,500
causing a disemboweling
three-car pileup!

You're very sweet.

'Scuse me, Yui?

Did you drop this?

Huh? Oh, ya.

Hey, guys. Junichi Hashiba here.

17
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,625
You've caught me in the middle

18
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:33,000
of my ongoing
research into "gals."

19
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,333
Ugh, this old fart on the
train today asked me

20
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,291
if I would move my bag
so he could sit down.

21
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,833
Ugh, I'm glad he had a stroke!

22
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,625
[JUNICHI]
See, for a variety of reasons,

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,666
I've been interacting with
a lot of "gals" lately.

24
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,541
For real, though, you can't
just leave a person on "read."

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,875
That kinda thing should
be illegal, am I right?

26
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,833
So I'm just clicking
around the interwebs,

27
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,125
looking to see what kind of
gals are out there in the world,

28
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,666
you know, aside from
just Yukana and Ranko.

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,875
Like Jane Goodall with the apes.

30
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,916
Huh? You wanna know my bra size?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,333
Thirty-six double-deez nuts,
that's my bra size, fool!

32
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,166
[JUNICHI] This is purely
for education purposes,

33
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,625
so I can better understand
Yukana and Ranko.

34
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,791
I can't go further than this.

35
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,083
I'll get in trouble. And
then I'll need a spanking.

36
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,000
[JUNICHI]
I'm doing this all for Yukana!

It's not like I wanna be looking
at boobs on the Internet!

Hi, welcome to Bwaht Channel.

Hey there, how's
everybody doing tonight?

00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,708
Your favorite mistress
is doing dandy.

41
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,458
Now, most of my servants
are doing a pretty good job.

42
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,083
But there's this one individual

who's getting a
bit too arrogant.

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,666
I think I may even have to
punish this little troublemaker.

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,833
What do you guys think of that?

were you, Mister Virgin?

that while you're eating.

the other day with Ranko,

I bet she's still
plotting something.

plotting something.

of that fact and still did it.

158
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,458
So, don't be sorry,
bitch, be gone!

159
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,583
[JUNICHI]
Uh, Ranko, why don't you--?

160
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,916
Now I feel bad.
I shouldn't have barged in.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,458
It's just that I needed
to talk to Junichi.

162
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,708
But it's no biggie.

163
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,625
[JUNICHI]
Uh.

164
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,083
Hold on!

165
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,041
Talk to ya later, Junichi!

166
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,666
Hey, Mister Virgin.

167
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,250
You got something going on
with that ratchet-ass bitch?

168
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,500
[JUNICHI]
No, no, no!

169
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,125
I've got nothing to do
with her! Not a thing!

170
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,291
[RANKO]
Really?

171
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,583
'Cause that Pinocchio
nose in your pants

172
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,916
says you're lying to us!

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,125
I'm a teen boy!
Those just happen!

174
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't buy it!

175
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,791
[RANKO]
She looks all innocent and pure,

176
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,666
but I've got a bad
feeling about that chick.

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,916
[YUKANA]
Huh?

178
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,125
[YUKANA]
All right, well,

179
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,291
I'm gonna hang out
with my friends now.

180
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,208
Okay. Have fun, I guess.

181
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,875
Aww.

182
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,500
You look like a sad
little puppy dog

183
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,125
just waiting for his master
to come back home.

184
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,291
No. No, I don't. Whatever.

185
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,083
[YUKANA chuckles]

186
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,291
See ya later, puppy dog!

187
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,208
Thanks for waiting, guys!

188
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,625
Ass.

189
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,125
[YUI]
Hey there, Junichi.

190
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,791
[JUNICHI screams]

191
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,375
Oh, Yui.

192
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,791
[YUI chuckles]

193
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,708
Sorry, but I didn't get to
talk to you at lunch time.

194
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,291
Oh, yeah, right. Of course.

195
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,083
So, um, what was it
that you needed me for?

196
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,708
The teacher asked me
to do him a favor

197
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,708
and pick up a few things
for the classroom,

198
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,791
but it's a lot for me to carry.

199
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,958
So I was hoping a big, strong
boy like you could help me out.

200
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,708
Uh! Wait, me?

201
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,458
[YUI]
Think you can handle it?

202
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,291
Uh, sure, if that's
all you need.

203
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,708
Aw, thanks. You're sweet.

204
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,166
[chuckles]

205
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,875
[CAFE MAN A] Oh, God.
Murry, we got kids in the door.

206
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,541
[YUI]
Thank you.

207
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,083
[JUNICHI]
Huh.

208
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,541
Weren't we supposed to be
getting school supplies?

209
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,041
What are we doing in
a cozy, dimly lit café?

210
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,125
[YUI]
Junichi.

211
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,416
Huh? Yeah, what now?

212
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,750
You want something?

213
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,916
What do you--?

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,375
Oh, right, uh, I guess
I'll get a coffee.

215
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,416
Oh, well, I'm gonna
have some tea.

216
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,875
Excuse me, sir!

217
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,208
[CAFE MAN A]
Keep your panties on...

218
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,166
[JUNICHI] Is Yui ignoring
a request from a teacher

219
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
and just slacking off instead?

220
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,875
No way. She's, like, the most
serious girl in school.

221
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,333
She would never.

222
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,666
Hmm.

223
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,250
Wait. I've heard about this.

224
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,666
[JUNICHI, SHINPEI]
There's a very specific type

225
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,000
of "serious" gal known as...

226
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,166
[SHINPEI]
...the "serious slut."

227
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,583
Slut. Slalalalut.
No slut-shaming now.

228
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,291
Now then, let's--

229
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,583
Uh. Yui?

230
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,166
What're you--? Why are
you coming over here?

231
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,666
It's never busy here.

232
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,125
This place is kind of
a hole in the wall.

233
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,791
Do you like holes in the wall?

234
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,958
Is that a question about
structural integrity?

235
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:06,791
If so then--

236
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,083
[JUNICHI chuckles nervously]

237
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,750
[JUNICHI gasps]

238
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,083
What are you--?

239
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,500
[YUI giggles]

240
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,041
By the way, the owner stepped
out to run some errands,

241
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,416
so no matter how loud
the two of us get,

242
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,291
nobody's gonna throw
cold water on us.

243
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,875
We can't do this.
I can't do this.

244
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,041
Not right here in
the middle of a café.

245
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,708
I'll just show myself out.

246
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,041
[JUNICHI] Why does every girl
keep doing this to--?

247
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,458
Hey-oh!

248
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,166
[JUNICHI]
Yep, could happen.

249
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,833
[CAFE MAN A] All right. Here's
your coffee, prince charming.

250
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,458
I hate my life.

251
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,000
So, Junichi. There's
something I wanted to ask you.

252
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,291
Uh. Sure. Go ahead.

253
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,416
Right, well, it's about Yukana.

254
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,750
Seems you've gotten pretty
close to her lately.

255
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,500
[JUNICHI]
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

256
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,458
Are you two, like,
dating or something?

257
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,708
[JUNICHI] To be honest,
I'm not really sure.

258
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,916
I mean, I guess, technically
we are, kinda, but...

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,958
I see. Huh. Gotta say,
that surprises me.

260
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,375
I really didn't expect you to
go for a girl like Yukana Yame.

261
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,375
For whatever reason,
I had it in my mind

262
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,416
that a sweet, mature,
serious girl would be

263
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,291
your perfect match, huh.

264
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,333
[JUNICHI] Yeah, I'm pretty
surprised myself, actually.

265
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,291
But Yukana's got a lot
of great qualities.

266
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,541
And the more time
I spend with her,

267
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,125
the more I'm learning
about who she really is.

268
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,750
[BOA]
Ugh, it just pisses me off!

269
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,416
I mean, can you
believe this crap?

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,791
Why is my servant dog
wagging his little tail

271
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,166
for some other rando chick?

272
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,583
Seriously!

273
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,416
And then he takes one look
at me and goes all frigid,

274
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,958
when he's just this
pathetic virgin!

275
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,375
I cannot believe this dirty
dog would dare to go out

276
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,791
with some raggedy-ass
girl who's not me!

277
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,083
And to top it all off,
the other boys in his crew

278
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,041
are trying to scoop
up his leftovers.

279
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,041
How can I just let this crap go?

280
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
My so-called "royal guard,"
this four-eyed freak,

281
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,958
some blonde moron, and a
total greasy pedophile.

282
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250
They're not even close to loyal!

283
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,166
So, like, what's the point even?

284
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,541
Aw, I knew you guys would
totally have my back.

285
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,583
Thanks so much!

286
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,208
And I hope Mistress
Boa can continue

287
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,291
to count on your support!

288
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,000
It means the world to me!

289
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,250
[SHINPEI]
Print!

290
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,250
For real though?

291
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,833
[AYUMI]
Yeah, totes for real.

292
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,750
[BOTH laugh]

293
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,625
[YUKANA]
Hm? Oh. Hey, Junic--

294
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,916
Hey there, stud!

295
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,666
Where'd you come from?

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,916
So thanks for last night.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,208
What the hell?

298
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,791
[AYUMI]
What's wrong, Yukacchi?

299
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,083
You really did.

300
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,041
I felt so much better
having your shoulder

301
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,458
to lean on, Junichi.

302
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,208
You're a great listener.

303
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,833
Huh, if you say so.

304
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,208
[JUNICHI chuckles]

305
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,208
[JUNICHI]
Glad I could be of service.

306
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,458
[SHINPEI]
Don't try this at home.

307
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,791
[KEIGO] What'd you wanna
talk to us about?

308
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,291
[MINORU] Yeah, why'd
you drag us back here?

309
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,458
Must be something pretty sketch

310
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,791
if you don't want
anyone else to hear.

311
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,916
[SHINPEI] Yeah, you bet
your sweet pippy it is.

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,708
I'll get the "free candy" van.

313
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Castrate yourself.

314
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,291
Here, guys, look
what old Shinny found.

315
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,625
[KEIGO] That's the cam girl
from yesterday, right?

316
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,375
The super cute one that you
claimed to have met before.

317
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,375
So do you remember
where you met her?

318
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,000
Do you actually know that girl?

319
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,375
[SHINPEI]
Oh yeah, sure do.

320
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,083
Really? You've gotta
introduce us--

321
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,833
[SHINPEI]
Can't do that, dude.

322
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,000
[KEIGO] Come on, dude!
Don't pull a Charlie Bravo.

323
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,416
No, it's not like that.

324
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,625
See, I can't introduce you
to the girl because, well,

325
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,458
she's somebody that
you already know.

326
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,375
What?

327
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,250
[SHINPEI]
Here's the proof.

328
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,666
[KEIGO] Holy crap, it's Yui?
But she's not that kinda girl!

329
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,916
[SHINPEI] It's hard to tell with
all the hair and makeup,

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,416
but look closer.

331
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,875
[KEIGO]
No freakin' way.

332
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,750
It's a complete match.

333
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,125
[SHINPEI] And if you nut bags
had any lingering doubts...

334
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,541
[BOA]
My so-called "royal guard,"

335
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,500
this four-eyed freak,
some blonde moron,

336
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,041
and a total greasy pedophile.

337
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,333
They're not even close to loyal!

338
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,916
So, like, what's the point even?

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,750
Is she talking about--?

340
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,333
Wait, I'm the pedo?

341
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,958
[SHINPEI]
"Candy van," seriously?

342
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,750
Anyway, we can't dismiss
it. There's no doubt.

343
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,750
The super cute girl is...

344
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,833
[RANKO laughs]

345
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,833
[RANKO] Interesting theory
you've got there, boys.

346
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,000
Tell me more.

347
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,291
[GUYS]
Ranko Honjou?!

348
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,666
Let's bounce, Yukacchi.

349
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,375
[YUKANA]
Uh. Oh, sure.

350
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,625
[YUI]
Hey, Junichi.

351
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,875
Oh, hey there, Yui.

352
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,291
Come on, let's blow
this popsicle stand.

353
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,666
[YUKANA]
Right, sorry! Coming!

354
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,833
So, what? Does the teacher
need our help again today?

355
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,750
Uh-uh.

356
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,083
This time I have a personal
favor to ask of you.

357
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,833
[JUNICHI]
Uhh...

358
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,208
[YUI]
Do you mind?

359
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,916
No, I guess not.

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,125
Uh, you're touching--

361
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,333
Come with me.

362
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,250
[JUNICHI gasps]

363
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,541
With you where?

364
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,375
[YUI]
Somewhere a bit more private.

365
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,291
[gasping]

366
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,708
[JUNICHI]
Well, this is private.

367
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,708
[YUI] Normally, students
aren't allowed up here,

368
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:13,875
but I got permission, so don't
worry about getting in trouble.

369
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,666
So what was that favor
you wanted to ask me for?

370
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,958
Yui, what's--?

371
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,291
[YUI]
I just can't take it anymore.

372
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,541
Huh?

373
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,416
[YUI] And you know,
it's all your fault.

374
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,458
What the--? It's my fault?!

375
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,000
[YUI] Because every time
I start to think about you,

376
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,916
it drives me crazy.

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,666
When I spend my entire lunch
period just staring at you

378
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,291
while you talk with
all of your friends.

379
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,333
When we're running
errands for the teacher.

380
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,333
And... even right now.

381
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,416
[screams]

382
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,291
[JUNICHI]
What the hell is going on?

383
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,625
Is Yui trying to say that
she's crushing on me?

384
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,625
That she's in love with me?

385
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,916
No, no, no, no, no!
That can't be true!

386
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,750
But bringing me up
here like this,

387
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,125
and the way she's been
talking, is it possible?

388
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,958
This is hard to say,
but here goes.

389
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,458
I-I like you.

390
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,458
Like a lot.

391
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,541
And, well, I was kinda hoping
you'd go out with me.

392
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,375
Really? You want me?

393
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,833
[YUI] Of course, I'd want you
to break up with Yukana first.

394
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,791
I want you to break up with her,
so you can go out with me.

395
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,541
I want you. I want you to
be mine, and mine alone!

396
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,833
[JUNICHI]
Yeah, but...

397
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,416
The thing is...

398
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,583
...I really like Yukana.

399
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,541
Aw, you like me?

400
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,416
[JUNICHI]
I'm sorry! Really, I am!

401
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,916
And I can't even begin
to tell you how shocked

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,458
and unbelievably ecstatic
I am that a girl

403
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,375
as ridiculously as cute as you
would ever ask me out, but--

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,458
I can't.

405
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,833
[YUI]
You're just a dog.

406
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,625
[JUNICHI]
Eh?

407
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,541
[YUI growls]

408
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,208
You're a flea-bitten, butt
sniffing, ball-sack-licking dog!

409
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,750
Why won't you obey me and
do what I tell you to do?

410
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,083
You're just a dog!

411
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,791
I don't like this shit!
I don't like this one bit!

412
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,125
[screams]

413
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,875
[JUNICHI]
Uh... What now?

414
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
All I ask is that you pay
attention to me, doggy!

415
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,416
I'm your damn master, doggy!

416
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm your frickin owner, doggy!

417
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,791
You can't just go around
wagging your stupid tail

418
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,291
for every bitch you see!

419
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,541
[laughs]

420
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,916
[JUNICHI]
Woof.

421
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,833
Okay. So, um...

422
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,250
[JUNICHI]
"Doggy"?

423
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,416
Why do these girls keep
comparing me to a freaking dog?

424
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,125
I know how to make you
listen to me, doggy,

425
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,041
if you're just gonna keep
on being disobedient

426
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,625
and pissing all over my carpet!

427
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,750
Huh?

428
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,250
With this!

429
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,166
[JUNICHI]
Uh. Hey, that's--!

430
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,416
[YUI laughs]

431
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,791
[YUI] Bingo! It's from
our date at the café.

432
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,416
I was recording us
the whole time!

433
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
[YUI]
Don't try this at home.

434
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,166
Aw, maybe I should just
show this to Yukana.

435
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,625
What do you think about that?

436
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,083
Huh? Think she'll like it?

437
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,500
Hey, no, wait! Please
don't show her that, Yui!

438
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,791
All right, well, then just
go out with me. Okay?

439
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,541
If you do, I'll delete the file.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,750
[JUNICHI] Damn it!
Either way, I'm screwed!

441
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,958
[RANKO]
Hold it right there!

442
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,375
[JUNICHI]
Ranko? And the action pervs?

443
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,791
[ALL]
Super Friends!

444
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,125
[JUNICHI] Hey, guys, be careful!
You're really high up!

445
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,458
[thudding]

446
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,250
We just heard everything.

447
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,416
Awfully arrogant for a girl

448
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,708
who still rocks a training
bra, aren't you?

449
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,291
'Scuse me? What is wrong
with you people?

450
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,333
This isn't your beeswax,
so buzz off!

451
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,208
Now, now, no need
to get testy.

452
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
We just wanna join in the fun.

453
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,041
You have got to be kidding me.

454
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,666
Y'know, I have permission
to be up here,

455
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,916
but otherwise, the
roof is off-limits.

456
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,875
So piss off, ho!

457
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,458
What the eff?

458
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,791
Aw, calm down, girlie.

459
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,458
All I want is to be part
of your "royal guard."

460
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,958
[gasps]

461
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,875
Mistress Boa.

462
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,416
[yelps]

463
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,916
Where did you hear that name?

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,458
Who knows?

465
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,000
This isn't over, ho-bag.
I will destroy you.

466
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,916
Heh.

467
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,166
Fine.

468
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,666
Take it.

469
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,708
How much do you three know?

470
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,583
We're well informed.

471
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,250
But you have nothing
to worry about.

472
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,250
[KEIGO]
The three of us are...

473
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,500
[MINORU]
...extremely tight-lipped.

474
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,958
What did you say?

475
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,375
Nothing you need to worry
about, Mister Virgin.

476
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,958
Okay.

477
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,458
The only thing I care about is
keeping Yukana happy, got it?

478
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,375
[YUKANA]
Junichi!

479
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,250
[JUNICHI]
Yukana!

480
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
[YUKANA]
Come on, walk me home.

481
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,833
[JUNICHI]
Huh, wasn't it just yesterday

482
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,875
she wanted to go
home without me?

483
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,750
[YUKANA]
So were you with Yui again?

484
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,083
Uh.

485
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,791
Well, she's been asking
me for help a lot lately,

486
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,541
so I was just helping her out.

487
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,291
Yeah, but that's all it was!

488
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,708
Any favors I granted were
of the non-sexual variety!

489
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,375
[YUKANA]
Yeah. I know that.

490
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,916
You're, like, totally head over
heels for me, aren't you?

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,125
So yeah, you'd have to be
a moron to cheat on this.

492
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,625
You're amazing!

493
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,416
[YUI]
Stupid sprayed-on tan bitch!

494
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,666
I was so close! But whatever,
I'm not giving up!

495
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,291
[STYLIST A]
Oh, girl, that color looks

496
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,166
straight-up fierce on you.

497
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,125
You'll be beating boys
off left and right.

498
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,250
[giggles]

499
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,208
[YUI] This is Bwat Channel.
I'll be your host today!

500
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,416
[AYUMI]
Hi, guys, Ayumi here!

501
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,291
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

502
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,625
[AYUMI]
You're not the host!

503
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,833
[KOKORO] Yeah, we already
don't get enough lines!

504
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,000
[YUI] You guys had a
couple of lines today.

505
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:43,750
Not as many as me--

506
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,875
[AYUMI]
Titless twat.

507
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,041
[YUI]
You two don't have 'em either!

508
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,416
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
Damn it!

509
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,625
We need the animators to
draw us bigger boobs, stat!
