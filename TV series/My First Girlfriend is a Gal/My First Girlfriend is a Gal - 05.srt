00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,833
That tickles.

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,250
[YUKANA] Junichi, I know you
boys get hard in the morning,

4
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,458
but why does this one feel
like it could cut a diamond?

5
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,583
Well, babe, I'm gonna
guess it's because

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,666
your crotch is grinding on me?

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,541
Yep, that's why.

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,125
So you... like it?

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,875
I-I must touch your boobies!

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,750
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,416
[screams]

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,083
Hey!

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,583
[screams]

14
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,250
[NENE]
What?

15
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,125
[JUNICHI] Calm down, Junichi.
Try to understand.

16
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,375
You woke up in the dark
to find a mysterious girl,

17
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,291
whose face you can't see,

18
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,333
but whose giant boobs you can
definitely feel and-- Oh, God.

19
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,791
Rockets on deck!

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,416
[JUNICHI yelling]

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,291
Seriously, who are you?

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,666
And what're you doing
breaking into my room?

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,166
[NENE coughs]

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,375
Yeah, so. It's all like--

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,041
Like, you're my bae.

26
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,750
But I get the vibe that
I'm not your bae, Junichi.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,500
I'm just some ho.

28
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,083
I'm not totally butt-hurt,
but I'm partially butt-hurt.

29
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,791
I'm, like, butt sore.

30
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,583
[JUNICHI] I don't have the
faintest idea what the hell

31
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,750
this girl's talking about!

32
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,416
What?

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,166
All that talk and you still
can't figure out who I am?

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,041
Forget being butt-hurt, you've
made me hella-pissed off!

35
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,708
And that's, like, way worse!

36
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,791
[JUNICHI] Yeah, no. I still
don't know who you are.

37
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,125
What? You really don't recognize
me, even in the light?

38
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,708
Fine.

39
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,083
Hey.

40
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,208
After causing all that drama,
you're just gonna ignore me?

41
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,916
And why should I wait for you
when I got Snaps to chat?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,750
This gal ain't got time for
a boy who won't grind!

43
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
Uh, yeah.

44
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,375
I don't know who you are,
and to be honest,

45
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,291
I'm not sure I even understand
what you're saying.

46
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,791
It's a whole lot of slang.

47
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,333
Now, do you mind?
Please get off my junk.

48
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,875
[NENE] Could it be that my
"gal-speak" still needs work?

49
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,708
No, that can't be it.

50
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,125
I've been rehearsing for
this moment all week.

51
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,958
The problem is that
Junichi just woke up

52
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,708
and isn't thinking straight.

53
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,666
I'll wait till later.
He'll come around by then.

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,916
No, you worked far too
hard to look adorable

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,791
for right here and now!

56
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,375
Junichi, it's me, Nene, you see?

57
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,041
[JUNICHI]
Hm?

58
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,166
[chuckles]

59
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,000
Ah, Nene! That's
you under there?

60
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,375
At least it makes sense, then,

61
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,250
for you to be sneaking
into my bedroom.

62
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,916
Wait, no it doesn't!

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Nene, you've changed!

64
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,541
[giggles]

65
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,750
Hey. Uh, Nene?
You mind letting go of me?

66
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,291
When we were little kids,

67
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,541
we used to walk to school
every day like this.

68
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,375
But now we're all grown
up in high school.

69
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,083
If people see me
walking arm-in-arm

70
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,041
with my childhood friend,
they'll get the wrong idea.

71
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,541
Especially the cool kids,

72
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,041
I don't want them to see
us, that'll be, awful.

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,083
[SHINPEI]
Yo!

74
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,125
[JUNICHI]
Ahh! Shit!

75
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,875
Hey, we're just walking, yeah.

76
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,625
Right, "walking."

77
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,041
Nice day. Eh, Junichi?

78
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,500
[MINORU grunts]

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What is this pretty young thing?

80
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,958
Does your-Does your
dolly have a name?

81

What the fuck is wrong with you?

82
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,916
Hey, you guys're
Junichi's buddies, right?

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,541
I saw you the other
day in class,

84
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,458
but I don't think we
had a chance to meet.

85
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,958
I'm the girl next door, Nene!

86
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,125
A lot of people think I'm
still in elementary school

87
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
because I'm so short,

88
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,291
but I'm just a year
younger than you guys.

89
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,250
Ugh. I'll pass, grandma.

90
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,791
I'm not wasting my
time on someone

91
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,208
who's already started puberty

92
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,333
and got hair in all
the wrong places.

[laughs]

94
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
Oh, Junichi, I didn't know
your friends were so funny!

95
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,166
That's Minoru.

96
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,791
He'll be going door to
door introducing himself

97
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,375
to all his neighbors soon.

He's dead inside.

Not only does that cute
gal like ya, Junichi,

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,041
your oddly proportioned
childhood friend

has begun dressing up like
the other girl you're dating

102

in a brazen attempt to
ride your piss weasel.

Why do they all like you?

104

Don't you realize how sexually
frustrated I am? Jerk!

C'mon, pal. You've got
enough poon for a lifetime.

Back up, you creeps!

109

I know it looks like I'm
dating another girl.

110
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
But just because I'm
arm-in-arm with an old friend

111
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
doesn't mean
anything's going on!

112
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,208
Yeah.

113
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,625
There's nothing
scandalous about me

114
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,583
walking to school with
Junichi like this.

115

The two of us are
just, like, y'know?

116
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,333
Really, really, really
close friends!

117
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,166
Um, please stop.

118
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,625
When you hold on
to me like that,

119
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,833
your giant boobs rub
against my forearm!

[BOTH wheeze]

00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,333
That's part of the fun!

[SHINPEI]
Ah! I gotta go home and fist it!

123
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,541
Oh, God, runnin'
with a boner hurts!

124
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,958
I better go. Enjoy grandma.

125
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,833
Uh, why do they always
freak out like that?

126
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,958
Well, like the one guy
said, they're jealous.

127

Oh, hey, Yui.

128

Good morning, Junichi Hashiba.

Oh, thanks. And a
good morning to you.

130
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,500
[JUNICHI] So many things
from the last few days

131
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,250
still don't make sense.

132
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,666
But I'm pretty sure she
asked me out, right?

133
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,416
Sorry about the other day.

I'd really love it if, well,

you don't tell anyone
about me asking you out.

136
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,416
Yeah. No problem.

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,333
I never gossip about that stuff.

keep things smooth.

Oh, good, there you are!

Today, we're also
walking home together!

It's her scent that's on him!

Well, I already told Yukana

147
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,625
I'd do something with
her after school.

with you today! It's my turn!

notice that this girl

is getting rather angry.

154
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,625
Maybe it's 'cause I
took away her chance

to be alone with you?

00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,291
Wow. I wonder if I'll look
like her when I'm that age.

160
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,000
I definitely want her hair,
but not the wrinkles.

161
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,500
Right, Junichi?

162
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,000
Settle down, Nene.
'Kay? That sounds rude!

163
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,833
I love how she
carries herself, too.

164
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,416
She's like a 30-year-old cougar
still going to high school.

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,291
It's great.

[laughs]

167
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,666
Big mistake.

168
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,916
No one has ever insulted
me as much as you

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,458
and lived to tell about it.

170
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,250
[JUNICHI] Oh no, what
have you done, Nene?

171
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,000
[STUDENT A]
Yui! Class is about to start!

172
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
'Kay, I'll be right there!

[JUNICHI groaning]

174
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,166
What a bitch. Are you okay?

175
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,958
Uh. Is every day gonna
be like this from now on?

176
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,625
[JUNICHI] I swear, if one more
girl comes up to me today,

177
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,750
I'm going to lose my mind.

178

[YUKANA]

[JUNICHI]
Huh?

00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,083
Hey, boyfriend,
you look tired A-F!

00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,750
Oh. Hey, Yukana.

182
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,500
You sound even worse than
you look. What's going on?

183
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,375
Just too many frustrating
things happening to me, lately,

184
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,416
and I don't understand why.

185
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,708
Aw. High school
drama. I feel ya.

That's it!

188
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,625
I'm gonna take you
someplace fun this weekend

189
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,916
that I guarantee will put a
smile back on that frowny face!

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,375
Yeah. Sure. Sounds great!

191
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,916
[YUKANA giggles]

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,166
Don't worry, you'll
have a blast there.

193
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
So what is this place?

194
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,958
And what, ruin the surprise?

195
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,541
You're just gonna hafta wait.

[SHINPEI]
I can't believe it!

He's got multiple girls
spreading their legs for him,

198
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,041
while we sit here
with dry dicks!

199
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,708
Too bad we can't re-load life
from an earlier save point.

200
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,791
Don't get too
worked up over him.

201
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,125
The key to being happy in life

202
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,541
is to only worry
about the things

203
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,250

204

Like for me, it's my new
cartography hobby!

205
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,791
Maps of where all the
little girls live in town,

206
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,750
complete with their
parents' work schedules.

207

Pretty cool, huh?

00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,625
My God. Hear yourself.

00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,375
I hope in the near future

210
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,750
men in uniforms come
to take you away.

211

I was more excited to
eat that pot sticker

217
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,708
than you might think.

218
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,291
It's your fault for keeping
it on the plate so long.

219
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,083
Come on, I'll give you
some of my melon bread

220
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,458
if you quit acting
all butt-hurt.

[JUNICHI]
Yeah, it's really pretty good.

Hey, talking with your
mouth full is so rude!

And now, we're even
for the pot sticker!

What? No fair!

to show her my big potsticker!

What? What are you
talking about?

When are you gonna give me
a taste of what you got?

[JUNICHI]
Oh, man.

I forgot all about Ranko
being a jealous psycho!

00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,958
Why's life so complicated?

238

[RANKO] I won't even let you
flirt with her when I'm around.

[NENE]
Junichi? Oh, there you are!

for my favorite boy-toy Junichi!

Whoa, watch it, there, Nene.

Unless it's an emergency.

How come I haven't
gotten a chance

[JUNICHI] Oh, yeah, this
day just keeps on giving!

clingy female friend to say,

"Hey, I baked you cookies!"

to get in my head

My nips are hard.

316
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,833
[JUNICHI screams]

317
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,208
[JUNICHI]
War. Why does Man fight?

318
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,000
Are there good reasons
for one nation

319
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,833
to ever wage war
against another?

320
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,333
Some might say resources,
or politics, or religion.

321
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,041
But those people
would all be stupid.

322
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,750
Because there's no
good reason to fight

323
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:56,125
so long as beauty
remains in the world.

324
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,833
[JUNICHI]
Hallelujah!

325
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,666
[JUNICHI] These three
goddesses are pressing

326
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,000
their chests against each other.

327
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,250
The sight of it alone should
be enough to rid the world

328
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,333
of all hate and conflict!

329
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,625
Boobs're great.

330
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,041
[NENE] Hold on. Are they
seriously enjoying this?

331
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,500
It's really creepy.

332
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,166
What? Why'd you stop?

333
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,916
You don't really care about
Junichi, you're just using him!

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,583
You'll kick him to the
curb as soon as you meet

335
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,250
a more experienced guy.

336
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,208
I mean, there's no
reason to date a virgin.

337
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,541
You're just messing
with his head!

338
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,333
For a cute girl, you
really twist the knife.

339
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,500
Why's that?

340
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,833
[NENE]
Why's that what?

341
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,083
Why is it you think Junichi

342
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,291
can't get a girl
to fall for him?

343
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,750
Because...

344
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,666
I've known him for years.

345
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,375
Longer than you two,

346
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,833
or any other girls at school
have, that's for sure!

347
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,416
I get that Junichi's not
exactly Mister Popularity,

348
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,958
but still, that didn't stop me

349
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,500
from wanting to
become his girlfriend.

350
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,375
There's a lotta good
things about him.

351
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,041
You know that, right?
Even better than me, I bet.

352
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,541
[NENE]
I--

353
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,583
Um, you don't have to cry.

354
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,208
Kiss my eye, you big dummies!

355
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,541
Have you ever been called
a "dummy" before?

356
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,208
She's cute. So it's fine.

357
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,416
Poor Nene. Now what?

358
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,291
[YUI] I'm sorry for not being
my normal, playful self, guys,

359
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,708
but I had a bad day.

360
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,791
Let's just say...

361
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,083
Nene's a gal. It's so strange.

362
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,958
I better learn more
about how gals think

363
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,708
before I get blindsided again.

Don't forget to click on
the link below and donate!

365
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,458
Anyway, this stupid,
monster-boobed underclassman

366
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,750
made a crack about
me looking old.

367
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,708
"A monster-boobed
underclassman"?

368
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,083
Oh, boy.

369
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,541
I haven't heard from Nene
since then. Hope she's good.

370
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,458
[JUNICHI snoring]

371
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,708
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

372
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm back.

373
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,958
Uh. Nene, is that you?

374
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,666
Oh. How ya doin'?
Been a few hours.

375
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:30,083
Whoa, holy crap, Nene!
Are you completely naked?

376
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,791
Nene, stop!

377
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,166
[JUNICHI]
They're soft and huge.

378
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:43,583
Junichi. I think it's
time that we... make love.

379
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,166
[JUNICHI wheezes]

380
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,583
You wanna have sex with me?

381
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,208
[JUNICHI] I feel every part
of her against my skin.

382
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,333
Now go turn this
half-assed gal

383
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,041
into a grown-ass woman.

384
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,875
[JUNICHI]
All right, be cool.

385
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,833
Again, it's important that you
calmly take stock of things.

386
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,125
You woke up, and for the
second night in a row,

387
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,333
your childhood friend is
naked and grinding on you!

388
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,333
How the hell am I supposed
to calmly do anything?

[LIBIDO] I'm stronger
and harder than ever!

00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,750
And I'm parking my pigskin
bus in her muffin shop!

[COOL]
Don't do anything stupid.

397
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
Listen. We grew up
alongside Nene.

398
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,083
She might as well be our sister.

[JUNICHI] You can't Charlie
Bravo the embodiment of cock!

401
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,208
Ha. You're not strong
at all, you're pathetic.

402
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,458
Drowning in your lust.

403
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,708
But there's another way.

404
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,000
A better path for all of us!

What in the hell?

00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,958
[BOTH] Wow! That's it!
The better path to love!

408
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,416
Heh.

409
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,833
I stand now above
all selfish lust!

410
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,541
[LIBIDO]
What's that you're sayin?!

411
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,000
It's over.

412
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,625
The end of your
obsession with sex.

413
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,291
You have my sympathies, though.

414
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
You wont feel a thing.

415
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,458
[LIBIDO] And I promise you
there's no part of Junichi

416
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,541
that can stop me now!

417
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,375
Oh, ballz.

00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,583
[BOTH]
Yay, go me!

419

[FUSION] Those who burn twice
as bright, burn half as long,

420
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,833
and now, old friend,
it's time I light your wick!

421
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,541
Hah!

422
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,875
[LIBIDO] No, no, stop it!
Ow! Wow, that feels great!

423
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,750
[FUSION] His was a path any
of us could've fallen on.

424
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,666
Had I been consumed
by carnal desire,

425
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,416
it would've been you
having to erase me.

426
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,708
Well, gentlemen.

427
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,708
What's our goal when
it comes to sex?

428
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,791
Oh, I know this one!

429
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,875
Of course, I know it!

430
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,500
[ALL] Yukana will be the first
woman to take our seed!

431
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,583
Sorry.

432
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,875
I can't do it.

433
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,458
But why?

434
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,916
Why's it so hard to convince
you that I love you?

435
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,625
[JUNICHI]
That's why I won't do it.

436
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,333
I don't feel the same way

437
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,041
so I'd just be taking
advantage of your feelings.

438
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,125
You're a boy,
why do you even care?

439
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,125
Junichi, I want you
as my first, so do me!

440
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,708
[JUNICHI]
Mh-mh.

441
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm sorry, no.

442
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,666
Besides, if I have sex with you,
I'd also be hurting Yukana.

443
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,875
Guess what.

444
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,208
When we're all grown up,
you're gonna be my husband!

445
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,458
Wow, you're really
thinking far out.

446
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,833
How about this?

447
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,250
If we grow up, and I'm like,

448
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,375
a huge dork who can't
get any babes,

449
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,166
then I'll marry you!

450
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,083
Nene.

451
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,750
Well, Junichi, you didn't grow
up to be a dork, after all.

452
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,041
Huh?

453
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,416
[YUKANA]
And what're you thinking about

454
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,125
on this delicious morning?

455
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,541
Ha!

456
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,166
What's up, Yukana?

457
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,666
You're still sad?

458
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,416
You used to be all funny
and now you're all not.

459
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,416
Well, if you're not gonna
tell me what's wrong,

460
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,416
I'll squeeze it out of ya!

461
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,583
[laughs]

462
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,625
Much better! I just want
you to be yourself again!

463
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,541
[JUNICHI] I think that's
her way of showing

464
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,208
she's worried about me.

465
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,791
[NENE]
Hey, move it!

466
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,625
Get away from my Junichi!

Uh, you what?

[NENE laughs]

I've decided to become an
even cooler gal than Yukana,

00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,250
so that way I can steal
you back from her!

474
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,375
[JUNICHI]
Huh?!

475
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:14,208
This is like something
out of an old cartoon!

476
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,041
That's all, folks!

477
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,208
[AYUMI]
Ayumi, checking in!

478
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,208
[KOKORO]
Kokoro, too!

479
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,541
[NENE]
Nene, three!

480
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,125
[AYUMI]
Nene, get out of here!

481
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,791
[KOKORO] We don't need
anyone else bugging us.

482
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,458
[NENE] What? I don't
understand why you're mad.

483
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,333
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
Well, we don't understand you,

484
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,958
tits on toothpicks!

485
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:57,916
[NENE] You talk a lot for
girls with small boobs.

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
[KOKORO, AYUMI scream]

487
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,041
[KOKORO] You guys, the
preview's almost done!

488
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:00,875
[AYUMI, KOKORO, NENE]
Oh, no, we didn't--
