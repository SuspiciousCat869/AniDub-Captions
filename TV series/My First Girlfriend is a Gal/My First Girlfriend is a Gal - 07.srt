[ALL]
Cheers!

00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,458
Man, I can't believe we
get to go to the beach

3
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,458
with a veritable harem of
bathing beauties on our arms!

4
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,375
Can't wait to squirt my
sunscreen all over their backs.

5
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,750
[JUNICHI] Yeah. It's gonna
be epic, for sure.

6
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,458
We'll have to plan it carefully,
down to the last detail.

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,625
The grade school girls will be
out on summer vacation, too.

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,208
I'll teach them how
to hold their breath?

9
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,291
But all that fun's
gonna cost money.

10
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,041
We may have to get part-time
jobs to save up for this.

11
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,791
Must be some other way.

12
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,333
Can't we just sell our blood
or sperm or something?

13
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,125
I should learn mouth-to-mouth
in case I get lucky

14
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,125
and one of 'em drowns.

15
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,625
Don't worry about it.

16
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,125
I have the perfect
jobs lined up for us.

17
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,791
A job at a manga shop?

18
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,791
Considering how much of a
fanboy you've been lately,

19
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,500
I figured you could handle it.

20
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,291
Put some of your ding dong
geek knowledge to good use.

All right! I can do it!

00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,916
Oh, and I'll be there,
too, co-worker.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,208

[SHINPEI] I'm just trying
to speed up your journey

[JUNICHI]
Hey, what about me?

30
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,000
Picked this one just for you.

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,291
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

32
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,083
I have to wear that?!

33
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,041
[SHINPEI] That's right,
you'll be a pretty little maid.

Look closer. You'll be
working in the kitchen.

36
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,000
Like anybody wants to see you in
fishnets and cat ears, Kissass.

37
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,875
Quit calling me that.

38
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,250
[MINORU] If one of the girls has
a small crush, what can I do?

39
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,041
[SHINPEI]
Shut the hell up!

40
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,958
So anyway, if we wanna show
the ladies a good time,

41
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,000
we're gonna have to pull
in some serious cash flow.

Yeah!

00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,833
And if I'm really lucky,

45
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,958
one of 'em might even
have a younger sister

00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,291
who's in kindergarten, too.

47
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,500
Hey. Shinpei.

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,958
Was Toranoana
always this scary?

49
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,541
Uh-uh.

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,500
Nah, usually the worst
thing about this place

51
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,833
is all the nerd B.O.

00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,958
Man, who'd'a thought a
job catering to nerds

56
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,208
would require so much
friggin' athletic ability?

57
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,000
Not to mention
it's hot as balls.

58
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,791
Well, crap, I think I threw
out my wanking shoulder.

[MINORU] Every day, you're
getting a little bit older.

It's life's greatest tragedy.

feel would, technically,

63
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,708
be a felony.

00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,875
Me?

315
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,333
[YUI]
It's the owner of the café.

316
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,833
You're shittin' me, right?

317
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,375
Hey, Yui, so what's up?

318
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,916
No, sir. Sorry about that.

319
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,041
Yes, sir. Of course, I'll take
care of it right away, sir.

320
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,041
Yes, sir. Of course.

321
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,250
Once again, I'm so sorry.

322
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,625
Yes, sir. Please don't fire me.

323
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,625
[CAFÉ MANAGER A] Book Day's
been cancelled, you guys.

324
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,708
Another win for you
SJW Millenials.

325
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,000
Tch.

326
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,416
Oh, but, boss?

327
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,166
We're still getting that bonus
you promised, aren't we?

328
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,708
Fine. Whatever.

329
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,208
That was amazing!

330
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,875
So the call from the
owner, that was all you?

331
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,583
Hashtag boss bitch!

332
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,583
Ha. Not bad for
a stuck-up bitch.

333
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,041
Wait, I'm confused.

334
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,208
[YUKANA] I'm like literally so
happy Book Girl Day got the axe.

335
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,750
There's no way I
coulda read that stuff

336
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,250
in front of a buncha randos.

337
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,458
Yeah, that guy was a tool.

338
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,458
What's wrong?
Why're you staring at me?

339
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,000
Do I have something on my face?

340
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,291
Nah, I was just thinking.

341
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
You were kinda badass today.

342
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,791
Huh? In what way?

343
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,750
Oh, just 'cause.

344
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,375
Y'know, working part-time was
actually kinda fun, though.

345
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,083
Yeah 'cept for
that mega-creeper.

346
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,708
All right, so besides
cosplay waitress,

347
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,041
what else do you wanna be?

348
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:09,958
[YUKANA]
Hmm...

349
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,416
Lemme think a sec.

350
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
I guess I wouldn't
mind being a hostess

351
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
at a bomb-ass karaoke joint.

352
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,625
[JUNICHI chuckles]

353
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh, yeah, now that sounds like
it'd be right up your alley.

354
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,791
You would make a killer
karaoke hostess.

355
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,583
Right? But I want you there
right by my side, boyfriend.

356
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,208
Wait, I have to
work there, too?

357
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,166
Duh. Well, it's not
just at work though.

358
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,500
I wanna do lots
of stuff with you.

359
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,916
Yeah, like what?

360
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,666
Let's see. Hmm...

361
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,958
Well, like hang out
together, eat together,

362
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,500
walk home together.

363
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,708
Uh, we do all of
that now, silly.

364
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,666
'Kay, what else?

365
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,333
I wanna spend Christmas
with you, birthdays, too,

366
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,291
and buy each other
matching stuff.

367
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,333
Huh? Like what kinda
matching stuff?

368
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,458
All kinds ya know.

369
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,125
Like cell phone straps.
And, y'know, like key chains.

370
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,500
We can post profile
pictures together.

371
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,833
Oh, uh. Heh. No,
it's nothing. Never mind.

372
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,291
[JUNICHI chuckles]

373
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,000
So the beach'll be fun.

374
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,208
With Shinpei and Ranko and
all the rest of 'em there,

375
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,750
there's sure to be all
kinds of hijinks, huh?

376
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,958
Hey, Junichi?

377
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,333
'Sup?

378
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,500
I know we're going to the
beach with the whole crew,

379
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,916
but we should try
to go somewhere

380
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,708
with just the two of us, too.

381
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,916
Whoa, just us two?

382
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,708
[YUKANA giggles]

383
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,208
Yeah, just us two!

384
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,458
[YUKANA]
'S everyone here?

385
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,250
[ALL]
Yeah!

386
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:36,083
Cool! Then let's go hit
the beach, you ready?

387
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,000
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

388
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,541
[JUNICHI]
Let's go!

389
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,166
[AYUMI]
Yo, Ayumi here!

390
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,583
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

391
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,791
[AYUMI] Oh, look,
the big shot protagonist

392
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,166
has come to steal
our screen time!

393
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,583
[KOKORO]
With his big swingin' dick!

394
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,791
[JUNICHI]
Sorry, I don't know what to say.

395
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,083
[AYUMI]
Then don't say anything!

396
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,166
You're eating up
our time, virgin!

397
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,375
[KOKORO]
Yeah, you virgin!

398
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,750
[JUNICHI]
Hey, you girls are mean!

399
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,041
[AYUMI]
Say, you're the protagonist.

400
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,583
Do you have any
pull around here?

401
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,083
[KOKORO] Yeah, can you
get us more screen time?

402
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,458
[JUNICHI]
I really don't like being here.

403
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,916
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
Then just leave already!

404
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,958
[JUNICHI]
This whole preview was just me

405
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:01,875
getting dragged by you two!
