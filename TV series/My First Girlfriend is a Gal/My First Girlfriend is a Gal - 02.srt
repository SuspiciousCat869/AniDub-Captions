[JUNICHI]
Man, I still can't believe it.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,791
She actually agreed
to go out with me.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,583
So, yeah. We can
go out. Boyfriend.

00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,833
[grumbles]

5
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,833
[JUNICHI] But none of
this makes any sense.

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,875
Why would a smokin' hot, popular
gal with big boobs like her

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,500
go out with a guy like me?

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,041
I mean, just from a
logical perspective!

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,125
Bet she just wanted to
make me lower my guard

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,958
so she could tell the school
I'm a pathetic, gullible loser.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,541
So jaded!

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,000
You can't just go through life
doubting everyone's intentions!

13
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,583
What good's it do to
question Yukana's motives?

14
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,416
We're supposed to be dating her
now, in case you've forgotten!

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,541
Hah. Oh, you sweet,
innocent baby.

16
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,958
Listen, okay. Gals
are terrifying entities.

17
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,083
Fundamentally,
they're just not like us.

18
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,125
They're a completely
different species.

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,458
Really?

20
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,541
That's precisely the sort
of provincial thinking

21
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,583
that's keeping us a virgin!

22

[BAD growls]

keeping us a virgin!

[CONSCIENCE]
Hey, violence isn't the answer!

25
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,583
No hitting! No hitting!

Whoosh. Twinkle!

Enough of your useless
bickering already!

31
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,250
The only thing that
matters is getting close

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,791
to that banging
gal's banging bod!

33

[YUKANA giggles]

34
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,916
[YUKANA]
It's kinda funny, isn't it?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,958
How just a second ago, we
were so focused on class,

36
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,166
and now look at us.

37
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,916
But we can't do this in here.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,250
We could get into
so much trouble!

39
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,583
[YUKANA] Aww, but getting
into trouble's fun.

40
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,916
You don't wanna be a
naughty boy with me?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,416
Naughty? Whaddaya
mean by "naughty"?

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,291
Oh, how 'bout I just show you?

[yelps]

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,416
You can decide if you
think it's naughty after.

00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,875
[JUNICHI]
Yeah, let's do that.

[JUNICHI]
Ouch.

48
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,166
[JUNICHI] Last night I
enjoyed, or pre-enjoyed,

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,916
my little wet dream, but now
I have to worry about reality.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,875
Y'know, to be honest,
it doesn't even feel like

51
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,166
I'm actually dating
Yukana in real life.

52
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,375
I mean, when I asked
her out yesterday,

53
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,041
she sure seemed to be
having fun toying with me.

54
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,375
[YUKANA] Come on, you know
you wanna see 'em, right?

55
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,166
[JUNICHI] Maybe I'm better
off just avoiding her

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,083
from here on out.

So, uh, yeah, man, we're, um,
sorry 'bout yesterday, dude.

We, uh, went a little overboard.

[JUNICHI]
Oh, yeah, almost forgot.

64
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,250
These a-holes were the ones

who forced me to ask her
out in the first place!

Anyway, what's past
is past right?

How'd it go with her?
I'm sure she was awful.

Did she knee you in
the giggle-berries?

It was bad.

72

I'm pretty sure Yukana
put me on her hit list.

73
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,833
She's gonna make it her mission

to ruin the rest of
my high school life,

and maybe beyond that!

Uh, for real?
Did not expect that.

is no friend of mine!

how effed up this situation is!

So's Yukana have
a little sister?

110
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,958
I'm not too particular,
but if she still wets the bed,

that's kind of the
sweet spot for me.

what happened to us always
being loyal friends?

longer than that.

Now, listen up, and understand.

125
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,875
To a gal, a kiss is
just like saying "hi."

126

And if she's actually in to a
guy, then whoa buddy, look out,

on that lucky bastard

Where do you even
get this stuff from?

Does that go for the
preteen set, too?

[JUNICHI]
Well, Yukana certainly is a gal.

133
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,500
And she doesn't seem
stingy with affection.

134

she was serious

Uh, ya, I sure did.

Looks like you're finally
starting to get it, Junichi.

But there's a proper
order to things,

144
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,375
and you need to set
the stage correctly

those sweet tangerine lips.

00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,166
Those who fail to do so are
not men, but rather, scum.

467
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,750
And I do not wish for us
to be scum. Do you?

468
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,833
[COOL]
Kiss. Nibble. Slip the tongue.

469
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,666
[JUNICHI]
I'm so sorry, Yukana.

470
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,208
That's the real reason
why you wanted

471
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,375
to go karaoke-ing
with me, isn't it?

472
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,958
Fine.

473
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,125
[gasps]

474
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,416
[JUNICHI] If I can't do this,
then I'm not a real man!

475
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,750
Hey.

476
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,125
You've got a nose
hair sticking out.

477
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,000
[JUNICHI]
Uh, what now?

478
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,250
[COOL screams]

479
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,458
[ALL]
Cool me!

480
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,208
'Scuse me. I'll be right back.

481
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,750
[YUKANA]
Dummy.

482
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,416
You were totally trying
to kiss me, weren't you?

483
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,916
I'm not like that. I can't just
kiss someone so easily.

484
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,583
[JUNICHI]
It's over.

485
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,791
For the rest of my life,

486
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,666
every time I even think
about making a move,

487
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,958
all that I'll hear is, "You've
got a nose hair sticking out"!

488
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,916
Curse you, nose hair!
You pointless, tickly bastard!

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,333
Oh, Yukana, please
forgive my nose

490
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,541
and every last snot-encrusted
hair inside it!

491
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,416
[YUKANA]
Hey, I had fun today.

492
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Next time, you might
even be my first choice

493
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,958
for a karaoke partner.

494
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,375
[laughs]

495
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,916
Yeah, me, too!

496
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
[YUKANA]
All right, now let's go.

497
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,416
Come on, get up.
The ground's filthy.

498
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,291
[JUNICHI]
Yeah. Okay!

499
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,750
Hey, Yukana, wait for me!

500
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,000
[YUKANA]
Well, hurry up!

501
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,958
[JUNICHI] Aww, I think
my nostril's bleeding.

502
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,416
[RANKO]
Rude.

503
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,333
[AYUMI]
Yo, Ayumi here!

504
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,916
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,333
[AYUMI] Kokoro had some trivia
last time, so now it's my turn!

506
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,583
[KOKORO]
Let's hear it!

507
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,916
[AYUMI] Do you know why
they call it "karaoke"?

508
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,041
[KOKORO]
It's from the Japanese word

509
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,416
for "empty" and
"orchestra," right?

510
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,791
So hey, what's your fun trivia?

511
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,250
[AYUMI] You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

512
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,583
[KOKORO] No, seriously,
what's your trivia?
