out to you or whatever?

161
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,166
And do you think that's really
how he feels about you?

162
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,291
Actually, I kinda
hope that it isn't.

163
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,041
Well then, you should
ask him again directly.

164
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,500
That way you'll know for sure
before you go crazy worrying.

165
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,166
Yui.

166
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,958
Both of you, thanks so much.

167
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,875
I'm not entirely
sure how I feel yet,

168
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:09,708
so I need to do some thinking,
but I will ask him again.

169
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,875
Hey, monster boobs,

170
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,875
isn't it colossally stupid
to help your love rival?

171
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,208
I could ask you the
same exact thing.

172
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,583
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Okay, I'm done.

Whoa, you guys
are really strong.

Annoying as hell, but strong.

the hell away from you guys.

Oh, you know what?

Ma-mah. Sorry.

It's not, "Please don't
hurt me, I'm begging you."

these last few months,

they've been like a dream.

got down on my hands and knees

and begged.

out, and she hadn't said yes,

The first time I did this,

giving it much thought.

any feelings for you,

that sweet, sweet ass.

I know, I hate myself
right now, too.

But... that's changed.

I'm in love with
you now, Yukana.

And I really don't want to.

wanted to do it right.

wanna go. With you.

00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,958
[JUNICHI]
It's super-cute!

318
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,250
And sexy as hell!

319
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,708
I think that it's perfect.
Y'know, for your body type.

320
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,750
Well, that's a decent enough
answer coming from you,

321
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,541
so I guess you pass, barely.

322
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,250
[JUNICHI chuckles]

323
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,791
So I just barely pass, huh?
You're a tough grader.

324
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,083
[YUKANA giggles]

325
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,583
Let's go!

326
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,416
An amusement park?

327
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,416
Remember? Huh? The beach?

328
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,583
You said you wanted to go to
an amusement park at night?

329
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,500
[JUNICHI]
Huh.

330
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,583
Yeah. I said that, huh?

331
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
[laughs]

332
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,125
[giggles]

333
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
Of course!

334
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,583
[JUNICHI] This is incredible!
She's so darn sweet!

335
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,291
How did I ever get so lucky?

336
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,583
I just wanna scream to the
world that she's my girlfriend

337
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,875
and I love her!

338
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,333
Can't wait to go on rides
with my ride-or-die!

339
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,375
[JUNICHI] Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

340
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,000
[YUKANA yells, laughs]

341
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,875
[YUKANA]
Come on, scaredy-cat.

342
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,583
[JUNICHI]
No, it's okay, I'm good.

343
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
I'll wait for you outside.

344
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,875
[ROBOT A]
Welcome to Hell, mortal.

345
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,916
That bitch got you good!

346
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,083
[JUNICHI]
Now this ride's more my spee--!

347
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,375
[JUNICHI sighs]

348
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,458
Someone's been
having too much fun.

349
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,875
Here.

350
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,375
Oh, thank you.

351
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,708
It's been so long since my last
time at an amusement park,

352
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,833
it all just feels so new again.

353
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,000
This is kinda nice, isn't it?

354
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,833
Almost feels like
an actual date.

355
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,291
Yeah. You're right.

356
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,083
Hey, Junichi. Come with me!

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,041
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

358
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,041
Ah! I knew they'd have one!

359
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,166
Look, Junichi, a photo booth!

360
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,416
'Kay.

361
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,333
[TEEN GIRL A]
Ooh, baby, I want the big one!

362
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,791
[JUNICHI] It's an
amusement park at night,

363
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,958
so of course it's
nothing but couples.

364
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,000
Y'know, it kinda
makes me nervous--

365
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,375
H-Hey, where did you go?

366
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,125
[JUNICHI]
There are so many photo booths.

367
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,708
Which one is she in?

368
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,041
[yelps]

369
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,333
Whoa. Sorry, wrong booth!

370
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,125
[JUNICHI]
They're taking a kissing photo?

371
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,375
Man, real-life
couples are gross.

372
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,750
Wait a tick. What if Yukana
wants to try that with me?

373
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,958
[YUKANA]
Can't show you that.

374
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,583
There you are, junichi.

375
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,791
I thought you were
right behind me,

376
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,125
but then you just ghosted.

377
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,708
You scared me.

378
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,833
Sorry.

379
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,208
[YUKANA giggles]

380
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,375
'Kay, let's take a pic.

381
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,541
[JUNICHI]
Uh, okay.

382
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,791
[VOICE A]
Get ready to swap some spit!

383
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,041
They encourage that?

384
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,833
[YUKANA laughs]

385
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,125
That is hilarious!

386
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,541
We could just do a normal one.

387
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,250
We don't have to do
what the computers say.

388
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,666
Aw, but that's so boring and
played out, don't'cha think?

389
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,000
C'mon, Junichi, let's do it!

390
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,625
A kiss pic.

391
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,333
[VOICE A] Okay, here
we go, lovers! Three...

392
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,125
[JUNICHI]
Are you sure?

393
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,458
[VOICE A]
...two, one!

394
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,208
[YUKANA laughs]

395
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,333
You should see your face!
I'm literally dead right now!

396
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,875
[laughs]

397
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,250
[JUNICHI] Damn it! She tricked
me and I fell for it!

398
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,083
Why am I so
freaking gullible?

399
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,916
[YUKANA gasps]

400
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,875
It's so pretty! Prance over
here and take a look!

401
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,041
Wow, jeez.

402
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,583
[YUKANA]
Here, this is for you.

403
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,916
Thanks. I guess?

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,208
[YUKANA]
Aren't we just adorbs?

405
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,875
Hashtag relationship goals!

[JUNICHI chuckles]

407
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,333
Well, I'm happy it
makes you happy.

408
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,291
Tonight was fun, right?

409
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,166
[JUNICHI]
Yeah, super fun.

410
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,416
So thanks. I'm really glad
that you brought me here.

411
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,750
'Course!

412
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,500
Y'know, it's cool hanging
out with the whole gang,

413
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,000
but hanging out on
our own is nice, too.

414
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,625
Don't you think?

415
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,291
Let's come back here!

416
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,708
The same day next year,
and the year after that.

417
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,250
And then, every year after.

418
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,041
Yeah. It's a date.

419
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,208
Hey, so can I ask you something?

420
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,500
What is it you see in me

421
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,083
and why do you believe
in me so much?

422
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:49,250
I mean, after all the terrible
things I've said and done.

423
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,125
I'd tell you,

424
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,583
but then I'd have to kill you.

425
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,750
Oh. That's nice.

426
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,250
'Kay, bye-bye!

[YUI]
Good morning, Junichi.

429
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,291
Oh, hey there, Yui.

430
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,625
Hey, wait, before you go!

431
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,083
I wanted to thank
you for listening

432
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,458
to my problems the other day.

433
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,833
You helped me figure out
a lot of things up there.

434
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,666
There's no need to thank me.

435
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,083
I was just dishing out my
honest opinion, that's all.

436
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,500
No big deal.

437
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,041
If that somehow helped you
to solve a problem, well,

438
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,041
then you did the heavy lifting
all on your own, Junichi.

439
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,416
If you say so.

440
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,666
Oh, hey, I almost forgot to ask.

441
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,833
Are you into live
streaming at all?

442
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,041
[gasps]

443
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,958
Uh. Streaming? Don't
even know what that is.

444
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,666
Oh, well, there's this girl
who kinda looks like you

445
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,958
and I thought that maybe...

446
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,750
Nope! I've never even
heard of Mistress Boa.

447

[NENE]
Junichi! Guess who!

448
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,916
Nene, you're getting
too top-heavy for this!

449
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,250
What? Never!

450
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,666
[NENE]
Ooh.

451
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,041
Your face. It's looking
all handsome again.

452
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,958
Huh? Is that so?

453
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,041
Mh-hm. Yup, back to normal!

454
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,458
Uh, I guess that's good?

455
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,041
[RANKO]
Lucky you, Mister Virgin,

456
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,791
starting off your day with
all these girls around you.

457
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,708
[JUNICHI]
Oh, Ranko! And Yukana!

458
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,125
Good Morning, boyfriend.

459
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,958
Whoa. Something happened
between you two, didn't it?!

460
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,625
[NENE whines]

461
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,416
Seriously? You mean
just since yesterday?

462
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,666
[RANKO laughs]

463
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,375
Yeah, but you're still
a virgin, though, right?

464
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,458
'Cause if you're not, it's
bye-bye handsome giraffe.

465
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,666
Still a virgin.

466
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,166
Let's jet!

467
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,375
[YUI] Hey, they're
making a break for it!

468
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,250
[NENE]
Don't let 'em get away!

469
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,083
[GUYS]
This was truly a happy ending.

470
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
[AYUMI]
Yo, Ayumi here!

471
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,750
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

472
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,916
[AYUMI] Gah! It's all
over! The show's over!

473
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
[KOKORO]
Yep, totes over.

474
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,291
[AYUMI]
How are you so calm about this?

475
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,458
[KOKORO]
What do you mean?

476
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,208
[AYUMI] The season ended
without us getting

477
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,375
any major screen time!

478
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,625
[KOKORO]
Oh, yeah, right. That sucks!

479
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,625
[AYUMI] I told everyone
I was gonna be on TV!

480
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,916
[KOKORO]
Nobody else truly understands

481
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,250
our suffering, do they?

482
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,916
[AYUMI] Well, there's no
use bitching about it now!

483
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,166
[KOKORO] That's right!

484
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,000
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
See ya guys later! 'Kay, bye!
