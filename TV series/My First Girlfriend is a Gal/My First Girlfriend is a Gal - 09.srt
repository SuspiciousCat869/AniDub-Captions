1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,250
Yukana Yame, long time!

2
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,750
Wait, Dai?

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,625
When was the last time we saw
each other? Years, right?

4
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,625
Far too long if you ask me.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,958
Damn, I've missed you.

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,916
And you have really
filled out that body

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
since last time we
got our hang on.

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,625
So sweet.

9
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,208
I'm surprised I was even
able to recognize you

10
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,375
with your new look.

11
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,875
You dyed your hair!

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,291
Heh.

13
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,875
I guess I was pretty lame
in our middle school days.

14
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,416
But I should be dope enough
to hook up with you now.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,791
Whoa, Dai, coming
on strong much?

16
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
I don't remember you talking
this way. Someone's changed.

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,125
Uh. Oh, well.

18
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,041
I still would love for you to
come with me to lunch tomorrow.

19
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,708
Our old crew will be there.

20
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,125
Seriously?

21
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,125
I'm in! Let's get
our reminisce on!

22
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,041
Great. I'll spread the word.

23
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,333
[YUKANA]
Awesome!

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,208
[JUNICHI] What the hell?
He's a total Chad!

25
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:07,333
Ripped body. Alpha hair.
Probably ten inches soft!

26
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,708
He's got Yukana in
the palm of his hand.

27
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,500
And I-I don't wanna
be here anymore.

28
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,083
That's it.

29
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:18,041
I'll pretend I'm a useless lump
and just sink into the ground.

30
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,833
[DAI] They're gonna be
jacked to the tits.

31
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,375
[YUKANA] I haven't seen
most of them in forever!

32
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,708
In real life.
We Snap all the time.

33
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,250
[DAI] Man, Yukana,
you are such a hottie now.

34
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,666
You're gonna blow their minds.

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,791
You might even
blow more than that.

36
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,583
Wait, hold on. Who's that
weird dude with you?

37
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,166
Who?

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,083
It's just my boyfriend.

39
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,250
Junichi, I forgot
to introduce you.

40
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,916
That guy is Dai. We went to
middle school together.

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,208
Uh, what's up, bro?

42
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,041
I'm Junichi Hashiba. Yeah.

43
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,583
Call me Dai.

44
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,416
Nice to meet ya, June-y.

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,166
So you settled on a
nice guy, huh, Yukana?

46
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,583
I woulda thought with those
boobs you'd be way pickier.

47
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,000
[JUNICHI]
Speaking of boobs.

48
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,541
All right, enough
about the past!

49
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,708
You're embarrassing me
in front of my boyfriend!

50
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,083
Let's go, Junichi.

51
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,083
Bye! I'll see you
at lunch tomorrow!

52
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,166
[DAI]
Mm!

53
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,666
Oh my God, wasn't
that trip so fun?

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
Let's do one again next
year. Maybe we can...

55
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,791
[JUNICHI] It seems like
Yukana and that Dai guy

56
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,875
have kind of a past.

57
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,041
They're pretty friendly.

58
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,208
Oh, God, no! Did they date?

59
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,416
Think of me as an explorer.

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,458
Feeling my way through the
steamy undergrowth to love.

61
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,583
What happens when you
finally get to that love?

62
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,500
I drink from its essence.

63
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:54,500
Now, you must reveal your
fertile oasis to me, my peach.

64
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,708
[JUNICHI screams]

65
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,541
[JUNICHI]
Gross! Gross! Gross!

66
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,958
What's wrong? Junichi!

67
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,541
Nothing.

68
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,125
Sometimes you just gotta get the
bad thoughts out of your head.

69
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,666
Can you be less
"spazzy" and "weird"

70
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
and more "normal"
and "boyfriend"?

71
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,041
There.

72
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,958
[JUNICHI] After I
head-butted that light pole,

73
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,333
she still likes me.

74
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,750
Maybe there isn't
really anything

75
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,083
between her and
Chad Bonerschnitzle.

76
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,041
Unless, she's only
acting this way

77
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,916
so I don't get suspicious
and dig for dirt!

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,916
So wanna tell what's wrong?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,375
Uh, well.

80
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,250
That old friend you bumped into
seemed really handsome.

81
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,875
What? You mean, Dai?

82
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,166
His hair's better,
and he dresses better.

83
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,666
He's taller, with
better facial symmetry.

84
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,083
It's like he walked right off
the page of a girls' manga,

85
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,833
or a set of a gay porn.

86
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,416
Oh, God, there's nothing to be
jealous about, Junichi, c'mon.

87
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,208
But I can't beat that
guy by any standard.

88
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,416
When you two talked,

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,708
it felt like you were
meant for each other

90
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,458
and I should be somewhere else.

91
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,916
Hey, don't say that.
That's not true at all.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,208
And you got along so well, too.

93
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,416
I even got the vibe you
were a little embarrassed

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,458
introducing me to him
as your current boyfriend.

95
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,333
So you don't trust
me, is that it?

96
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,583
No.

97
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,208
Maybe.

98
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,875
Fine. Whatever. I'm going home.

99
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,583
So I just got back
from vacation,

100
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,833
and it was next-level bonkers!

101
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,958
Fun in the sun!

102
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,666
All my friends at the hot
springs had ginormous boobs!

103
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,375
Like, they're way
bigger than mine!

104
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,416
It was so embarrassing!

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,791
Wah! Wah!

106
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,583
[JUNICHI]
That's a weird coincidence.

107
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,875
I wonder if Boa is... Nah.

108
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,833
Holy balls. That
trip kicked ass!

109
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,750
I swear to God, guys,
ever since we've been home,

110
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,875
I haven't stopped jerking off.

111
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,166
Yeah, and those
cuties in floaties.

112
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,458
A shark wasn't the only
predator out there!

113
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,791
It's crazy!

114
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,250
Who'd ever think we'd get
to go on a beach trip

115
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,708
with willing females?

116
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,666
And we owe it all to this
fun-loving, happy guy here!

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,000
[JUNICHI sighs]

118
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:19,958
[JUNICHI]
No problem.

119
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,750
Uh, what's wrong?

120
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,208
You don't sound happy for a man

121
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,000
who was just on the beach
with top-shelf poon.

122
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,416
I'm very happy. Why do you ask?

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,916
Bro, I'm your best
friend and mentor.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,041
If something's got you down,
then it's got me down, too.

125
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
So, come on, tell
me what's wrong

126
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,500
and I'll help you out.

127
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
[JUNICHI]
Okay.

128
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,333
So, um, this guy...

129
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,916
That asshole.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,125
[KEIGO] This dude's bad
news for your balls.

131
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,375
[JUNICHI]
No, it's not a good situation.

132
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,750
[MINORU] Well, look,
worse-comes-to-worst,

133
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,250
you let her go ride him and
you hang with us again.

134
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,000
You can help me make
my maps of little kid--

135
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,125
[SHINPEI]
Junichi!

136
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,833
This is not N.T.R.! <i>Netorare</i> .

137
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,041
[JUNICHI]
Uh. What's " <i>netorare</i> "?

138
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,708
It's hentai. Cuck
porn to be exact.

139
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,250
[JUNICHI]
And what is "cuck"?

140
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,875
What you become when a man
takes your lover for himself,

141
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,666
and then ravages her sexually,
often right in front of you.

142
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,166
It's a shortening of the old
English word, "cuckold."

143
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,875
[JUNICHI]
What? "Cuckold"?

144
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,125
Wait a second, Junichi,

145
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,541
are you saying you
don't understand

146
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,250
any of the memes I send you?

147
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,041
Anyway, cuckoldry's
a fact of life,

148
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,000
which explains its enduring
popularity in amateur porn.

149
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,166
How is that popular?

150
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,208
It sounds awful!
Getting cheated on sucks!

151
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,708
Ooh!

152
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,875
I can tell by your tone
that you're turned on

153
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,541
by the humiliation that
comes with getting cucked.

154
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,791
[JUNICHI]
Dude, what the hell? No!

155
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,333
Barely three lines
ago, you said,

156
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,041
"Getting cheated on sucks."

157
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,541
That mix of dominance
and degradation

158
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,958

[YUI] Sounds like you

not be all that sincere.

this awful experience.

Whenever you smile like that

Why would that
make me marry you?

Yukana cheats and lies about it.

What's been going on with me?

Well, I liked this
one boy until today.

386
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,250
But now his
super-clueless response

has got me all bummed out.

00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,708
And I'm not just
depressed, either.

This guy's got me legit angry.

Y'know, outta respect.

But then today, things were bad
with them, and I made my move.

But he didn't get it.

396
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,875
Only thing he cared
about was himself.

He pisses me off!

398

I'm actually friends with the
girl he's still maybe-dating.

It's really hard, y'know?

He's bad talking to girls,
and he's a-a virgin.

And he's really not
cool, like at all.

402
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,541
But he's always been nice to me.

403
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,250
It happened so fast.

404

and the next thing y'know,

I'm falling for him.

406

That's why I need him
to act how he used to,

so he can take his rightful
spot as my servant!

00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,166
After I take her
to the bone zone,

471
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,166
I'll let you guys
blast her, too.

472
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,125
Slunts like this one
need lots of vitamin D.

473
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,916
[YUKANA] So what's your
idea of the perfect date

474
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,791
if you could do anything
in the world?

475
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,708
Sexist pigs!

476
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,291
Condoms are for boys.

477
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,791
I just finish on her belly.

478
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,208
[BRO D laughs]

479
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,416
[AYUMI]
Hey, guys, Ayumi here!

480
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,791
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

481
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,041
[YUKANA] You're so different
here compared to class.

482
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,958
[AYUMI] What? How would
anyone be able to tell?

483
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,250
[KOKORO]
Yeah, viewers barely know you

484
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,208
when you're only on
every third episode!

485
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,291
[YUKANA]
Viewers?

486
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,875
[KOKORO]
Stars only focus on themselves!

487
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,875
[AYUMI] We might as well just be
background extras to you, huh?

488
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,416
[YUKANA] I don't get it,
but we'll always be friends.

489
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,791
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
Give us screentime!

490
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,000
[YUKANA]
But the next one's the last.

491
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,958
[AYUMI, KOKORO]
Dammit!
