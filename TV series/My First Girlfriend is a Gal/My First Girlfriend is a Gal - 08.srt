159

Yeah, let's hurry it up!

160
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,541
[JUNICHI]
Oh no, what am I gonna do?

161
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,333
I'm not equipped
to deal with this!

162
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,375
What are we gonna do?

163
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,666
[CONSCIENCE] Who knew
we'd be asked to perform

164
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,166
such a nasty task?

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,541
Oh, if only he were here.

166
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,208
[JUNICHI] Alas,
I destroyed that degenerate

167
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,375
with my own handsome hands.

168
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958

Mister Virgin, wow!

172
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,958
Uh, the way you're touching us,
it's, uh, getting kinda pervy.

Don't you fucking listen to her!

Do it harder!
Give it to me harder!

00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,208
Hey, you're talking all
sexy on purpose, aren't you?

177
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,875
Man, we've spent the whole day
dragging this beached pedofile.

178
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,125
[SHINPEI] Mm. Barely noon
it is, young Padawan.

181
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,041
Answer me!

182
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,875
[SHINPEI] Remember, we're
staying here overnight,

183
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,875
and the night time
isa the right time.

184
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,458
Wait a second, are you sayin--?

185
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,375
[SHINPEI] Yes, but in
order to pull it off,

186
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,333
we're going to have to get
Kissass on board.

187
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,375
Here. I made this
one just for you.

[NENE]
Oh, that's okay,

189
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
I already fixed a
kebab for Junichi,

190
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,958
and this one has all of
his favorites on it, see?

191
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,541
[SHINPEI]
Yo, Junichi!

192
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,250
What are you dorks doing
all the way over here?

193
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,500
Nice of you to finally
join us. Let's chat.

Huh? What is it?
You're makin' me nervous.

'Kay, listen up.

00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,500
We've gotta bring you up to
speed on our genius plan.

Uhh...

00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,375
[YUKANA]
Those kebabs were delish.

199
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,416
Yeah, inn food's okay,
but sometimes it's nice

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
to try something
outside the bento box.

201
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,583
Are you hos ready to go?

202
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,166
[NENE]
Ready, Freddy.

203
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
[YUKANA]
Then let's skedaddle.

All right, men,
it's Zero Dark Dirty!

206
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,083
[SHINPEI]
Here.

207
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,458
Come on, guys, you can't
go through with this!

208
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,000
It's wrong!

209
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,541
No, what's wrong, maggot,

210
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,041
is you've got a fricking bun
where your hot dog should be.

211
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,375
[JUNICHI] For real, though,
peeping is a serious crime!

212
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,375
Not to mention a gross
invasion of privacy!

213
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,708
[SHINPEI] Junichi,
you poor, naïve bastard.

214
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,250
You don't know the first thing
about women, do you?

215
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,708
Allow me to red-pill you, bro.

216
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,458
If you don't try to sneak
a peek at a chick,

217
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,000
you're basically calling
her a ass face swamp-beast!

218
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,083
So it's rude not to
peep at their pipis.

219
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,291
That's insane!

220
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,666
Wow, what a douche.

221
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,875
Why do you wanna give those
girls body image issues?

222
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,458
How am I the bad guy here?

223
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,958
[SHINPEI]
Never mind that!

224
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,375
You've got a choice
to make here!

225
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,625
If you don't join us and peep,
you're a maggot, son!

226
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,625
You'll be disrespecting those
girls, and yourself, Gomer!

227
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,458
C'mon, dude, don't you
wanna catch a glimpse

228
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,458
of Yukana's yabbos?

229
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,041
Of course I freakin' do!

230
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,916
I wanna see 'em more
than you guys do!

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,875
I wanna see 'em more than
anything in the world!

232
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,583
Whoa, chill out, dude,
they're just yabbos.

233
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,083
It's because I wanna see
'em so much that I can't.

234
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,541
Calm down, Junichi, you're
not making any sense.

235
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,583
[JUNICHI]
I wanna see 'em.

236
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,958
I just don't really
wanna ogle them

237
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,916
through night vision goggles.

You don't like gazongas,
fine, stay here.

into the men's bath as long
as they're not too old.

00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,583
just to keep pervs like us

312
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,958
from getting close
to the women's bath?

313
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,291
That kinda thing only
happens in anime.

314
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,208
Whoa, you guys tricked me?

315
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,333
Ha! Says the lowlife
backstabbing traitor!

316
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,041
Since you've done this
kinda thing before,

317
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,041
we knew we needed to test you!

318
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,625
What? Done this before?

319
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,916
I don't remember that episode!

320
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,416
And anyway, I haven't
done anything wrong!

321
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,166
Yeah? Well, let's
put that to a vote.

322
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,666
Those who think Junichi Hashiba
is innocent of treason...

323
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,708
Aye!

324
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,458
All those who
know he's guilty...

325
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,666
[BOTH]
Aye!

326
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,041
Screw the popular vote!

327
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,625
Oh, get over it!
You lost fair and square!

328
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,833
Get back here, traitor!

329
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,458
[JUNICHI] Damn it! I've gotta
get outta these woods somehow!

330
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,833
[screams]

331
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,833
Is he dead?

332
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,458
'Course not, he's
the main character.

333
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,416
And we still have
two episodes to go.

334
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,666
Come on, move out!

335
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,833
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

336
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,291
[KEIGO]
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

337
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,333
Look! The women's bath is close!

338
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,208
It'll be an
all-you-can-peep muff-et!

339
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,666
A total whore-gasbord!
An ass-eteria--

340
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,333
[screams]

341
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,166
Keigo!

342
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,166
[KEIGO grunting]

343
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,958
[KEIGO]
Pull me up!

344
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,083
What the--? C'mon, dude!

345
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,166
[KEIGO] I thought you said
there was no way an innkeeper

346
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,041
would set up traps like this!

347
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,583
[SHINPEI] I don't know,
it seemed ridiculous, but--

348
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,000
[KEIGO]
Shinpei!

349
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,166
This is FUBAR.
TARFUN FISHMO bro!

350
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,083
No! We can't just cut and run!

351
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,291
We've lost too much already
in service of this mission!

352
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,458
Our best friend
is dead. To us now!

353
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,333
Don't let his
sacrifice be in vain!

354
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,500
[KEIGO]
But, Shinpei.

355
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,416
Do you remember when
you chose the route

356
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
that was sure to make the
heroine hate you, Keigo,

357
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,333
knowing full well it would
deprive you of a happy ending,

358
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,416
all so you could finally
get to the damn treasure?

359
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,458
Where's those balls?

360
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,625
In my pants!

361
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,500
[SHINPEI]
Look!

362
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,916
Right in front of us, soldier,

363
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,250
is a route that we haven't
been able to complete yet.

364
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,375
And if we give up now,

365
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,875
we may never again
have an opportunity

366
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,791
to complete this one!

367
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,375
I see now.

368
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,083
In order to seek out my life's
treasure, I'm gonna have to--

369
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:04,708
[KEIGO,SHINPEI yelling]

370
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,000
[BOTH]
Down!

371
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,541
[BOTH screaming]

372
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,166
[KEIGO, SHINPEI]
Up!

373
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,333
[laughing]

374
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,416
Hell yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

375
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,666
We're invincible! Nothing can--

376
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,375
[KEIGO]
Shinpei, what's wrong?

377
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,958
Sh-Shinpei!

378
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,666
They got me. I've been--

379
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,000
[thud]

380
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,250
Uh! Shinpei!

381
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,333
Gasp.

382
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,916
I'm not gonna make it.

383
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,125
It's all goin' black now.

384
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,416
Hang on! They're
just suction cups!

385
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,958
You don't have to lie
just to comfort me.

386
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,583
Now go on, leave me behind,
and just go, y'hear me?

387
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,041
Complete the mission and
go live out our dream.

388
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,416
Hang in there!

389
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,833
You know I-I can't complete
the mission without you!

390
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:54,000
There's no way to copy
my save data to you!

391
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:59,291
Keigo, earn this!

392
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,833
[wails]

393
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,916
[KEIGO]
Game over, man! Game over!

394
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,708
Ooh, fireworks!

395
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,083
[RANKO]
Okay, now that is straight fire!

396
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,875
Pretty, innit it?

397
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,541
[GIRLS laughing]

398
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,166
[YUI]
Are you sure these are safe?

399
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,666
Oh, you're coming to.

400
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,416
Huh?

401
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,291
[JUNICHI yelps]

402
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,375
[JUNICHI]
Yukana?

403
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,916
Hey, sleepyhead.

404
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,916
We just came down here to
light up some sparklers,

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,125
and then found you
passed out on the beach.

406
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,250
[JUNICHI] Oh, right. I fell
off that cliff because--

407
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,083
Where are Shinpei and Keigo?

408
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,625
Mean your annoying
pervy friends?

409
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,125
Well, I guess...

410
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,833
I don't really know
what happened,

411
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,958
but they were found out cold
in the forest behind the inn.

412
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
[JUNICHI]
Huh, you don't say.

413
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,291
[YUKANA] And apparently,
your husky friend

414
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,875
suffered an extreme
loss of fluids,

415
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,916
and passed out in the bath.

416
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,291
You guys cause so much drama!

417
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,375
Uh, sorry.

418
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,083
It's cool.

419
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,666
But you guys might wanna
leave an extra-generous tip

420
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,750
for the inn staff when we leave.

421
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,750
[YUKANA] Y'know, this has really
been a super fun trip, Junichi.

422
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:29,000
Turned out a little different
from how I imagined it.

423
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,666
But then maybe that's
for the best, right?

424
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,666
[YUKANA giggles]

425
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,125
Sorry. I ruined it.

426
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,208
Say what? I just told
you I had a great time.

427
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,916
Let's come back, just us two!

428
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,208
So what's your idea
of the perfect date

429
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,916
if you could do
anything in the world?

430
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Uh. In the world?

431
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,750
[JUNICHI] Guess I should
try to think of something

432
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,708
that would make Yukana happy.

433
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,125
[JUNICHI] Uh, how about going to
an amusement park? At night?

434
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,625
[YUKANA]
Aww, that's cute.

435
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,458
And kinda romantic.

436
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,833
[JUNICHI]
Really?

437
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,916
[YUKANA] Well, you tried to
think of something good,

438
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,333
and that's what counts.

439
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,833
[JUNICHI] Well, you know it's
'cause I care about you.

440
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,541
[YUKANA]
That's so sweet.

441
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,375
Alrighty then, let's go to one.

442
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,375
An amusement park. At night.

443
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,041
That was really fun.

444
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,666
Oh, yeah.

445
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,458
I was wondering.

446
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,250
[YUKANA]
Hm?

447
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,125
[DAI]
Whoa, Yukana?

448
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,208
[YUKANA]
Dai, is that you?

449
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,166
Who's he?

450
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,708
[AYUMI]
Yo, Ayumi here!

451
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,291
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

452
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,750
[GUYS] Why do the three of us
have to talk at the same time?

453
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,416
[AYUMI] Just be grateful
you're even here at all!

454
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,041
[KOKORO] If you each got to
talk, we'd have fewer lines!

455
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,083
[AYUMI]
Y'know, in the manga,

456
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,666
you guys didn't
have names, either!

457
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,083
[SHINPEI] So why do you get to
be such a big part of the show?

458
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,000
[GUYS]
Aw, you're making me blush.

459
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,916
[AYUMI]
Shut up!
