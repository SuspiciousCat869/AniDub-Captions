00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,916
[KEIGO]
I'm growing a mustache.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,541
--Hey, what's up?
--Makes sense.

3
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,750
Ah, we have something for you!

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,833
What is it?

5
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:21,750
This.

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,916
It's a party game.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,791
[JUNICHI]
What the hell?

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,500
Have you done any sexy-time
with the lady yet?

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,125
Uh, does hugging count?

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,625
[KEIGO, SHINPEI chuckle]

11
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,125
[SHINPEI] That's why we
wanna play the King Game!

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,041
It's spin-the bottle
meets truth-or-dare!

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,083
It's a license to grab boob!

14
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,791
Just us three?

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,916
I don't really wanna grab
any part of you guys.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,625
No offense.

17
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,875
[JUNICHI]
Hey.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,291
[SHINPEI]
It's a party game, Junichi.

19
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,750
You play with guys and girls.
It's all in the article.

20
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,375
"Chicks lose their inhibitions
when they're having fun."

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,500
Why would a men's
magazine ever lie to us?

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,458
Junichi, you're friends with
three of the most wonderful guys

23
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,916
in the world, right?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,833
We're not just
friends, we're bros!

25
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,208
And if movies
taught me anything,

26
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,875
it's that bros help bros
get that sweet P.

27
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,000
[SHINPEI]
Believe it or not,

28
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,916
you have the easiest
part in all this.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,458
Convince Yukana to host a
little shindig at her house

30
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,708
when her parents are gone and
invite only her hottest friends!

31
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,333
[KEIDO]
Mh-hm.

32
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,958
Okay! I'll do it!

33
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,166
[KEIGO, SHINPEI chuckle]

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,916
But, uh, I just have
to ask first.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,166
What's up with him
and that recorder?

36
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,666
Fingering is so fun.

37
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,250
[JUNICHI]
I know I said would ask her,

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,833
but how exactly am I
supposed to do this?

39
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,291
[YUKANA]
Earth to Junichi!

40
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,458
[yelps]

41
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,666
Yeah! Sure!

42
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,083
Hey. You didn't hear
a word I said, did you?

43
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,500
No. Sorry. What were
we talking about?

44
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,208
I asked you about
summer break!

45
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,791
Oh, right! Yeah, that's it!

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,625
Summer vacation's coming up!

47
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,333
What exactly did you ask?

48
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,666
Ow!

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,916
I have the dumbest
boyfriend ever!

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,583
I asked if you had any ideas

51
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,791
for things we could
do over the break!

52
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,041
[JUNICHI]
Poopoo, peepee, caca!

53
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,708
All my brain power's
been thinking of ways

54
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,083
to get her to invite us over.

55
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,958
I gotta play this delicately.

56
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,708
Okay. Well, I'm happy doing
anything you suggested.

57
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,083
I like letting my woman
make the decisions.

58
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:55,958
Well, great!

59
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,208
Buckle up, boyfriend,

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,000
because this summer we
are getting ca-ray-zay.

61
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,375
First...

62
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
[JUNICHI] She's so hot.
And she's thinking about me.

63
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,208
About us as a couple!

64
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,666
I'm sure she'll be cool then

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,875
if I suggest we invite over
some friends to hang out.

66
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,291
But wait. I haven't
even been to her place.

67
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,708
Okay, first, I gotta
get her to invite me.

68
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,291
Hey, honey.

69
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:20,083
I was thinking I-I could
stop by your place, maybe.

70
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,958
After school.

71
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,958
[YUKANA]
Uh.

72
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,083
Today? Today-Today?

73
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,625
[JUNICHI]
Yeah! I mean, no?

74
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,958
If you've already got plans,
we can do it some other time.

75
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,166
I was just thinking,
y'know. Yeah.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,750
[YUKANA]
Sure.

77
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,291
[JUNICHI]
Wait, seriously?

78
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,416
[YUKANA]
Mh-hm.

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,708
So what do you wanna
do once we're--?

80
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,541
[JUNICHI] Well, I wouldn't
be the only one there.

81
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,083
I thought we'd invite
Ranko, Nene,

82
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,208
and some friends of mine, too.

83
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,458
Like a party.

84
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,916
Wow, did that guy just
Charlie Bravo himself?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,666
[STUDENT A] Charlie Bravo?
You mean cock block.

86
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,833
So you okay with that?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,458
[YUKANA]
Yeah. Sure. Invite whomever.

88
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,958
[JUNICHI]
What? Why's she so mad?

89
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,208
What's wrong with
inviting other people?

90
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,583
So I'll text Ranko about it.

91
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,958
Why don't you ask your friends
and munchkin big boobs girl.

92
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,583
Uh, if you don't wanna do
this, we don't have to.

93
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,875
Like, if you're mad.

94
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,750
No, I'm not mad, we'll do this.

95
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,875
You will come over to my house

96
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,000
along with all our
other friends.

97
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,291
[JUNICHI] I-I really
don't understand girls.

98
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,416
[JUNICHI] Not only will this be
my first time at her house,

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,416
it sounds like there's a chance
we'll be alone for a little bit.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,750
Junichi! You're coming
straight to my house, right?

101
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,250
Nene and my buddies
said they needed

102
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,583
to go drop some things
off at home first.

103
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,458
Yeah, Ranko says she's
stopping at home to change.

104
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,875
[JUNICHI]
You better play it cool!

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,666
[YUKANA] Until the others get
here, it's just you and me.

106
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,375
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

107
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,791
[JUNICHI yelps]

108
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,333
[HUNICHI]
Whoa, what if someone walks in?

109
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,416
It won't take that long...

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
...for me to make you a man.

111
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,708
O-Okay, let's do it!

112
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,333
[STUDENT B]
Is he humping his bag?

113
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,791
[STUDENT C]
He's making me uncomfortable.

114
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,208
Junichi, are you okay?

115
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,500
[JUNICHI screams]

116
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,625
Uh, what's up, Yui?
I'm totally fine.

117
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,208
Nothin' much.
Going home to study.

118
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,375
What's going on with you?

119
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,166
I saw a bunch of
wriggling and moaning.

120
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,833
Do you have to pee or something?

121
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,458
Oh, twas a bee.
That's what that was.

122
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
He sure got me good.

123
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,166
[YUI]
Are you waiting for someone?

124
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,958
Yeah. You remember
Yukana, right?

125
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,375
Oh, yeah, her.

126
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,125
Well, have fun on your
after-school date.

127
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,208
What? No, it's not a date.

128
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,458
Me and few friends from class

129
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,625
are going over to her
house to play a game.

130
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,958
That sounds fun.

131
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,208
[JUNICHI chuckles]

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Shouldn't you, you know,
go home and study?

133
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,250
No, it can wait.

134
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,250
My schedule for this
afternoon is wide open.

135
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,583
Cool. That's nice for you.

136
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,708
Like I said, I'm wide open.

137
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm ready, willing, and able.

138
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,666
I got that.

139
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,166
[JUNICHI gasps]

140
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,500
[JUNICHI] Oh, no. She's
making a move on me again.

141
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,583
Have to get her off my back

142
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,583
before I do something
I'll regret!

143
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,291
So, um, you maybe
wanna come to?

144
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, if you insist,
I think I can make some time.

145
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,500
I'd be happy to come.

146
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,416
[YUI chuckles]

147
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,875
Now just text me the address

148
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,833
because I'm gonna go home
and freshen up first.

149
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,000
Here's my number. And address.

150
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,291
'Cause you never know.

151
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,291
Till then. I'll see
you soon, Junichi.

152
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,875
Damn. She is fucking crazy.

153
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,291
Hey, I'm here.
Oh no, what's wrong?

154
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,791
Uh, well, uh, I kinda maybe
invited Yui over, too.

155
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,666
Is that okay?

156
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,250
Yeah, sure. Invite everyone.

157
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,583
I've got enough string cheese
and apple juice for the school.

158
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,875
--[JUNICHI] Uh. Hm?

00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,625
[SHINPEI laughing]

160
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,000
[JUNICHI]
"Everyone"?

161
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,333
Are my friends trying to
turn a playful get-together

162
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,458
into a sweaty orgy?

163
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,083
[JUNICHI]
Her making me sit out here

164
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,541
is a real bucket of cold
water on the ol' junk.

165
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,500
So I'd feel better if you stayed
out here while I change.

166
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,041
[JUNICHI ]
Mhm. Wait, you're gonna change?

167
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,583
If you're good,
I'll let you peek in once.

168
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,916
[gasps]

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,750
No! I couldn't.

170
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,791
[laughs]

171
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
I'm just kidding!

172
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,916
You don't have the balls
to peep, anyway.

173
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,291
[grunts]

174
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,666
[JUNICHI]
The nerve of her.

175
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,375
Saying that I don't have
the balls to see her melons!

176
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,250
Here goes nothing.

177
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,041
[YUKANA]
I'm all done! Come in!

178
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,083
[JUNICHI screams]

179
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,916
Aw, why're you
always freaking out?

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,958
[JUNICHI chuckles nervously]

181
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,500
Nothing, I'm good.

182
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,416
Well, come on in then.

183
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Sorry about all tha--

184
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,875
[JUNICHI] So this is
a teenage girl's room.

185
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,833
It's way different
from a dude's.

186
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,125
For one, everything's glowing.

187
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,958
And not just under
a black light!

188
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,458
Um, can you not stare
like that? It creeps me out.

189
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,458
Here.

190
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,500
[JUNICHI]
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

191
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,375
[JUNICHI]
Look at that body.

192
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,125
Her outfit for just hanging
around the house is hot as hell!

193
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,333
I like that braid,
too. It's playful.

194
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,208
Girl next door meets, uh--
Ah, who cares?

195
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,541
Let's look at her cleavage!

196
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,500
I wanna be in there!
I wanna be friends with it.

197
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,458
[YUKANA]
Hey!

198
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,916
Turn your "pervert" off!

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,958
No, I-- I checked
you out. Sorry.

200
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,375
[sighs]

201
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,583
[YUKANA]
So, tell me, Junichi.

202
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,583
Do you love all boobs,
or is it just like my boobs?

203
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,833
[JUNICHI] Uh, yeah.
That's right. They are.

204
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,250
Are your parents here?

205
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,875
They're out of town right now.

206
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,916
[JUNICHI gasps]

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,958
[JUNICHI] So that's why
she got mad earlier.

208
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,208
She really did want
just me to come over.

209
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,666
But then I went and invited
all my dumb friends!

210
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,833
[JUNICHI]
This-This was my big chance!

211
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,458
We could be rocking the sheets!

212
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,625
I'm an idiot!

213
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,875
We'll never get another
chance like this!

214
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,166
How very un-cool.

215
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,000
[JUNICHI] What's the point
of playing some party game

216
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,958
when I could've
just gotten laid?

217
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
[YUKANA]
Hey, Junichi.

218
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,458
I think there's still some time
before our friends show up.

219
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,791
[RANKO]
What're you doing to her?

220
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,291
[BOTH gasp]

221
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,166
[chuckles]

222
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,875
Cheese-and-rice, Ranko, don't
you believe in knocking first?

223
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,000
Like how'd you even
get inside the house?

224
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,250
I took the spare key you
guys keep behind the ficus.

225
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,833
So were you guys
about to get it on?

226
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,500
No. I was just teasing him

227
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,708
because it always
makes him freak out.

228
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
Junichi doesn't
have the balls yet

229
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,291
to actually do
sex stuff with me.

230
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,958
[JUNICHI]
What?!

231
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,791
[JUNICHI] I have blue
balls, do they count?

232
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,041
[NENE]
Junichi?

233
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,666
[JUNICHI gasps]

234
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,916
I give you a "season pass"
to touch my boobs

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,958
whenever you want to.

236
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,375
I don't wanna
touch those things!

237
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,500
[JUNICHI grunts]

238
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,666
Oh, no!

239
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
[YUI]
Sorry about that, Junichi.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,416
I was passing through and
my knee must've slipped.

241
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,583
[RANKO]
Hold on.

242
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,375
No one told me this girl
was gonna be here.

243
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,500
[YUI chuckles]

244
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,250
Oh, Ranko, you and
that barbed tongue.

245
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:37,000
Is it really so unexpected
for classmates to hang out?

246
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,500
[JUNICHI]
That knee hurt. Huh?

247
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,750
[JUNICHI]
In less than five minutes,

248
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,958
the girliest, most
organized bedroom ever

249
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,583
has descended into pure chaos!

250
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,375
[doorbell rings]

251
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,375
Hold on a sec, guys,
while I answer the door.

252
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,708
The last guests have arrived.

253
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,166
[GUYS]
Hello, ladies.

254
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,458
[JUNICHI yelps]

255
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,791
[JUNICHI]
Shinpei. Keigo.

256
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,166
What the hell are
you guys wearing?

257
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,291
[SHINPEI]
Pretty sweet, huh?

258
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,000
They say nothin'
drops panties faster

259
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,500
than a little video game attire.

260
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,041
And I think...

261
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,291
[JUNICHI] It's a miracle you
weren't stopped on the way over

262
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,875
and asked to take the red pill.

263
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,416
And Keigo looks like
he's going clubbing

264
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,583
on the Jersey shore!

265
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,916
Hey, shut up, I look great.

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,916
They call this peacocking, brah.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,416
[JUNICHI] Minoru, you actually
look normal, I'm impre--

268
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,458
Oh, you brought the recorder!
No, you brought two of them.

269
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,875
Why did Shinpei and
Keigo let you do that?

270
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,041
Hell, why does everything

271
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,625
always have to be so
weird with you guys?

272
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,708
[MINORU] Junichi,
something bothering you?

273
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,208
[JUNICHI]
Is something bothering me?

274
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,750
Seriously? Why don't you
morons look in a mirror?

275
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,291
Junichi's friends are
hilarious, aren't they?

276
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,416
[JUNICHI] Uh-huh...
They're crackin' me up.

277
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,791
Yep. These are my friends.

278
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,291
I don't think you've
actually all met them,

279
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,125
so I'll go around the table.

280
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,583
That's Shinpei, and
Keigo, and Minoru.

281
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,000
[SHINPEI, KEIGO]
Yo. Nice to meet you, 'ey!

282
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,333
Great, we met.

283
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,333
Are we just supposed to sit
around now and talk?

284
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,583
[SHINPEI]
I got just the thing!

285
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,166
When Junichi invited us, I said,

286
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,916
"Hey, Keigo, there's
gonna be girls there,

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,291
let's bring that one game."

288
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,916
Would you like to
know what it is? Yes?

289
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,291
[SHINPEI] Maybe you've have
heard of a little something

290
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,541
called "The King Game."

291
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,958
[JUNICHI] I'm sure the way
Shinpei talks about it

292
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,208
will make it sound
super cringe-y.

293
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,416
But if we can start
playing and having fun,

294
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,458
the girls might let
their guard down.

295
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,291
[YUKANA]
What? The King Game?

296
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,625
That's random.

297
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,583
I've never played it
before, but sure, I'll try.

298
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,208
I hope you're not
suggesting this

299
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,125
so you can do something pervy.

300
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,500
[SHINPEI, KEIGO]
She onto us!

301
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,125
What? No way.

302
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,416
We would never do something
like that. Tell her.

303
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,166
[SHINPEI]
Uh, yeah, I swear:

304
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,000
W-We didn't come here
to force you fine ladies

305
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,500
to do something questionable
with all your friends around.

306
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,666
This sounds fun!
I wanna play it!

307
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,083
[YUI]
Hm?

308
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,250
[NENE] It's the perfect
opportunity to ravage Junichi

309
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,458
without any consequences!

310
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
All right, if they're
both playing this,

311
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,500
then I'm gonna play, too.

312
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,000
[RANKO] If the game's
what I think it is,

313
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,250
I might get to be
handsy with Yukana.

314
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,916
[JUNICHI] I don't think
this will end well.

315
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,041
Let's rock.

316
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,208
[SHINPEI] All right,
to play the King Game,

317
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,583
everyone, take a chopstick.

318
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,625
Now!

319
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,458
Everyone, look at your stick
and see if you're the King!

320
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,750
[KEIGO]
It's me!

321
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm the King!

322
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,666
[SHINPEI]
Bingo.

323
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
Huh?

324
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,791
[SHINPEI, KEIGO snickering]

325
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,166
[JUNICHI]
Look at those faces.

326
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,916
They've definitely got
something up their sleeves.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Please don't be gross!
Please don't be gross!

328
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,708
Number Two bitch slaps Five!

329
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,208
[JUNICHI] Oh, I guess
I was wrong about them

330
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,083
getting too perverted--

331
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,250
[JUNICHI yelps]

332
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,375
[NENE]
Junichi!

333
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,250
I drew stick number two.
Mister Virgin, drew number five.

334
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,875
I don't think it left a--
Yeah, it left a mark.

335
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,666
Oh. I'll be okay, don't worry.

336
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,083
Ranko!

337
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,916
Why do you have to be so
aggressive with my boyfriend?

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,166
My bad! Sorry!

339
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,500
[chuckles]

340
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,125
It's all good.

341
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,666
If that...

342
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,125
[JUNICHI] That actually went
better than I expected it to.

343
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,000
Why, of course it did.
It's a process, my friend.

344
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,958
A process that only ends when
you get some action with her.

345
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,833
Now, watch as the
second round unfolds.

346
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,041
[chuckles]

347
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,375
[SHINPEI]
All right, everyone...

348
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,791
[JUNICHI]
Is this where it gets pervy?

349
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,166
[SHINPEI]
One per person.

350
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,375
[YUKANA]
What? I'm the King!

351
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,708
Let's see.

352
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,541
How 'bout whoever
drew stick number one

353
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,333
introduces themselves
in baby talk.

354
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,375
[YUI groans]

355
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,666
Huh?

356
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,625
[RANKO chuckles]

357
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,166
I know!

358
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,791
Let's record our game and put it
up on YouTube, so everyone--

359
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,833
[YUI] All right,
all right. I'll do it!

360
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,541
'Kay, here goes nothin'.

361
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,500
[YUKANA]
Wow, she's standing up.

362
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,000
All right, Yui, hit us with
your best goo-goo-g-ga.

363
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:59,791
Hello! My names Yui.
I like to have fun.

364
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,583
Last week, I pooped
in the sandbox

365
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,166
and blamed it on the dog.

366
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,541
[YUI giggles]

367
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,583
[laughs]

368
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,041
Hilarious!

369
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,000
Yui, oh my God, you're so
lucky we didn't record that!

370
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,000
[RANKO]
Hey, whoever is King next...

371
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,625
[SHINPEI] The girls are
really getting into it now.

372
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,416
[YUI]
Ha, ha, very funny.

373
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,708
Can we just start the next
round of this dumb game?

374
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,916
[ALL]
And the King is...

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,375
[YUI] Ha-ha! It seems
that now I'm the King!

376
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,625
That means I'll order Number Six

377
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,791
to do a sexy stripper pose
in front of all the boys.

378
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,291
That's me!

379
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,541
One hot lap dance
comin' right up, fellas!

380
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,375
[OTHERS gasp]

381
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, wow. The view from
up here is so great!

382
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,416
[NENE] Junichi, what do you
think of my stripper pose?

383
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Do you like it as much
as the other boys?

384
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,916
[JUNICHI] Uhh... It's like
I'm inspecting produce.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,458
[YUI]
All right, that's enough.

386
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,750
I said do a pose, not
rub your airbags right

387
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,041
in the driver's face.

388
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,541
Uh, Junichi. You're, like,
literally drooling.

389
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,708
[JUNICHI]
Huh? What? No, I'm not.

390
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,875
[YUKANA giggles]

391
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,875
I'm just kidding.
I know it's all for fun.

392
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,875
[chuckles]

393
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,833
[NENE] I'm thirsty. Do you
have anything to drink?

394
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,375
[YUKANA]
Here!

395
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,833
[KEIDO chuckles]

396
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,083
[KEIDO] I think we should do
the thing next, you know,

397
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,541
with the thing and the
sticks so the girls to--

398
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,708
All right, it's time.

399
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,541
What are you guys
whispering about now?

400
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,791
The next round.

401
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,000
We're finally at the moment

402
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,000
when you and Yukana
will share a kiss.

403
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,583
And we'll kiss her friends.

404
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,458
What? How do you know?

405
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,041
[SHINPEI] I want you to look at
how I'm holding the chopsticks.

406
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,875
Go.

407
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,791
The back one sticks
out the farthest,

408
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,625
as they get closer to my
thumb, they stick out less.

409
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,666
It's human nature to
always reach for the one

410
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,416
that's sticking out the most.

411
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
This means I can arrange
the sticks ahead of time,

412
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,375
so that I end up King.

413
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,791
I'll even be able to know who
has picked what number.

414
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't really hear you,

415
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,708
so I'll just take
your word for it.

416
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,750
Junichi, you have the most
important job in all of this.

417
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,583
You're the dealer.

418
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,083
[JUNICHI]
Whoa.

419
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,041
It's fishy if the dealer
ends up the King.

420
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,000
Take them!

421
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:10,833
[JUNICHI]
Uh. What, now?

422
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:11,833
Hey, Keigo!

423
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,208
Quick, question for ya, is...?

424
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,458
[JUNICHI]
I don't know.

425
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,208
Maybe a party game
isn't the right place

426
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,458
to kiss Yukana for
the first time, after all.

427
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,666
'Specially if I rigged it.

428
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,791
And it's definitely not fair
to force the other girls

429
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,666
to risk getting a cold
sore from my friends.

430
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,875
[SHINPEI] Anyway, let's play!
This time, Junichi deals!

431
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,000
[JUNICHI]
Okay, who's the King?

432
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,125
[chuckles]

433
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,791
What? Now I'm the King?

434
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,208
[chuckles]

435
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,416
As the King,
I order One to kiss me!

436
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
And I also order Number Three
to kiss Two, with their tongue!

437
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,625
A kiss? For real?

438
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,083
Yeah, I don't really know
about this one, King.

439
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,125
Junichi's the only guy
I'll force myself on.

440
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,250
[RANKO chuckles]

441
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,750
Well, you've got balls.

442
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,833
I think you're taking
this too far.

443
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,125
[SHINPEI]
Shut up!

444
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,083
You must obey your King!
His orders are absolute!

445
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,000
Now, Numbers One,
Two, and Three,

446
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,750
raise your hands and
get ready to swap spit!

447
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,791
Oh. It looks like
I'm Number Three.

448
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,541
So which one of you guys
am I supposed to kiss now?

449
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,583
[screams]

450
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,125
[SHINPEI]
You switched them up on us!

451
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,500
[JUNICHI]
I had no choice.

452
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,375
The girls thought they were
coming over to have fun,

453
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,333
not get tongued punched by a
guy dressed for a comic con!

454
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,250
I can't let you take
advantage of them.

455
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,750
Even if that means sacrificing
my chances with Yukana.

456
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,250
[SHINPEI]
Damn you, Junichi!

457
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,583
[GIRLS]
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

458
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,583
Kiss him. Kiss him!

459
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,416
Yukana. What was he saying
about obeying the King?

460
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,625
Right.

461
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,291
It was something about
how absolute orders

462
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,458
must be followed.

463
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:09,041
All right. It's time. Sack up
and go kiss your King.

464
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,583
[KEIGO screams]

465
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:19,791
[GIRLS] Kiss him. Kiss him.
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

466
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:27,458
[GUYS grunting, groaning]

467
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,375
[YUKANA]
That was savage!

468
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,375
Yeah, we should hang out

469
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,708
and play the King
Game more often.

470
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,375
Watching them get
sick making-out

471
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,750
totally made up for
the baby-talk thing.

472
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,958
That's right.

473
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,791
[JUNICHI]
I just French-kissed a dude.

474
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,416
Screw chivalry, he tasted
like the inside liquid

475
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,958
of a hot dog package.

476
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,291
Hey, thanks for taking
that bullet, Junichi.

477
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,458
[JUNICHI]
Huh?

478
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,625
[RANKO] Think he's a
good kisser with girls?

479
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,708
[YUI]
Well, either way...

480
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, anything for you!

481
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,916
Hey! You two! It's rude to
flirt in public, y'know?

482
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,125
[YUKANA giggles]

483
00:20:59,208 --> 00:20:59,958
That's it!

484
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,166
Huh? What's it?

485
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,916
D'you remember when
we were talking about

486
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,833
going somewhere
over summer break?

487
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,375
So like, wouldn't it be more fun

488
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,458
if all of us went on
that trip together?

489
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,166
Yeah, that would be fun.

490
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,708
Thank God we're
not all actually

491
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,125
going on vacation
together, though,

492
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,625
it would be a total disa--

493
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,500
Hey, wait, were you serious?

494
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,958
Of course, silly! Who wants in?

495
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,458
I'm so down! Let's
totes hit up the ocean!

496
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,833
Well, wait.

497
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,041
Okay, if I move some things
around in my schedule,

498
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,500
I can open a few days.

499
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,708
Yay! I'm gonna buy
a new swimsuit!

500
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,958
Finally, a chance to work
on my other breast stroke.

501
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,291
[KEIGO] Better start
taking Creatine again.

502
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,916
...when they walk by.

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
Wait, I'm not sure
I have the money.

504
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,291
I spent a ton on this new look.

505
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,583
I don't really
have any, either.

506
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,291
I know! Why don't
we all get a job?

507
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,875
If we start working right away,

508
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,875
we'll have just enough time to
save up before school gets out.

509
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,083
[SHINPEI, KEIGO]
Mh-hm.

510
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,916
And I bet the beach
seems that much nicer

511
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,083
if we go with our own
hard-earned money.

512
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,375
[ALL giggle]

513
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,791
That's that! Jobs and beach!

514
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,333
Sometime in the
next few episodes!

515
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,208
[OTHERS]
Yay!

516
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,291
[AYUMI]
Hey, it's Ayumi!

517
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,541
[KOKORO]
And Kokoro!

518
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,500
[AYUMI] We've haven't
been on in two weeks!

519
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,000
[KOKORO]
I know, right?

520
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,625
[AYUMI] They're all partying
and playing games, it sucks!

521
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,875
[KOKORO]
I know, right?

522
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,041
[AYUMI] Yukana wants her
friends to go on a trip,

523
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,500
but she didn't
think to invite us!

524
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,500
[KOKORO]
I know, right?

525
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,416
[AYUMI]
And for some weird reason,

526
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,666
you keep repeating yourself!

527
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,000
[KOKORO]
I know, right?
