00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.439 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] I knew it would be bad,
but I didn't think it would
be this bad.

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.910 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, it's fine. This sort of
interior design is normal
for a boy's room.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you'd better quit
while you're ahead.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right! As his sister,
I can't let this go.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:17.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
Time to clean!

00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:53.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow, just like that,
it's already clean.

00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:56.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] That's amazing, Mei!
You're like a pro at this.

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:59.692 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] I'm going to go ahead
and do the laundry, okay?

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:04.629 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Dorm Mother, do you mind
if I use the washing machine

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
to do these clothes?

00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:07.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] Be my guest,
it's over here.

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Thanks, I appreciate it!

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's on top of things.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:12.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hate to say it, but we
probably should keep

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
the truth from her,
shouldn't we?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What truth?
[Nagisa] Well, you know...

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.909 position:5% line:83% align:start
The truth about how Sunohara is
madly in love with you, Okazaki.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh?
[thud]

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I can't believe it.
Is that true?

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.848 position:5% line:77% align:start
My brother came out of the
closet and he already has
a boyfriend?

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] No, it's not like that
at all! They aren't a couple!

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:34.919 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's actually totally one-sided!
Sunohara's for forcing
himself on Okazaki!

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.888 position:5% line:71% align:start
[gasp]
Oh no, I just told her
everything I was supposed
to keep secret, didn't I?!

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ooh... my heart.

00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:44.026 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you know, I think love
can come in different forms

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:45.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
for different people.

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.228 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, in the end,
who are we to say that

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:49.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
one love is more right
or wrong than another?

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
[nervous laugh]

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:54.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm floundering here, Okazaki!
You say something to too!

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:57.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, this is way too much fun.
I'm just going to watch.

00:02:58.703 --> 00:02:59.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:02.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
What am I going
to do with my brother?!

00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:07.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please don't hold this against
him, he can't help it.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know he's irresponsible
and full of flaws,

00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:13.348 position:5% line:83% align:start
but despite all that,
he's still a good brother to me.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Mei...
[Mei] Huh?

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you be my little sister?

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:21.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Huh?
[Nagisa] Yeah, I know.

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:24.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd give anything to have
a little sister like you, Mei.

00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:26.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa! Okazaki!

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing in my room?!

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:30.228 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aah! No way!

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:31.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] You aren't turning
this into your love nest?

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:33.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh no, that's not it at all!

00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:36.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
Never mind our love nest,
you've got a visitor.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:39.568 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] And it just so happens
to be a cute, young girl who
loves you very much.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?! Yahoo!

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.939 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm Mei Sunohara, pleased
to make your acquaintance!

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah! Oof!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
What the heck are
you doing here?!

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:50.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told you I was coming.
I called the other day.

00:03:50.977 --> 00:03:55.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] You called me?
[Tomoya] Uh, I guess I've got
a lot of explaining to do, huh?

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:03.253 position:5% line:77% align:start
So in short, you've been
spreading lies and playing
tricks on everyone here.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:04.754 position:5% line:89% align:start
One thing just led to another.

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:07.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're terrible! And here I was,
all stressed out because

00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:10.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought poor Sunohara was
suffering from unrequited love.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.129 position:5% line:77% align:start
I went to a lot of trouble
to buy this, but I guess it
will go to waste now.

00:04:15.228 --> 00:04:16.663 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you think?
Do you want it?

00:04:16.763 --> 00:04:18.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding?!

00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:20.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Nagisa,
you sure about this?

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:22.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm sure Mei
is no trouble at all,

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:24.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I'd love to spend some
more time with her.

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:27.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish I could have her stay,
but even if she's your sister,

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't have a girl sleeping
in the boys' dorm.

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:32.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should take
Furukawa up on her offer.

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:33.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:36.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks a lot, Nagisa.
I really appreciate it.

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:38.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please take good care of her.

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:39.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
[awe]

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:40.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:42.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey guys, I'm home!

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm here, too.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.854 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Okazaki, it's been
a while, hasn't it?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
And who do we have here?

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, excuse me, you're very
pretty, ma'am.

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's sweet of you to say that.

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:55.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
You must be Nagisa's
older sister, right?

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:57.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I'm her mom.

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! I'd never have guessed!

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:01.964 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] What's up? Sounds like
you guys are having a party.

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:06.334 position:5% line:77% align:start
Please, Father and Mother,
I have an important favor
to ask.

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you being
so formal, huh?

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:09.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
You want me to tell you
the legend behind

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:11.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
the mysterious scar on your ass?

00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, not even close!

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... do I really have
a scar like that?

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] You really didn't know?
If you can't find it yourself,

00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:20.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd be happy to point
it out to you.

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gross, Dad!
You're such a pervert!

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:25.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
Scar or no scar, I'm way too old
to be showing you my butt!

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
You sure know the right buttons
to press with her, don't you?

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:31.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tch. Should've had a son
instead of a daughter.

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:34.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it's all right with you, Mom,
could you check for me?

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:36.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want Dad looking for me,
but you're okay.

00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:39.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, Nagisa. It's fine.

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:41.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have any weird
scars on your butt, okay?

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:43.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dad, you meanie,
you lied to me again!

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:49.567 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ha. This is just Daddy's way
of reaching out to his little
girl, that's all.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
You guys are really close,
aren't you?

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:55.571 position:5% line:77% align:start
Cool, huh? This family has the
dumbest conversations in all
of Japan.

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:59.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, sorry about that, Mei!
I forgot to introduce you!

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.944 position:5% line:77% align:start
Um, right. This is Mei Sunohara.
Her big brother is one
of my classmates

00:06:03.044 --> 00:06:05.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
and she's come from
out of town to visit him.

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:07.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
He lives at the dorms,
so can she stay with us?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.817 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm Mei Sunohara,
it's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:14.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm Sanae, and of course we
would be more than happy
to have you, Mei.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.622 position:5% line:83% align:start
Name's Akio. I'm the most
handsome man in all of Japan,

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:19.223 position:5% line:89% align:start
and quite possibly the world.

00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:20.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
You two are such a great couple.

00:06:20.892 --> 00:06:23.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae is really pretty and
Akio's so cool.

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:25.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
I should give you an allowance.

00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:26.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
How does 100,000 yen
a week sound?

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:29.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have that
kind of money.

00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:31.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
Youhei's going to play
in a basketball game?

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.069 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's right. He's working
really hard to help me start
up a Drama Club at school.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, I'd love to see him play.

00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:40.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] If you don't mind, can
I stay here until the game?

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:42.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't have a problem with it,
but what about school?

00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:46.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] It's okay. We're on
break before exams right now.

00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:50.880 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, you heard her. We have
to do our best for Mei's too,
right Okazaki?

00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:53.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like I have no
choice but to play, now.

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:00.621 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo!

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:03.057 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi, Okazaki.

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:04.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bell's about to ring,
you know.

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're want to be Student
Council President,

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
you better not to be
late to class.

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:09.662 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm going to be late,
won't you be late, too?

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but I'm a delinquent,
so it's fine.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of logic is that?

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
[school bell]

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:19.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no way I'm going to
let us be late for class.

00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:22.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, hold on! L-Let go!

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me another
girl likes him now!

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
What? My sister wants
to come watch the game?

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now the pressure's really
on for us to win this thing.

00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:33.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
After all, you can't let your
little sister find out how
lame you really are.

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:39.383 position:5% line:71% align:start
[groan]
[Tomoya] Nagisa's no good
at sports and I can't lift
my right arm to shoot.

00:07:39.484 --> 00:07:41.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're gonna need
some powerful support.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:43.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Support?
Wait, you mean...?!

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:44.588 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:46.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Wha-?!
[Kyou] So, when's the game?

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.792 position:5% line:77% align:start
And if we win this thing,
do we really get Mr. Koumura
as an advisor?

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:52.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
The game's set for tomorrow
afternoon in the gym.

00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:56.464 position:5% line:77% align:start
I made the Choir Club promise
to come watch, so at least that
end of the plan worked out.

00:07:56.564 --> 00:07:57.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
The rest all depends on us.

00:07:58.099 --> 00:07:59.600 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not too reassuring, is he?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatever, let's just give
it our best shot.

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
Youhei, could you go buy
me a strawberry milk?

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:05.304 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure, you got it.

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:06.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
What am I? Your errand boy?

00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:09.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remember, basketball's all
about working as a team.

00:08:09.373 --> 00:08:10.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
The slaves need to- No, sorry!

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:13.711 position:5% line:77% align:start
I mean, the players need to
respect the team captain,
so that-

00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:16.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
Whatever. Just get me
that milk, okay?
[growling]

00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:18.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
And who made you the
team captain, huh?!

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:19.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara...

00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:20.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold on, let me finish!

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:22.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
Both soccer and basketball
require teamwork.

00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:25.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
How can a team operate under
this oppressive hierarchy?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll take a coffee
with milk, please.

00:08:26.854 --> 00:08:28.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is our friendship
a hierarchy, too?!

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:30.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it obvious?

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
Man, stupid hierarchies!

00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:36.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I hate you!

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:39.998 position:5% line:77% align:start
Tomoya, if you want me to play,
I've got a condition
for you, too.

00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:43.100 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Like what?
[Kyou] Well, meet up with
me at lunchtime

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I'll tell you what it is.

00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:47.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Just wait for me
in the classroom, okay?

00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:49.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] You're not going to
the club room for lunch today?

00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:52.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, Kyou told me to wait in the
classroom for some reason.

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:53.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Hmm.

00:08:54.842 --> 00:08:55.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah!

00:08:55.676 --> 00:08:56.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
What did you think I was dead?

00:08:56.776 --> 00:08:58.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
We just weren't expecting you.

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's something that you
and I need to talk about.

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:02.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna join you
for lunch, okay?

00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:06.118 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've been asking around and
everyone tells me you come
to class late all the time.

00:09:06.218 --> 00:09:08.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
As a friend, I feel like
I can't ignore the problem.

00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:10.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Seniors should
be role models, you know.

00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:12.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're setting a bad example.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:13.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? This isn't about you.

00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:15.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about me,
just go eat.

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:17.592 position:5% line:89% align:start
You little-!

00:09:17.692 --> 00:09:18.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
See what happens when
my aim is off?

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:20.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't jump at me like that.

00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:21.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who do you think you are,

00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:22.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
coming in here and
messing up our lunch?!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I didn't do anything to you.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then what do you call this?!

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look at them,
asking an underclassman

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
to come eat lunch in our room.
Give me a break.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.138 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't figure it out.
Which one do you think
she's going out with?

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:34.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:09:34.672 --> 00:09:36.807 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have no interest at all
in someone like Sunohara.

00:09:36.907 --> 00:09:38.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
Excuse me for being
someone like Sunohara.

00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:41.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara isn't the person
I came here to see.

00:09:41.177 --> 00:09:43.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's Okazaki. I heard he
was always late to class,

00:09:43.845 --> 00:09:45.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
so, I was going to scold him
about it. That's all.

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:47.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Hold on!
What do you think you're doing

00:09:47.748 --> 00:09:49.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
barging into someone
else's class?

00:09:49.384 --> 00:09:50.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't recall there being
a rule that says

00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:53.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
you can't eat in other people's
classrooms during break.

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:55.956 position:5% line:77% align:start
That doesn't give you the right
to come in here and start
a ruckus.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:58.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] You realize you're
causing us trouble, don't you?

00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:00.259 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you getting
so mad at me?

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec! Are you just jealous
because you like Okazaki?

00:10:03.328 --> 00:10:08.098 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wha-?! Ah- Come on, that's
ridiculous! Give me a break!

00:10:08.198 --> 00:10:10.900 position:5% line:77% align:start
So, does that mean you're going
out with someone right now
or what?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
No way! Why are you
asking me this?

00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:17.305 position:5% line:77% align:start
I see, in that case, no one
should be jealous if they see
me eating lunch with you.

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Makes sense, right?

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:21.708 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aah! Whatever! I get it!

00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:24.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
The point is, I made plans with
him first! It's your fault, too!

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:26.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
I asked you to have lunch with
me today,

00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:29.047 position:5% line:77% align:start
and you went out and bought
pastries! Come on,
we're leaving!

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:32.183 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I didn't know meeting
you at lunch meant you wanted
to eat together!

00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:33.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Well, it did!

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:36.853 position:5% line:77% align:start
I never got to finish
our conversation.
That's a real shame.

00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:40.022 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a sec, are you doing
this because you're interested
in Okazaki?

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:42.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, that isn't what
I had in mind at all.

00:10:43.658 --> 00:10:46.027 position:5% line:89% align:start
But, maybe... maybe that's it.

00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:49.629 position:5% line:77% align:start
I guess that would explain
why I'm feeling this way
all of a sudden.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's going on here?

00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:59.004 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] You're always eating
lunch with Nagisa and Kotomi
in the club room.

00:10:59.104 --> 00:11:02.006 position:5% line:77% align:start
We just thought it would be
nice if you spent time with
us for once.

00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:05.508 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Um, if it's too much
trouble, we don't want to
force you.

00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:08.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, that's fine,
it's no trouble, really.

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:09.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh good, I was worried.

00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:12.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
By the way, you said
something interesting back
in the classroom.

00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:15.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Me? Sunohara and Tomoyo
were the interesting ones.

00:11:15.648 --> 00:11:17.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
I said "interesting,"
not "annoying".

00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:20.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, you said you don't
have a girlfriend, right?

00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:23.756 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm surprised. You gave me
the impression that you
were dating Nagisa.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:25.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, Kyou.
What are you getting at here?

00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:28.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, nothing. You'll just have
to wait and see.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.063 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:56.247 --> 00:11:59.783 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Did Mei really say she
was going to come watch the
basketball game?

00:11:59.883 --> 00:12:04.053 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yep, she may not talk about it
much, but I can tell she's
really worried about you.

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:08.089 position:5% line:77% align:start
You think so? She didn't even
bother to stop by and see
me today.

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:10.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
She probably couldn't care
less about her big brother.

00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What? Are you sulking
because she's ignoring you?

00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:15.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I bet she just came
to go sightseeing or whatever.

00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:17.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ever since we were little,
she's always loved the city.

00:12:17.897 --> 00:12:19.432 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I wouldn't really
call this the city.

00:12:19.532 --> 00:12:22.267 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, but compared to
my hometown, this place
is a big deal.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.470 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, whatever. Beats having
her tagging along all the
time, right?

00:12:25.569 --> 00:12:28.971 position:5% line:77% align:start
[laughing]
Give me a break. It's obvious
that you miss her.

00:12:29.072 --> 00:12:30.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
[knocking]
Huh?

00:12:30.273 --> 00:12:31.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Hi there!

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
Speak of the Devil.

00:12:32.707 --> 00:12:34.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
That girl, what does she want,

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
coming to harass
me all the time?

00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:42.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, hi Okazaki.
I thought I'd find you here.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:43.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Who, me?
[Mei] Yep!

00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:46.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae and Akio wanted to invite
you over for dinner tonight,

00:12:46.386 --> 00:12:48.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
so they asked me to hunt you
down and pass the message along.

00:12:48.954 --> 00:12:51.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Oh, and Youhei...
[Youhei] Oh, yeah, what's up?

00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:55.292 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] This takes up too much
space, so I'm going to leave
it here, okay? See ya'!

00:12:58.894 --> 00:12:59.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah!

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:01.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is too much! Too much!

00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:06.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right! Now, we're going
to win this game! Got it?

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:09.169 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You're fired up
all of a sudden.
[Youhei] Did something happen?

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:12.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
Someone from the basketball
team said something rude to her.

00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:14.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
so, I think she's looking
for revenge now.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.577 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yep! He said I was "...degrading
myself by teaming up with
a bunch of low-lives,"

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:19.743 position:5% line:89% align:start
or something like that.

00:13:19.844 --> 00:13:21.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
God, that pisses me off!

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:25.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, is it a foul to slam
the ball into someone's face?

00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:27.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, uh, yeah,
I'm afraid so.

00:13:27.383 --> 00:13:30.552 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Tch.
[Kotomi] Kyou's really
intense today, isn't she?

00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:32.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll never hear the
end of this if we lose.

00:13:32.387 --> 00:13:35.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm starting to think we picked
the wrong person after all.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um... Just make sure you don't
get hurt out there, okay?

00:13:39.493 --> 00:13:41.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it.
I'll be fine.

00:13:41.528 --> 00:13:44.863 position:5% line:77% align:start
[student] I don't get it. Why is
the basketball team playing the
Drama Club?

00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:46.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows, but it might
be fun to watch.

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:50.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it. Why do we have
to watch a basketball game, Rie?

00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:53.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't care what Sunohara told
you, even if they win,

00:13:53.537 --> 00:13:55.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
it still has nothing
to do with us.

00:13:55.637 --> 00:14:00.475 position:5% line:77% align:start
I suppose it doesn't. But
Sunohara insisted we come
no matter what.

00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:01.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
What grade are you in?

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:02.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're all freshmen, of course.

00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:05.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
What? You mean we're playing
a bunch of rookies?

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:08.814 position:5% line:77% align:start
What did you expect?
Wouldn't be much of a game
if you played our A Team.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll see how long that
confidence of yours holds up.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:14.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
The game will be played 3-on-3
for twenty minutes.

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:16.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
There will be no timeouts.

00:14:16.154 --> 00:14:18.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
All other basketball
rules apply. Got it?

00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:20.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oogami's your advisor, right?

00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:23.159 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he finds out about this,
there's going to be hell to pay.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:25.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's worth the risk
to see you play again.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Um, Nagisa?

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's up? Is something wrong?

00:14:30.498 --> 00:14:33.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure it's okay
for me to be at your school?

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:35.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it's fine.
And even if it's not,

00:14:35.502 --> 00:14:39.472 position:5% line:77% align:start
I doubt anyone will notice since
they'll all be focusing on the
basketball game.

00:14:39.572 --> 00:14:42.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I don't think
I caught your name.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm Youhei Sunohara's
younger sister, Mei.

00:14:44.875 --> 00:14:46.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for being friends
with my bro.

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:49.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! Uh, sure.
It's nothing, really.

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:51.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Kotomi,
it's nice to meet you.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.950 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey guys, you might want to
watch. It looks like the game's
starting now.

00:15:05.124 --> 00:15:06.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
[whistle]

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:09.160 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn he's fast!

00:15:09.928 --> 00:15:11.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara!

00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:12.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Kyou!

00:15:17.967 --> 00:15:19.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] All right!
[boys] Eh...

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.803 position:5% line:71% align:start
[cheering]
[Tomoya] Nice shot!
[Youhei] She has lots
of practice

00:15:21.903 --> 00:15:24.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
from throwing all those
dictionaries at me every day.

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:26.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, flip the
scoreboard already.

00:15:26.106 --> 00:15:27.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, right!

00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:30.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Wait, that was
worth three points?

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
Normally a shot is only
worth two points,

00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:36.682 position:5% line:77% align:start
but if a player makes it
from more than 20 feet away,
it's worth three points.

00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:39.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I don't know much
about basketball.

00:15:40.952 --> 00:15:43.186 position:5% line:89% align:start
That... That was luck.

00:15:46.789 --> 00:15:48.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dammit, I can't shake her off!

00:15:49.058 --> 00:15:50.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:51.327 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tch!

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara!

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:56.964 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Kyou!

00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:02.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:16:02.968 --> 00:16:05.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Nice shot, Kyou!

00:16:05.237 --> 00:16:06.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
In that case...

00:16:06.304 --> 00:16:08.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to keep
her covered!

00:16:08.105 --> 00:16:09.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
You think I wasn't
expecting that?

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara, here!

00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:13.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, shoot! I dare you!

00:16:13.743 --> 00:16:14.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:16.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:21.550 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Alright!
[Tomoya] Nice, Sunohara!
[cheering]

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.185 position:5% line:77% align:start
[captain] Come on, wake up!
You guys can't hold back
against them.

00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:26.519 position:5% line:77% align:start
[captain] Show them what
you're made of.
[boys] Uh... right!

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.389 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>At this rate,</i>
 <i>he'll probably bring in</i>
 <i>the regular members soon.</i>

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:33.157 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>If we want to win this,</i>
 <i>we'll have to get a big</i>
 <i>lead before then.</i>

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:36.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hn!

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.228 position:5% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:16:39.596 --> 00:16:40.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:42.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:43.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
There!

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:45.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aw...

00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:50.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Stay cool.
[both] Right!

00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:54.107 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Harada] They're really great.
I can't believe it.
[Youhei] Come on, let's go!

00:16:54.207 --> 00:16:56.542 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Rie] And they're playing the
basketball team, too.
[Youhei] Yo! Pass!

00:16:56.643 --> 00:16:58.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Kyou!
[Kyou] Thanks, Tomoya!

00:16:58.344 --> 00:16:59.646 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Okay, now!

00:16:59.746 --> 00:17:00.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Kyou, shoot!

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes!
[loud cheering]

00:17:08.285 --> 00:17:09.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who are they?

00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:11.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't ask me why,
but for some reason

00:17:11.186 --> 00:17:13.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm really popular with
the underclassmen girls.

00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.024 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Youhei, over here.
[captain] Okazaki still can't
raise his right arm

00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:17.625 position:5% line:77% align:start
[captain] much higher than
his shoulder.
[Youhei] Take it, Kyou!

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:19.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
He can still make lay-ups
from the left side of the court,

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:20.662 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if you keep an eye
out for that,

00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:22.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
he shouldn't be a real problem.

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:24.797 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just make sure to keep the
pressure on Sunohara
and Fujibayashi

00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:28.166 position:5% line:77% align:start
so that they don't have any
room to take a good shot
at the basket.

00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:30.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright!
[cheering]

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:31.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
[captain] Changing players.

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:33.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
All freshmen, off the court.

00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:34.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:17:35.072 --> 00:17:36.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it,
just leave it to us.

00:17:36.607 --> 00:17:38.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like they're breaking
out the big guns now.

00:17:38.775 --> 00:17:40.942 position:5% line:83% align:start
Good, that's what
I was waiting for.

00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:42.944 position:5% line:83% align:start
You gonna make it?
You don't look so good.

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:46.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
What, are you kidding? I'm just
now getting warmed up.

00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:53.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Five more minutes...

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:55.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
Up by eleven points...

00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:12.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dammit!

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop right there!

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:15.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah!

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.388 position:5% line:89% align:start
Argh, come on!

00:18:43.324 --> 00:18:44.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
[student a] They're catching
up fast!

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:46.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
[student b] Guess they can't
stand up to the real players.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.195 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Mei] How much more time
do they have left?
[Tomoya] Sunohara,
don't force it.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.130 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] About one minute and
twenty seconds to go.
[Youhei] Dammit!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.031 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Watch your defense!
[Kotomi] They're about to
catch up.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:55.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] It's a one
point difference.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Sunohara's
out of breath!

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:01.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] They've taken the lead!

00:19:01.204 --> 00:19:02.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Only twenty seconds left!

00:19:02.905 --> 00:19:05.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, guys, you can do it!

00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:08.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Ug, I can't keep</i>
 <i>this up. I'm running on empty.</i>

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:14.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Come to think of it,</i>
 <i>why am I trying so hard anyway?</i>

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.183 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nice pass!

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Here goes nothing!</i>

00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:21.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not so fast!

00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:26.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Who am I kidding?</i>
 <i>We can't win this.</i>

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>These guys practice every day.</i>

00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:31.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>And what about me?</i>

00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:34.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I spent the last two years</i>
 <i>wasting my life away.</i>

00:19:34.497 --> 00:19:36.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I knew how this was</i>
 <i>going to end.</i>

00:19:36.898 --> 00:19:38.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>This is stupid...</i>

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I shouldn't have</i>
 <i>agreed to this.</i>

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:43.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It just makes me</i>
 <i>feel miserable.</i>

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.805 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>So miserable...</i>

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:48.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, shoot the ball!

00:19:56.513 --> 00:19:57.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>But still...</i>

00:20:02.518 --> 00:20:07.054 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Now there's a place that</i>
 <i>even someone like me wants</i>
 <i>to fight for!</i>

00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:14.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
[whistle]

00:20:14.593 --> 00:20:17.028 position:5% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:20:22.332 --> 00:20:23.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:25.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:26.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yay!

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, that was really amazing!

00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:33.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
T-They did it.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't believe they really won.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Oogami] Hey!

00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:38.679 position:5% line:83% align:start
What the hell's going
on in here?

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:39.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eep! It's Oogami.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Run for it!
[captain] Hey!

00:20:42.047 --> 00:20:43.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
You had that look in your eye.

00:20:43.817 --> 00:20:45.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe you can still
play after all.

00:20:46.885 --> 00:20:48.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding me?

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:02.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for taking care of me.
I had a great time!

00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:04.431 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish you could've
stayed longer.

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:05.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hate to see you go.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:07.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mom and Dad said you're
welcome any time,

00:21:07.468 --> 00:21:09.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
so please come visit
us again, okay?

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:12.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your big brother was pretty cool
out there today, huh?

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:16.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well... you were kind of running
out of steam at the end there.

00:21:16.507 --> 00:21:17.341 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyuh!

00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:19.176 position:5% line:89% align:start
But, yeah, you were pretty cool!

00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:20.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
Y-Yeah!
[giggling]

00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] I'm sorry I had to leave
so quickly this time,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I hope I can come back for
a longer visit sometime soon.

00:21:26.648 --> 00:21:28.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:30.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
Be careful going home.

00:21:30.318 --> 00:21:31.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Kay!

00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:37.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:40.826 --> 00:21:42.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
There she goes.

00:21:42.627 --> 00:21:43.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
Time sure flies, huh?

00:21:44.061 --> 00:21:46.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's all right.
You'll see her again, soon.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
She said she wanted to come
back, didn't she?

00:21:51.734 --> 00:21:55.504 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] I wonder if the Choir
Club will really hand over
Mr. Koumura after all?

00:21:55.604 --> 00:21:57.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, whatever
happens happens.

00:21:57.472 --> 00:22:00.074 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] So, ready to go?
Kyou and the others
planned a party

00:22:00.174 --> 00:22:02.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
in celebration of your win over
the basketball team.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Really? Where?

00:22:04.143 --> 00:22:05.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] In your room.

00:22:05.245 --> 00:22:06.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Why is it in my room?

00:22:06.513 --> 00:22:08.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You mean nobody
told you about it?

00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:10.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Nobody said a thing!

00:23:52.459 --> 00:23:56.495 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] The future?
[Kyou] Yeah, like what are you
planning to do after graduation?

00:23:56.597 --> 00:23:58.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Oh, come on.
You're kidding me, right?

00:23:58.598 --> 00:24:00.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're a senior and you haven't
even thought about this?

00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:02.001 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Come back to me later.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
What about you two?

00:24:03.134 --> 00:24:04.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] It might sound strange,

00:24:04.603 --> 00:24:06.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I was thinking of becoming
a kindergarten teacher.

00:24:06.637 --> 00:24:09.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] As for me, I was
considering nursing school.

00:24:09.172 --> 00:24:10.573 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hmm.
