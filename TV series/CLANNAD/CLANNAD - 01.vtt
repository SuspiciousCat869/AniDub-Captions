[Tomoya] <i>I hate this town.</i>

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It's too filled with memories</i>
 <i>I'd rather forget.</i>

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.844 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>I go to school everyday,</i>
 <i>hang out with my friends,</i>
 <i>and then I go home.</i>

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:29.348 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>There's no place I'd rather not</i>
 <i>go ever again.</i>

00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:34.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I wonder if anything</i>
 <i>will ever change.</i>

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:36.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Will that day ever come?</i>

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:52.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anpan!

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Do you like
this school?

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:59.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say that I love
it very, very much.

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:04.043 position:5% line:77% align:start
But soon everything
changes, well, at least
it does eventually.

00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:06.478 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>A girl I don't know...</i>

00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:08.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>But she isn't talking to me.</i>

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:13.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>She's probably talking</i>
 <i>to someone in her heart.</i>

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:17.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Fun things,
happy things, they'll all...

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.455 position:5% line:83% align:start
They'll all eventually change
someday, you know?

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
But can you still
love this place?

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:27.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Just go and find more.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
All you have to do is find other
fun and happy things.
It's not so hard.

00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:47.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's go.

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:56.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>And so we begin...</i>

00:01:56.316 --> 00:02:00.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>...on a long, long</i>
 <i>upward climb.</i>

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:36.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Student] I haven't seen it
in a long time.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about it, Sunohara?!
You come to your senses?

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:46.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
You and your CD player turned
way up, day after day...

00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:49.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I can't get myself going
until I hear that song.

00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
Scrum!

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:54.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki! Don't just stand
there, help me!

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.313 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I don't want to turn into
a lamebrain like you.

00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:00.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can be really coldhearted,
do you know that?!

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:15.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Grunting, Screaming]

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:20.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Misae] Quiet, quiet!

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:22.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you guys knock it off?!

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:25.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
Those stupid kids!

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm the one all the darn
neighbors complain to, you know!

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>It's not easy being</i>
 <i>Dorm Mother, is it?</i>

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:35.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Misae, you should have
come sooner to save me.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're just as much
at fault, I'll bet.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.947 position:5% line:77% align:start
I hope you've learned
your lesson after that
little assault!

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am...

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:45.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Damn those rubgy
team jerkoffs...

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
No one can hear you if
you whisper.

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:50.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Damn those rugby
team jerkoffs!"

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rugby player] Who said that?!

00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:55.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to get
me killed?!

00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:56.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're such a wimp,
you know that?

00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well if it were just one of
those guys, I wouldn't give in.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.797 position:5% line:89% align:start
There are just too many of them.

00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:06.035 position:5% line:77% align:start
But just wait and see.
I'll get them good just
before our graduation day.

00:05:06.135 --> 00:05:10.038 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then, Okazaki, as my best
friend, I'll let you
watch my back!

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:11.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lucky me! I got you covered!

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:12.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're not gonna do it!

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
But to be honest with you,
I'm on their side, than yours.

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:16.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
Since when?!

00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:17.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
That day when-

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:19.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rugby player] Keep it down,
will ya?!

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:23.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shall I kick him back?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:28.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>And so, this day ends</i>
 <i>like all the others do.</i>

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, can I have some tea
or something?

00:05:30.287 --> 00:05:32.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm all out.

00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:35.791 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>With no particular</i>
 <i>objective, and nothing to feel</i>
 <i>passionate about.</i>

00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:37.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pretty Please!

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:41.929 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Just another</i>
 <i>unexceptional day.</i>
[Youhei] Begging won't get any
tea to appear!

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:48.434 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Voice] <i>This is a world that</i>
 <i>has ended. Nothing is born,</i>
 <i>nothing dies.</i>

00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:51.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Not even passing time exists.</i>

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:58.642 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>If I were looking for somewhere</i>
 <i>to be born, I don't think I</i>
 <i>should choose this world.</i>

00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:03.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>And in this world, such as it</i>
 <i>is, there is someone.</i>

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.915 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I wonder if she can see me?</i>

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:09.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I haven't been born</i>
 <i>into this world.</i>

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:15.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>A girl living alone in a world</i>
 <i>that has ended.</i>

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:21.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>A girl living in this empty</i>
 <i>and still world.</i>

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>For some reason, I am bothered</i>
 <i>by that girl.</i>

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Student] Okazaki and Sunohara
aren't here yet.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.408 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wonder what they're planning
to do about going on to college
and entrance exams?

00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:40.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're seniors, you know?

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:42.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forget about those two!

00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:46.047 position:5% line:77% align:start
We don't need to waste a moment
of our lives worrying over those
two bums.

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:54.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Uh, Okazaki...

00:06:54.587 --> 00:06:57.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? What's the matter?
What is it?

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like you're a little late
again today, aren't you?

00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:01.525 position:5% line:89% align:start
So?

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:05.229 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, I just think you should
come to school on time every
day, that's all.

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:08.731 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh? You're starting to sound
like the class leader or
something, you know that?

00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:12.968 position:5% line:77% align:start
But... It's not any "or
something." I really am the
class leader.

00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:17.372 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Student] Hey, Okazaki, don't
make her cry. You'll have her
big sister rushing in!

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.807 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't worry! I'm not
crying at all!

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:23.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, I got it. Let's just see
how I do tomorrow.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:27.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well then, uh, I'll read your
fortune for tomorrow!

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:30.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fortunetelling is
my hobby, you see.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:34.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh boy...

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
It says you're going
to be late tomorrow.

00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:39.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you trying to make me mad?!

00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:43.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's what the cards say!
I think this is your future.

00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:45.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think that's my future?

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:49.930 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] On your way to school,
you'll have a romantic meeting
with a sweet girl.

00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.566 position:5% line:77% align:start
You'll forget all about the
time, and that's why you're
going to be late.

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:55.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seems to be awfully
specific, isn't it?

00:07:55.702 --> 00:07:58.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
Call it a maiden's inspiration.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:00.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, Tomoya Okazaki!

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:05.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sister, what is it?!

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:07.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh...

00:08:07.178 --> 00:08:10.981 position:5% line:77% align:start
You have got some nerve
picking on my little sister,
you fleabrain!

00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:12.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna beat you!

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:14.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jeez, will you relax?
I was only talking to her!

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:17.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, Sis.
He wasn't picking on me.

00:08:19.754 --> 00:08:21.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, in that case...

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:25.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Were you having Ryou read
your fortune or something?

00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:30.129 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, she says I'll have
a romantic meeting with
a sweet girl tomorrow.

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:32.365 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:33.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, what's up with that face?

00:08:33.732 --> 00:08:35.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nothing at all, loverboy...

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.235 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, good luck!

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:48.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Now,
where shall I eat this?

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:48.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Student a] A ghost?!

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:50.379 position:5% line:89% align:start
They say that a ghost appears.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know, the ghost of that girl

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
killed in that traffic accident.

00:08:53.647 --> 00:08:54.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Student a] They were
probably seeing things.

00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:56.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>A ghost, huh?</i>
[Student b] It's true!

00:08:56.516 --> 00:08:58.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Student b] They say she's cute.

00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:03.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yo! You alone?

00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:06.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should eat in the
classroom with your friends.

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:10.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Anpan?</i>

00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:11.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you listening to me?

00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:12.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm so sorry,

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:15.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm in the middle
of my lunchtime meal.

00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:17.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] So I see...

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
[slurp]

00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:35.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
What did...
So, what did you want?

00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:40.718 position:5% line:77% align:start
Nothing, really. I was just
wondering why you're here
eating lunch alone.

00:09:40.818 --> 00:09:43.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me ask you, do you like
this school very much?

00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:45.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, no, not especially...

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:48.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
I love this school
very, very much.

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:53.062 position:5% line:77% align:start
I used to have friends I could
talk to and teachers I was
close to,

00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:54.430 position:5% line:89% align:start
but now it's just...

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did something happen?

00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:59.566 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's just that I was out
of school for a long
time last year,

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
so everything's different.

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:02.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I...

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:04.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
...have to take the year over?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, I'm a repeater.
[giggle]

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:13.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
Everybody that I knew has
graduated and gone on to
their lives,

00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:16.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
so there isn't anyone
I know here anymore.

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:19.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's kind of weird, but I feel
a little like Rip Van Winkle.

00:10:21.084 --> 00:10:22.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:25.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've only just met you
and I'm telling you all this.

00:10:25.288 --> 00:10:28.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see. So, that's why you
were talking to yourself?

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:31.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
But weren't you in any
of the clubs or anything?

00:10:31.158 --> 00:10:34.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I really wanted to join
the school's Drama Club,

00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:38.331 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I don't know. Physically I'm
weak, so I can't be very active,

00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:40.165 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I don't think
I'd get any parts.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's the case, then just
do as much as you can.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why not at least check out the
Drama Club room after school?

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:46.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:10:46.537 --> 00:10:47.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, look!

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:50.073 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're looking this way.

00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:53.543 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] If you're always
looking so sad, you won't
make any friends.

00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:55.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
Try smiling and waving at them.

00:10:55.512 --> 00:10:58.280 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Ah!
[Tomoya] Come on, just try it.
A big smile!

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:02.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
[nervous laugh]

00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:05.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] They didn't notice you.

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:09.222 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] I guess I don't
stand out much, not even
in my classes.

00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:13.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
[motor sounds]

00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:15.760 position:5% line:77% align:start
[boy] This should
be interesting.
[Nagisa] What could it be?

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Boy, this is great!
What a blast!

00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:25.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, what's all
the excitement?

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a raid, I suppose.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those rough kids from
another high school

00:11:28.804 --> 00:11:30.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
came riding in on their bikes.

00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:32.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey! What are you doing
leaning on my head?!

00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:33.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get off of me!

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?
[Youhei] Ooh, what's this?

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:37.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Is she planning
to lecture them?

00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:50.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Why is this happening?

00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:53.625 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] This school has
the highest rate of kids
going on to college in town.

00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:55.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are guys who are
turned off by that.

00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:57.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what? You're gonna help her?

00:11:57.894 --> 00:12:00.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't just sit back and watch.

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:01.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl a] You don't have
to worry about Tomoyo.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo?
[girl a] Don't you know her?

00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:06.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
She just transferred
here as a junior.

00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:07.902 position:5% line:89% align:start
Her name is Tomoyo Sakagami.

00:12:08.002 --> 00:12:09.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's really super strong.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you butt in, you're only
going to be getting in her way.

00:12:12.172 --> 00:12:13.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But
she's outnumbered...

00:12:13.873 --> 00:12:16.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want any
unnecessary fuss out of you.

00:12:16.309 --> 00:12:18.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Get out of here
or you'll get hurt.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
I won't trouble you
if you all just leave peaceably.

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:23.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You wouldn't want
to get hurt, would you?

00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:26.551 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't take me for a fool!

00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ooh!

00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:32.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:42.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
[awe]
[punk] Don't take me for a fool!

00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:55.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl a] Oh my gosh, she did it!
[girl b] She's so super cool!

00:12:55.272 --> 00:12:56.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, what in the world was that?

00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:01.811 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, who was she? Is she a
transfer student or something?

00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:04.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
Apparently not much different
from your situation,

00:13:04.347 --> 00:13:05.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
but she's very popular.

00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:07.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess it depends
on how you handle things.

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:10.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
When you put it that way,
maybe you're right.

00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:12.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Yeah, right...</i>

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:14.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Who am I to be lecturing her?</i>

00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:19.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I have to go.

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:20.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, y-yes...

00:13:20.793 --> 00:13:23.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, thank you very much.

00:13:25.196 --> 00:13:27.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm Tomoya Okazaki
of Class D.

00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:30.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
And my name is Nagisa Furukawa
of Class B.

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:31.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's very nice to meet you.

00:13:31.934 --> 00:13:35.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, same here, Tomoya Okazaki.

00:13:35.571 --> 00:13:37.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Hey, Okazaki...

00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:41.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to come
with me after this class.

00:13:43.612 --> 00:13:45.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Faked it?
[Youhei] Yeah,

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's no way a girl
can beat a guy.

00:13:47.414 --> 00:13:51.618 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll bet you paid them to let
you win, so you could
gain popularity.

00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:55.120 position:5% line:77% align:start
Or maybe you didn't
offer money...
Something else, perhaps.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.123 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe you're the kind of girl
who would offer a guy a little
bit of her you-know-what.

00:13:59.223 --> 00:14:00.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
[whispering]
Who are those guys?

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:01.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
Delinquent seniors.

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:03.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think they're Sunohara
and Okazaki.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is your day. I wasn't
going to take on and fight

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:07.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
any of the students
at this school,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it looks like I'll just
have to make an exception

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:11.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
in your case.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're so cute,
bluffing like that.

00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:14.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll bet your knees are quaking.

00:14:15.036 --> 00:14:17.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I want to make
this self defense.

00:14:17.405 --> 00:14:18.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come at me.

00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:21.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ha! Don't be so
sure of yourself.

00:14:22.775 --> 00:14:25.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it up!

00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:27.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>At that moment,</i>
 <i>I suddenly remembered...</i>

00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:30.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>In this town, there was once</i>
 <i>an unbelievably strong girl</i>

00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:32.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>who was also very beautiful.</i>

00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:36.853 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>She went around pounding</i>
 <i>dumb guys who bothered</i>
 <i>ordinary citizens.</i>

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:38.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what I always
heard, at least.

00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:40.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish you'd told
me that earlier.

00:14:40.723 --> 00:14:43.358 position:5% line:71% align:start
[girl c] She sure is cool!
[girl d] He's such a wimp!
[Tomoyo] And don't come
back again.

00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:45.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn her!

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>The third floor</i>
 <i>of the old school building...</i>

00:14:49.563 --> 00:14:52.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>This is where the cultural</i>
 <i>club rooms were, I think.</i>

00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:56.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I guess she's decided to join.</i>

00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:00.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hamburger?

00:15:00.406 --> 00:15:01.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me!

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:17.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, it's you.

00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:19.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
You came here, too?

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:20.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:15:20.321 --> 00:15:22.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you doing with
your hand up there?

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's nothing. Sorry.

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:30.929 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'd forgotten,
the Drama Club has been
on hiatus since March.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:34.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I heard that they'd
always had few members.

00:15:38.602 --> 00:15:41.571 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, yeah, but
"hiatus" means they can
get going again

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:43.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
once all the
requirements are met.

00:15:43.473 --> 00:15:45.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder if maybe...

00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:47.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you just hang
in there a little bit longer?

00:15:47.609 --> 00:15:48.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll help you.

00:15:48.744 --> 00:15:51.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can I ask you a question?

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:54.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I don't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

00:15:54.247 --> 00:15:56.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
You only just met me
a little while ago.

00:15:56.717 --> 00:15:58.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why am I being nice?

00:15:58.485 --> 00:16:00.186 position:5% line:89% align:start
I dunno... Good question.

00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:03.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:12.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
[yawn]

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
[woman] Sit down and eat.

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:26.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I'll leave you here.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, so long.

00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:29.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Uh, Okazaki...

00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:34.079 position:5% line:77% align:start
My home is actually upstairs
in the bakery on the other side
of the park down there.

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:36.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you come and
visit us sometime?

00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:37.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'll see...

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:16:41.017 --> 00:16:42.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Anyone here?

00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:47.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] That's our new
item this week.

00:16:47.957 --> 00:16:50.259 position:5% line:83% align:start
It would just thrill
me if you'd take a bite.

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:52.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Is that her sister?</i>
 <i>Or her mother?</i>

00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:56.296 position:5% line:77% align:start
[giggle]
You needn't pay for it;
it's just a leftover.

00:16:56.397 --> 00:16:58.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
The concept behind it is
the word "calmness."

00:16:58.932 --> 00:17:00.768 position:5% line:89% align:start
Calmness?

00:17:00.868 --> 00:17:03.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay then, I think I'll
give one a try.

00:17:04.704 --> 00:17:06.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
[crunch]

00:17:08.206 --> 00:17:10.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] There's a rice
cracker inside.

00:17:10.107 --> 00:17:12.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
I call it the crispy-crackly
rice cracker bun.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>This may be the</i>
 <i>strangest name for a pastry,</i>

00:17:14.512 --> 00:17:16.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>but is even stranger</i>
 <i>than the name is.</i>

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
It is, isn't it?

00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:23.985 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a winning idea!

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
You don't like the bun?

00:17:27.822 --> 00:17:28.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
What isn't wrong?

00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:30.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to have to
be really honest.

00:17:30.357 --> 00:17:32.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
This thing is a total disaster.

00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:33.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:17:34.628 --> 00:17:36.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it tasty?

00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:38.029 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's a problem with
the taste, yes,

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it's just too hard to eat.

00:17:39.632 --> 00:17:42.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's obvious to me why these
travesties haven't sold yet.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guh!

00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:45.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffle]

00:17:45.703 --> 00:17:49.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't like my pastries...
My homemade pastries...

00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:54.443 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] J-Just a...
[Sanae] So, it's plain to
see why they haven't sold!

00:17:54.544 --> 00:17:56.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Like mother
like daughter, I guess.

00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:58.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope her father
is normal, at least.

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:01.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Hey!
[Tomoya] What is it?

00:18:01.782 --> 00:18:03.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>It was worse than</i>
 <i>anything I could imagine.</i>

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:05.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said something
you shouldn't have.

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:08.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] You shoulda just said it
was delicious and eaten it.

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:10.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where's your sense of
"duty" and "charity"?

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:14.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
I swear, you kids these days,
you have no manners at all.

00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:17.695 position:5% line:77% align:start
Truth is always cruel if you
just shove it in her face...
How pitiful!

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:20.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
People living around here
eat her pastries saying
they're good.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.465 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's an unwritten rule!

00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:22.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] It's the law!

00:18:22.432 --> 00:18:23.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, you have to follow it, too,

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:24.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
you got that, wiseguy?

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:25.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll beat you to such a pulp

00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
they won't be able
to recognize you!

00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:28.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey kid,

00:18:28.102 --> 00:18:28.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're wearing the exact same

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
uniform as our daughter.

00:18:30.538 --> 00:18:31.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't, by any
chance, happen

00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:33.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
to be a friend of Nagisa's?

00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:35.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should have told
me sooner, numbskull!

00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:39.679 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry that we showed
Nagisa's friend such
shameful conduct.

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:41.046 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ha, ha! Don't worry, Sanae.

00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:42.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
He doesn't look too smart,

00:18:42.347 --> 00:18:43.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
so he's probably
forgotten everything.

00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:45.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right? Hyuk!

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:47.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mustn't say such things
to one of our guests, hunny!

00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:50.154 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Akio] Whatever the case, we
should be celebrating.
[Tomoya] <i>Why is this happening</i>
 <i>to me?</i>

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:54.090 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] To think Nagisa
would bring a friend home so
soon after starting school!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what's more,
it's a boy, Akio.

00:18:56.693 --> 00:18:57.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's that?!

00:18:57.794 --> 00:18:58.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
A boy, you say?

00:18:58.962 --> 00:19:00.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Did he just realize it?</i>

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:02.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe this charming lad
is her new boyfriend.

00:19:02.798 --> 00:19:05.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmph! You think I'm going to
give Nagisa to such a wimp?

00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:07.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get outta here, kid. Get out!

00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:09.102 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Then, I guess
I'll be leaving...
[Akio] Go on!

00:19:09.202 --> 00:19:10.804 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, you call yourself a man?!

00:19:10.904 --> 00:19:12.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, if you're really
are a man,

00:19:12.204 --> 00:19:13.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
you should grab the girl
you love and run.

00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:17.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, there's no way
I'd let you have her.

00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:19.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well look, you've all
become friends already.

00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:23.413 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course we are! I wouldn't
treat my daughter's friend
as if they were a stranger.

00:19:23.514 --> 00:19:24.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:19:24.982 --> 00:19:27.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong there, pal?
Why the stupid look?

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:31.019 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I just thought
I probably shouldn't get
involved with this family.

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:35.557 position:5% line:77% align:start
See, we've gotten friendly
enough to even give each
other a little sarcasm.

00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:38.392 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a minute, how rude of us.
We don't even know your
name yet.

00:19:38.492 --> 00:19:41.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Okazaki, Tomoya Okazaki.

00:19:41.327 --> 00:19:43.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sounds like a
sissy's name to me.

00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:45.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you change
it to Ginga Okazaki?

00:19:45.598 --> 00:19:48.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's nice! Well then, would
you mind if I call you Ginga?

00:19:48.934 --> 00:19:51.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
While you're at it, change your
last name to Daiuchuu!

00:19:51.502 --> 00:19:53.471 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ginga Daiuchuu!
Isn't it a great name?

00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:56.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Tomoya Okazaki,
not Ginga!

00:19:56.273 --> 00:19:58.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
Man, aren't you a picky fella?

00:19:58.508 --> 00:20:01.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae, can't you think
of a better name for him?

00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:02.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have an idea...

00:20:02.811 --> 00:20:05.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
What if we add a little magical
something after his name?

00:20:05.848 --> 00:20:09.851 position:5% line:77% align:start
Something that shows his
greatness and that he transcends
the flow of time and space.

00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:12.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about
Tomoya Okazaki Eternal?

00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:14.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's just great!

00:20:14.253 --> 00:20:16.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
Call yourself that from
now on, Ethanol.

00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:18.189 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's different...

00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:39.240 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Thanks, I can find
my way from here.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry my family
and I kept you so late.

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:44.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It was a
little strange...

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
To think there was
a family like this...

00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:49.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
You all get along so well.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] You think so?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think we're actually
quite ordinary.

00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:55.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] See you tomorrow.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, goodnight, Okazaki.

00:20:57.855 --> 00:21:02.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
[tv] On the 27th, Earth will be
within 55,750,000 km of Mars.

00:21:02.893 --> 00:21:04.827 position:5% line:77% align:start
[tv] As you know, Mars is in
an orbit just outside that
of Earth.

00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:08.797 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Dad, if you're going
to sleep, you should move
to your bed.

00:21:08.898 --> 00:21:10.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, Dad, wake up.

00:21:14.935 --> 00:21:17.403 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Naoyuki] Oh, well look at this,
will you?
[Tomoya] Tch.

00:21:17.503 --> 00:21:21.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems that I've caused you
such trouble again, Tomoya.

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:30.848 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>My mother died in</i>
 <i>a traffic accident when</i>
 <i>I was little.</i>

00:21:30.948 --> 00:21:34.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Because of that I guess, my dad</i>
 <i>has been drinking and gambling,</i>

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>and hasn't been working much.</i>

00:21:45.927 --> 00:21:47.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] If you'd like...

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:54.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll take you to a special
place in town...

00:21:56.601 --> 00:22:00.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
A place where all your
wishes come true.

00:22:02.473 --> 00:22:04.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure...

00:23:42.152 --> 00:23:44.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki, let's cut
school today.

00:23:44.754 --> 00:23:47.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's Saturday and school's
just half a day today.

00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:52.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
I'll be done real soon.

00:23:52.493 --> 00:23:54.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you go wait
for me in the club room?

00:23:56.063 --> 00:23:58.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good, not even a scratch.

00:23:58.364 --> 00:24:00.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like I won't have to
charge you for any repairs.

00:24:00.834 --> 00:24:02.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, it's all set!

00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:07.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's nothing at all.
Forget I said anything.

00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:10.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you alone?
