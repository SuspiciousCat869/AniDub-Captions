You and I did meet, we
met when we were children.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
That means that all this
time, you've known it was me.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it.
Why didn't you say anything?

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] The first time you came
to visit me in the library...

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:24.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was so happy.
I didn't know what to say.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought, after
all these years,

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
you had finally come back...

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:31.431 position:5% line:89% align:start
that you finally remembered.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then, I realized that
you didn't know who I was.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
You weren't the same
boy I knew from before.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:43.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
But despite that... you became
friends with me all over again.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even though we had just met...

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
even though you thought
we were strangers,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
you still took care of me.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
At that point, I didn't
know what to think.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't know if I wanted
you to remember...

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
or if I wanted you to forget.

00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:38.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Kotomi] Those who seek out the</i>

 <i>They must not think</i>
 <i>only of themselves.</i>

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.705 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>from the beauty of this world.</i>

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:52.148 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'll never forget them.</i>

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:56.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
Daddy, why did you and
mommy name me Kotomi?

00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take a look around, Kotomi.

00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:01.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kid Kotomi] Hm?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Ichinose] Even though you
can't see them with your eyes,

00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:08.266 position:5% line:77% align:start
this world that we
live in is composed of
countless little harps.

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:11.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
Harps are also called
"koto", you know.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:14.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like the "koto" in my name?

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:16.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you know what is so
amazing about those harps?

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:20.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even though there are enough of
them to fill the entire world,

00:03:20.212 --> 00:03:22.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
each one has it's
own unique sound.

00:03:22.548 --> 00:03:25.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
And when all of those
different sounds come together,

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:27.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
it creates a single,
perfect melody.

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's why this world
is such a beautiful place.

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Ichinose] Your father
always gets carried away

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
once he starts talking
about things like that.

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:39.067 position:5% line:77% align:start
The truth is, the most
important things in life
are always very simple.

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:44.906 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kotomi is Kotomi, written in
three beautiful hiragana
characters.

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kiss sound] Mwah!
[Kotomi giggles]

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:49.310 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mrs. Ichinose] We love
you more than anything
else in the world.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're our little treasure.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:27.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was playing around here,
and just wandered in.

00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:29.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, what's your name?

00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:32.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi. Written in three
hiragana characters.

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
But, you can call
me Kotomi-chan.

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:50.977 position:5% line:77% align:start

00:04:51.077 --> 00:04:53.713 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>about you was different.</i>

00:04:57.718 --> 00:04:59.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Ichinose] A stuffed animal?
[Kid Kotomi] Mmhmm!

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:02.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want a big, fluffy
teddy bear for my birthday.

00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:04.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Ichinose] A teddy bear,
huh? Well, don't worry,

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:07.694 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll find you the biggest,
fluffiest teddy in the
whole world.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:11.431 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Kotomi] The truth is,</i>
 <i>I didn't care what I got</i>
 <i>for my birthday.</i>

00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:13.735 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:25.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? A business trip?

00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:27.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Ichinose] It came
up at the last-minute.

00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:28.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but
it's very important,

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:31.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I'm afraid Mommy and
Daddy both have to go.

00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.424 position:5% line:83% align:start

my birthday, remember?

00:05:38.327 --> 00:05:40.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya said he was
gonna come too.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But why
would you do that?

00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:41.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] I don't know.

00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:45.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are all articles
about the accident?

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:47.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the beginning, I thought
if I collected them all,

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:50.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
it would help me
atone for my sin.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the place of the
thesis I burnt,

00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:55.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
I cut out every newspaper
article about Mother and Father

00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:57.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
I could find,
and put them up here.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
But after a while, that didn't
feel like nearly enough anymore.

00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:03.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, whenever I saw Mother
and Father's name in a book,

00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:06.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
I cut it out, and I saved it,
just like the other articles.

00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:10.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since then, I've studied as hard
as I can, everyday without rest.

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:15.759 position:5% line:77% align:start
Because... if I did that,
I thought I could follow in
Mother and Father's footsteps.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't appreciate it at the
time, but Mother and Father

00:10:18.662 --> 00:10:23.001 position:5% line:77% align:start
always used the most beautiful
words to express how the
earth was formed.

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:27.639 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now that I've grown up, I think
that's something that everyone
in the world should know.

00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:33.812 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's a feeling that no
one else can create...
And that includes me.

00:10:33.913 --> 00:10:37.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
Still... I feel that if
I don't at least try...

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.389 position:5% line:77% align:start
that God will never forgive me
for burning my parent's thesis
all those years ago.

00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:46.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Kotomi...
[Kotomi] I never want to have

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:49.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] my heart broken
like that ever again.

00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:52.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't stand to lose
another loved one.

00:10:54.902 --> 00:10:57.105 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need to be alone right now.

00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:01.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
[3-A Teacher] I see,
so she told you everything.

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:04.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, ma'am. But have you
heard from Kotomi today?

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:07.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
She said she might not be
coming to class for a while.

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:11.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
[3-A Teacher] Let me ask you,
did you know that there's

00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
talk of Ichinose going
abroad to study?

00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:17.259 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Studying abroad?
[3-A teacher] She might
be entering a program

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:21.864 position:5% line:77% align:start
where students with good grades
can continue their studies
in American colleges.

00:11:21.964 --> 00:11:25.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
They may or may not decide
to come back to Japan.

00:11:25.335 --> 00:11:29.272 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ichinose didn't become
interested in the
program until recently.

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:31.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
But when I spoke to her
on the phone this morning,

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
she told me that she'd
like to go ahead with it.

00:11:37.014 --> 00:11:38.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you mean even though
you haven't seen each

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:41.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
other in years, Kotomi still
remembered who you were?

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:43.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. Although
I feel a bit guilty,

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:46.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
since my memory hasn't held
up quite as well as hers.

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:49.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I think I'm gonna try
visiting her house again.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go with you too.

00:11:51.363 --> 00:11:53.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should probably
go to class instead.

00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:57.169 position:5% line:77% align:start
After all, someone
needs to tell Kyou and
Fujibayashi what's going on.

00:11:57.903 --> 00:11:59.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I suppose so...

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.282 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:40.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!

00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:46.690 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]
Come on, didn't I tell
you to go to class?

00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:49.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
The third period was
changed to study hall.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say, I was
getting worried about you.

00:12:52.562 --> 00:12:54.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you taking care of her yard?

00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:57.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kinda. It's not too much, but I
wanna do whatever I can to help.

00:12:57.768 --> 00:13:01.506 position:5% line:77% align:start
When I talked to
Kyou and Ryou earlier,
they said the exact same thing.

00:13:01.606 --> 00:13:04.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
They wanna do whatever they
can to help cheer Kotomi up.

00:13:04.776 --> 00:13:06.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah? And what are
they planning to do?

00:13:06.943 --> 00:13:08.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry. It's a secret.

00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:09.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Give me a hint.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's someones birthday.

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I get it now.

00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:16.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess maybe the hint was
a little too obvious.

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:19.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi's birthday is this
upcoming Saturday, right?

00:13:19.358 --> 00:13:22.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right, but today's only Tuesday,
so we still have four days.

00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:27.634 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then pass this message onto
the others, "Let's all do
our best for Kotomi."

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:30.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:33.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
But still, even if they all
try their best, I think you're

00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:37.043 position:5% line:77% align:start
the only one in the world
who can get Kotomi to
come back to school.

00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:39.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's not exaggerate.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not exaggerating at all!

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:05.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] At this rate,
I'll never get done.

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:10.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like I might need
to buy some new tools too.

00:14:10.145 --> 00:14:12.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, there's always
tomorrow, right?

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Goodnight, Kotomi.</i>

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:24.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
You must be home, right?

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya gives a surprised
grunt as he trips]

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya chuckles]

00:15:03.637 --> 00:15:08.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I see. So this used
to be a flower bed, huh?

00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:10.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
It starting to look
a little better now,

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:13.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I need to pick up the
pace if I wanna finish this.

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:16.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gotta do something
about that thing too.

00:15:19.554 --> 00:15:23.191 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Looks like I'm gonna</i>
 <i>have to buy those gardening</i>
 <i>tools after all.</i>

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:31.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>This is a lot more work</i>
 <i>than I thought it would be.</i>

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:33.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki?
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:35.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey.

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:38.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
So what are you doing
loitering around here, Tomoya?

00:15:38.207 --> 00:15:39.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just a little shopping.

00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:42.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, aren't you Mister
Moneybags then?

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:44.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been saving up some money
from my part-time job,

00:15:44.347 --> 00:15:46.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I can get a place
of my own some day.

00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:48.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
So anyway, what are
you girls up to?

00:15:53.122 --> 00:15:54.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou and Nagisa
shout in surprise]

00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:56.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
You jerk!

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] This was Kotomi's
birthday present.

00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:02.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Or at least it was.

00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:05.604 position:5% line:77% align:start
We got in touch with the
student who donated the
violin to school.

00:16:05.704 --> 00:16:09.274 position:5% line:77% align:start
After we explained
the situation to her,
she said we could have it.

00:16:09.374 --> 00:16:11.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
We asked Nishina for advice
on how to fix it up,

00:16:11.878 --> 00:16:15.480 position:5% line:77% align:start
and she said we should take it
to a music store to have it
someone tune it for us.

00:16:15.581 --> 00:16:18.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were on our way there just
now when the accident happened.

00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:23.189 position:5% line:77% align:start
And just for the record, that
jerk on the motocycle is a
hundred percent at fault here.

00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:26.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you! If I'd had
a metal pipe right about now,

00:16:26.225 --> 00:16:29.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd give him and his bike a
beating they wouldn't forget!

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou growls]
[Nagisa] It was our fault too.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we were more careful,
this wouldn't have

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:34.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
happened in the first place.

00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:36.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the last time, I'm telling
you, it's not your fault.

00:16:36.938 --> 00:16:38.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
No more putting yourselves down.

00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:41.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
I agree. Anyway, staying
here won't do us any good.

00:16:41.575 --> 00:16:44.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's try going to
the music store.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Clerk] I hate to say it,
but with this much damage,

00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:49.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
it'd probably be cheaper
just to buy a new one.

00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:51.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now hold on a sec!
You're taking advantage

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
of our situation just
so you can make a sale!

00:16:53.956 --> 00:16:56.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's going too far, Kyou. He
was just being honest with us.

00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:59.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Sis, but I
think he's right.

00:16:59.127 --> 00:17:02.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, this violin is
really important to us.

00:17:02.197 --> 00:17:05.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know it's asking a lot,
but can you please help us?

00:17:05.668 --> 00:17:07.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Clerk] Mmm...

00:17:07.102 --> 00:17:08.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] We gave it our
best, but I guess it

00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:10.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
was really hopeless after all.

00:17:10.172 --> 00:17:11.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I'm telling you
guys, he was totally

00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:13.209 position:5% line:89% align:start
trying to take advantage of us.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I dunno. With
the shape that thing's in,

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:16.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
it probably would be
cheaper to buy a new one.

00:17:16.713 --> 00:17:20.417 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kotomi has to have this
violin for her birthday,
and that's final!

00:17:24.388 --> 00:17:26.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's try checking a different
music store, okay?

00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:30.761 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just 'cause one guy said he
can't do it doesn't mean we
should give up without a fight!

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:38.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Clerk] Well, yeah, I get
what you're saying, but...

00:17:38.135 --> 00:17:40.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
even if I could repair
your violin for you,

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:42.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's no way I could
finish the job by Saturday.

00:17:44.176 --> 00:17:46.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, how long
would it take to finish?

00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:49.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, at this point I'm afraid
it's kind of hard to say.

00:17:49.749 --> 00:17:52.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
It could be as little as one
month or as many as six.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:55.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way! How does two days sound?

00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:58.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know what, next time
we're gonna leave you outside.

00:17:58.257 --> 00:18:00.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, even if I
could repair it,

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:04.331 position:5% line:77% align:start
there's no guarantee that it'll
sound the same as it did
before it was broken.

00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:06.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Man, this is
really frustrating.

00:18:06.734 --> 00:18:09.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, yeah, what do you expect?
In the shape that thing was in,

00:18:09.403 --> 00:18:11.338 position:5% line:83% align:start
we were lucky the store
even accepted it.

00:18:11.438 --> 00:18:14.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm more worried about how much
the repairs are going to cost.

00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:16.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm sure we'll be able
to come up with something.

00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:19.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
If worse comes to worse,
we can hold a fundraiser.

00:18:19.247 --> 00:18:23.618 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, but your idea of
"fundraising" is more like
"blackmail", if you ask me.

00:18:23.718 --> 00:18:24.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou gasps, offended]

00:18:25.888 --> 00:18:28.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou sighs]
[Tomoya sighs]

00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:32.129 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just a few days ago we
were all having such
a good time together.

00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:35.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:42.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was wondering... do you guys
think Kotomi is still at home?

00:18:46.443 --> 00:18:49.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Wow! You really
made a lot of progress.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I can't believe you
did all that work by yourself!

00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:54.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm really impressed, Okazaki!

00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:56.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
What, are you kidding me?
As things are now,

00:18:56.154 --> 00:18:58.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't I'll finish
in time for Saturday.

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Kotomi! You're here,
aren't you?

00:19:03.996 --> 00:19:05.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come out and talk to us!

00:19:05.463 --> 00:19:07.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Kotomi!
[Ryou] Please, calm down.

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:10.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's probably better if
we don't try to force her.

00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:13.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's right. And you're
disturbing the neighbors.

00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:24.118 position:5% line:77% align:start
Okazaki, if you don't mind,
we'd like to help out
with the yard too.

00:19:24.217 --> 00:19:26.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
I appreciate it, but
it's getting kinda late.

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:30.390 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you guys don't head home
soon, your parents are gonna
start worrying about you.

00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:37.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou sighs]

00:19:37.264 --> 00:19:39.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case,
guess I'm taking off.

00:19:42.369 --> 00:19:46.108 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know you want to help,
but please try not to
push yourself too hard.

00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:47.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:50.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
After I organize the tools,
I'll head home too.

00:19:51.313 --> 00:19:53.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
Goodnight, Okazaki.
See you later.

00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:55.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
Try to get some rest.

00:20:05.963 --> 00:20:09.432 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alrighty then, I guess I'll
put in a little more work.

00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:27.619 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] What am I forgetting?</i>
 <i>What secrets do I have buried</i>
 <i>in my childhood memories?</i>

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Is Kotomi sleeping right now?</i>

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>If she is... is she</i>
 <i>having a nightmare?</i>

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Everything that I'm</i>
 <i>doing right now...</i>

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.799 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>it may all be for nothing.</i>

00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:43.036 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>struggles have been in vain...</i>

00:20:43.136 --> 00:20:46.239 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:20:46.338 --> 00:20:48.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>If that turns out to be true...</i>

00:20:48.574 --> 00:20:50.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>will I be strong</i>
 <i>enough to go on?</i>

00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:53.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!

00:20:53.613 --> 00:20:54.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:03.356 position:5% line:77% align:start
We're back already.
Did you miss us?
[giggles]

00:21:03.457 --> 00:21:05.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa read you like a book.
Just like she said,

00:21:06.027 --> 00:21:07.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're still here working.

00:21:10.032 --> 00:21:11.066 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Please let us help.

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
I promise we won't
get in the way.

00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:13.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, Okazaki?

00:21:14.036 --> 00:21:16.572 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright then, how 'bout
thirty more minutes?

00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:18.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa & Ryou] Sure!
[Kyou chuckles]

00:21:21.577 --> 00:21:23.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] That's right.</i>

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:24.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>There's nothing</i>
 <i>to be afraid of.</i>

00:21:26.182 --> 00:21:27.984 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'm not alone anymore.</i>

00:21:43.734 --> 00:21:46.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?
[Tomoya] Is something wrong?

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:49.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I just saw the curtain
on the second floor move.

00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:00.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on. Just a
little bit longer.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girls] Right!

00:23:42.128 --> 00:23:45.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] The day before
yesterday, I saw a rabbit.

00:23:45.698 --> 00:23:47.600 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.704 position:5% line:89% align:start
And today, it was you.

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:53.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
The boy who wandered
into my yard.

00:23:53.273 --> 00:23:55.343 position:5% line:89% align:start
I could never forget him...

00:23:55.443 --> 00:23:57.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
even after all these years.

00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:00.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, I don't know if he
ever understood my feelings...

00:24:01.016 --> 00:24:03.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I always cared
for him very much.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:06.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
He was my first and only friend.

00:24:06.955 --> 00:24:09.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I've been
waiting or him.
