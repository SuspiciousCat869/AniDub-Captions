00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:06.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh hey, good morning.

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:13.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hope you're hungry.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, thanks.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you stayed
up all night working?

00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:21.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you kidding? I went home
right after you guys.

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:24.748 position:5% line:77% align:start
Um, if you don't mind,
we were thinking about
skipping school today

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we could help you
out with the yard work.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I appreciate
the thought and all,

00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:31.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it might look bad
for the school

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:34.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
if we have two class reps
skip out on the same day.

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:39.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi!

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Are you sleeping okay?

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:42.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you eating okay?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're all really looking forward
to your birthday this weekend,

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:48.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I hope you're feeling
better by then!

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:55.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I don't know, guys.
Do you think she's really okay?

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright, guess I'll
see you tomorrow.

00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:07.857 position:5% line:77% align:start
You have to promise me you
two won't push yourselves
too hard, okay?

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:09.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
Alright, I promise.

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:11.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have a safe trip home.

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.805 position:5% line:77% align:start
Do you really think we'll be
able to finish the yard work
by tomorrow?

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:24.711 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, no sweat. I'm planning
on working through the night
so I'll have plenty of time.

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:28.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] In that case-
[Tomoya] No way!

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:30.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I haven't even
said anything yet.

00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:33.021 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] But you were going
to say you'd stay and help
me, right?

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:35.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
No way. If you got sick
or something,

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:37.159 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet your dad
would totally flip out

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
and take out a
restraining order against me.

00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:42.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] But weren't you working
late last night too?

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want you
to get sick either.

00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:48.475 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'll be fine. It's
nothing compared to what the
basketball team put me through.

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:54.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll take your word for it,
but if you ever need any help,

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:57.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
you just let me know and I
promise I'll come running, okay?

00:04:04.963 --> 00:04:06.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Man, I'm really beat.

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I hope you're
all right.

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:19.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're all worried
about you, you know.

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:26.423 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] The universe is not just
that which we can see.

00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:30.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
When this world was developing
its ideal shape and form,

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:33.566 position:5% line:83% align:start
a microscopic dimension
was sealed away.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
A hidden world exists.

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.805 position:5% line:89% align:start
A hidden world, he says...

00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:39.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:55.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess I made it in time
after all.

00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:07.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I read this book now,
she wouldn't mind, would she?

00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:10.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
"The day before, a rabbit."

00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:12.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Yesterday, a deer."

00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:16.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
I get it. So, those lines she
said were from this book.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
[yawning]

00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:31.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Kotomi] The day before
yesterday, I saw a rabbit.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:36.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
And today, it was you.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh man, where am I?

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:54.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
[rustle]

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:13.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've never seen you here before.

00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:16.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing in my yard?

00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:18.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was playing around here
and just wandered in.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:20.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, what's your name?

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:24.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi, written in three
hiragana characters.

00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:26.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you can call
me Kotomi-chan.

00:06:26.243 --> 00:06:29.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Kotomi, who's your
cute little friend?

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That was how</i>
 <i>I first met Kotomi.</i>

00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:37.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Kotomi] Well,
shall we eat?

00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:39.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
My pleasure!

00:06:42.998 --> 00:06:45.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Kotomi] This one
is a California poppy.

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:47.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
And this one over here
is a pansy.

00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:49.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow...

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:54.814 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kotomi, it's such a nice day,
why don't the two of you
play outside instead?

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:00.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
But this is outside.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
[giggling]
No, sweetie,

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
outside is on the other side
of those hedges.

00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:08.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are all sorts of exciting
places to explore out there,

00:07:08.497 --> 00:07:11.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
and all sorts of new
things to see.

00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:12.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't wanna, it's scary.

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:17.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day before yesterday,
I saw a rabbit.

00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:19.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.613 position:5% line:89% align:start
And today, it's you.

00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:22.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Kotomi didn't like</i>
 <i>to go out much.</i>

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:24.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>The furthest she would go</i>
 <i>was her yard.</i>

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>As far as I knew, she never</i>
 <i>had any friends over either.</i>

00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:31.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, when you have your
big birthday party,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
is it okay if I invite some
of my friends over too?

00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:35.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
[hesitation]
Aw, come on.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:37.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet everyone would
love to come here

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:39.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
and make friends with you.

00:07:39.237 --> 00:07:40.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Tomoya] It'll be fun,
I promise.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
[hesitation]

00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:45.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
[boy a] Huh? A birthday party
for some girl I don't even know?

00:07:45.512 --> 00:07:49.349 position:5% line:77% align:start
[boy b] Yeah, I don't know if
I want to be seen going to
a girl's birthday party.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:58.896 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>After what I said,</i>
 <i>I was so ashamed to show up</i>
 <i>at her party alone.</i>

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:01.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I lost my nerve when I made</i>
 <i>it to her yard.</i>

[hurried footsteps]

 <i>the courage to go see her,</i>

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>it was already midnight.</i>

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:10.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>But that didn't matter to me.</i>

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I had to apologize to her</i>
 <i>no matter what.</i>

00:08:19.588 --> 00:08:20.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
[young Tomoya] Huh?

00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi-chan!

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Kotomi] I burned
it, Tomoya.

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
I burned Mommy
and Daddy's thesis...

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so bad!

00:09:19.665 --> 00:09:21.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
You didn't burn the thesis.

00:09:21.401 --> 00:09:23.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's all right,
you don't have to cry now.

00:09:23.972 --> 00:09:27.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
That folder was for you,
not for your parents' research.

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:41.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>After that,</i>
 <i>I never saw Kotomi again.</i>

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:43.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>No matter how many times</i>
 <i>I stopped by her house,</i>

00:09:44.097 --> 00:09:46.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>she never came to the</i>

 <i>the afternoons we spent</i>
 <i>playing in her backyard,</i>

00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:57.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>as time passed, they began to</i>
 <i>feel like nothing but a dream.</i>

00:09:57.748 --> 00:10:00.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>And like a dream,</i>
 <i>before I knew it,</i>

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:03.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I had forgotten that any</i>
 <i>of it had ever happened.</i>

00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:07.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
[young Kotomi] I've never
seen you here before.

00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:09.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing in my yard?

00:10:11.565 --> 00:10:14.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you finally awake?

00:10:14.803 --> 00:10:17.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know. It feels like
I might still be dreaming.

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
The boy who wandered
into my yard...

00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:25.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
I could never forget him,
even after all these years.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, I don't know if he
ever understood my feelings,

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:31.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I always cared
for him very much.

00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:33.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because even if he
forgot about me,

00:10:33.693 --> 00:10:36.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
he was my first and only friend.

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:38.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why...

00:10:40.903 --> 00:10:43.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've been waiting for him.

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:45.843 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:48.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day before yesterday,
I saw a rabbit.

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:51.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:53.553 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.222 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] My Tomoya.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffling]

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:01.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm here for you.

00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:03.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone can't wait
to see you again!

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] The sky...
it's so beautiful.

00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:29.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah...

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:36.674 position:5% line:89% align:start
There she is!

00:11:47.523 --> 00:11:49.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Kotomi.

00:11:49.358 --> 00:11:50.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
We all missed you!

00:11:50.893 --> 00:11:52.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, Kotomi.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Good morning, Kotomi.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:58.335 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nice to see everyone again.

00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:02.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Were you all
waiting for me?

00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:03.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all,
we've got to celebrate

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:07.281 position:5% line:89% align:start
your birthday, right?

00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:08.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] My birthday.

00:12:08.682 --> 00:12:10.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right.
[giggling]

00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:11.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
And as for your present,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
this will have to do for now.

00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:15.324 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Here.

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:17.327 position:5% line:89% align:start
Violin gift certificate?

00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:20.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's actually the violin from
before that you like so much.

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:23.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were hoping that we'd be
able to give it to you today,

00:12:23.468 --> 00:12:24.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it got kind of roughed up.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
We found a music shop
that said they can fix it,

00:12:27.307 --> 00:12:29.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it looks like the repairs
might take a while.

00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:32.746 position:5% line:77% align:start
As soon as it's ready,
you can trade your coupon
for the real thing,

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:34.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
so try to hold on until then.

00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:40.122 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks you guys.

00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:43.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
[teacher] Ichinose!

00:12:44.127 --> 00:12:45.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's good to see you.

00:12:45.563 --> 00:12:48.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you're feeling up
to coming back to school.

00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:51.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you and
good morning, ma'am.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:55.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, by the way,
your guardian called

00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:58.813 position:5% line:83% align:start
and said he's stopping
by today to pay you a visit.

00:12:58.913 --> 00:13:01.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think he has something
important to give to you.

00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:06.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, don't worry about it.

00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:08.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, he's really not as
bad as you make him out to be.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:11.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But, you already
know that, right?

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:18.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about we have him come
to the Drama Club room?

00:13:18.205 --> 00:13:21.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we do that, you won't be
so nervous around him, right?

00:13:21.643 --> 00:13:22.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't have to be scared.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll be with you.

00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:26.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can do it together,
right Kotomi?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:33.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:37.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello, Kotomi...

00:13:39.132 --> 00:13:42.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for coming. I'm sorry if
you had to go out of your way.

00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:46.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, think nothing of it,
I'm happy to be here.

00:13:51.047 --> 00:13:52.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Father's briefcase...

00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:53.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:13:57.756 --> 00:14:00.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] It arrived late last night
at the research laboratory.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
It belonged to Dr. Ichinose
without a doubt.

00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:05.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
I opened it myself
to confirm it.

00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:10.472 position:5% line:77% align:start
Once I saw what was inside,
I knew I had to bring it to
you as soon as possible.

00:14:12.107 --> 00:14:14.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you mean you
found the thesis?

00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:16.379 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] Open it and see.

00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:26.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's all right, we're here
for you, Kotomi.

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:27.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, he's right.

00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:29.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, you can do it!

00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:45.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:03.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, do you know what it says?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think I can read English?

00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:07.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me see...
It says something like

00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:09.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
"If you find this suitcase..."

00:15:09.514 --> 00:15:11.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] "...please take it
to our daughter."

00:15:11.917 --> 00:15:14.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
At the bottom,
it's signed K and M.

00:15:14.587 --> 00:15:20.796 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] In this case, K and M are
the initials of Kotaro Ichinose
and Mizue Ichinose.

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
In other words,
Kotomi's parents.

00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:25.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
They always signed their joint
research theses that way.

00:15:25.601 --> 00:15:27.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
And this looks just like
Father's handwriting.

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:30.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
It must've gotten lost at
sea after the plane crash.

00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:33.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows how long it
drifted out there?

00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:36.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] It may have taken years
for it to wash ashore.

00:15:36.715 --> 00:15:39.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eventually, I imagine someone
found it, read the letter,

00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:41.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
and passed it on to
someone else.

00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:44.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
It probably continued like
this for quite some time,

00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:47.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
passing from hand to hand,
from country to country...

00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:51.334 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] That suitcase has gone
on a long journey to arrive
here today.

00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:54.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even the bear looks like it's
been handled quite a bit.

00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:59.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows how many people have
taken care of it over the years?

00:15:59.144 --> 00:16:02.615 position:5% line:77% align:start
You probably still don't know
what was in that envelope
you burned, do you?

00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:05.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you would be relieved
to know the truth.

00:16:06.754 --> 00:16:09.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean, it wasn't Mother
and Father's thesis?

00:16:11.894 --> 00:16:16.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
The truth is, a secondary copy
of that thesis never existed.

00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:20.839 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] Your father was making
revisions to it up until the
very last minute.

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he didn't have time
to make a copy before the trip.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, what was inside
the envelope I burned?

00:16:26.446 --> 00:16:28.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
The truth is, it was a catalog
of stuffed animals

00:16:28.883 --> 00:16:32.821 position:5% line:77% align:start
so they could pick out the
perfect teddy bear for
your birthday.

00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:37.293 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] Until today, you probably
wouldn't have believed me even
if I had told you.

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this bear here, doesn't seem
so farfetched.

00:16:40.497 --> 00:16:42.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
I still remember what
he said to me:

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:46.839 position:5% line:77% align:start
"For the first time,
my little daughter told me what
she wanted for her birthday."

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] It was something so
simple, but when he said that,

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
his face lit up with joy.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
But wait, the bear and note
weren't the only things

00:16:53.848 --> 00:16:55.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the suitcase, right?

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:58.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
What about Mother
and Father's thesis?

00:16:59.087 --> 00:17:01.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have it right there.

00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:14.373 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] "To Kotomi...

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:17.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if your life is full
of tears and sorrow,

00:17:17.377 --> 00:17:20.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
this world is still
a beautiful place."

00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:22.685 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is Father's handwriting...

00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
And this is Mom's...

00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:33.699 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] Although this suitcase
may have held their thesis
at some point,

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:37.470 position:5% line:77% align:start
somewhere along the way,
your mother and father
decided to replace it

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
with something they thought
was more important.

00:17:40.774 --> 00:17:43.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your parents were striving
to find the purest,

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:46.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
most beautiful way to describe
how this world was formed.

00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:50.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
I like to believe that what you
see before you is their answer.

00:17:50.721 --> 00:17:51.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] And to be honest,

00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:55.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
never before have I seen words
as beautiful and eloquent

00:17:55.293 --> 00:17:57.161 position:5% line:89% align:start
as those written in that letter.

00:17:57.261 --> 00:17:58.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
Until the very end,

00:17:58.564 --> 00:18:00.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
your parents thought only
of your happiness,

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:04.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
and cherished nothing greater
than your love.

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] <i>Mother, Father...</i>

Once everyone else shows up,
we can open presents and stuff

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:44.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Sounds good. I made
some dessert  for us, too.

00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:47.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
And knowing you, you probably
made too much again.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:49.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Yeah, but it's a party,

00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:51.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you're supposed
to have too much.

00:21:51.428 --> 00:21:52.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, I invited
a lot of people.

00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:55.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
It'll be a big deal
just like the concert.

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:58.672 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ah, hey! Don't you think
you might be over doing
it a little bit?

00:21:58.772 --> 00:22:00.908 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, are you sure they're
going to all fit?

00:22:01.008 --> 00:22:02.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:22:03.378 --> 00:22:05.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it'll all be fine.

00:22:06.248 --> 00:22:07.350 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] After all,

00:22:07.449 --> 00:22:09.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have a big backyard.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
Basketball's lucky, huh?

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:49.847 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sounds like you're reading
Okazaki's fortune instead
of mine.

00:23:49.947 --> 00:23:52.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't this kind of pointless?

00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:55.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] All right,
I'll tell you the truth.

00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:57.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:57.191 --> 00:24:00.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
I was trying not to cry...

00:24:00.694 --> 00:24:02.297 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara...

00:24:05.633 --> 00:24:07.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
What a pain.
So, what's the plan now?

00:24:07.703 --> 00:24:11.342 position:5% line:77% align:start
Come on, don't tell me you're
going to give up without
a fight, Nagisa.
