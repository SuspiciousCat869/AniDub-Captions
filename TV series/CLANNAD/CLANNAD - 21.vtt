Yeah, it's fine. I don't
remember the whole story,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.574 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I've been piecing it

are still a lot of things

left to decide on. Like
costumes and music...

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:39.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
How are we going to put
the costumes together?

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:41.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, are any of you
good at sewing?

00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I might be able
to do it if I tried.

I've never even picked
up a needle before.

In that case...

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
No problem, leave it to me!

00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:56.194 position:5% line:83% align:start
See? Aren't you glad we
asked her after all?

00:03:56.294 --> 00:03:58.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess, but aren't
you busy, Mom?

00:03:58.564 --> 00:03:59.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll be fine!

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:02.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll just work on it a little
at a time in between chores.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I dunno... I still
feel bad for asking her.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
But we don't have a choice;

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:10.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
there isn't anyone else
who can do it.

00:04:10.112 --> 00:04:12.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just don't want
to trouble her...

all is well my friend!

A video of a play, huh?

00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I guess that would
be helpful, wouldn't it?

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:42.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah... it's good
reference since

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:45.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've never actually
seen a play before.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
WHAT!? You've never
seen a play before!?

00:04:48.898 --> 00:04:50.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
No. Not a single one.

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:52.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
In fact, I was sick the
day of my elementary

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:55.205 position:5% line:83% align:start

even get to see that.

Hey... you can't do research
crying like that.

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:16.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know, but I can't help it.
That was really touching...

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:21.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
I never realized how amazing
theater could be.

00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:24.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
But compared to something
wonderful like this...

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
what we're doing is
just child's play.

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:28.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if it is, who cares?

00:05:28.383 --> 00:05:30.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] As long as you
give it your best...

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you'll be able to touch
the hearts of the audience.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess you're right.

00:05:35.392 --> 00:05:37.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just have to give it my best.

We were watching that video
you got her, that's all.

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:52.280 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:55.486 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:06:11.774 --> 00:06:13.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hmmm... it may be
a play after all...

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:17.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe Nagisa actually did
see a play in the past,

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:21.453 position:5% line:77% align:start
she just forgot about it
and that's why she doesn't
remember the story.

00:06:21.553 --> 00:06:22.822 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nope, not a chance.

00:06:22.922 --> 00:06:25.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
If she saw a play like
that when she was younger,

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure I would've remembered.

00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:28.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if I don't remember,
then it didn't happen.

00:06:28.897 --> 00:06:32.601 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't say where she heard
the story, but I can say
it's not a play.

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:34.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:38.442 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:40.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you find it?

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:43.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
No... This is something else.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Hey!

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:54.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now did you find it!?

00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:56.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] It's Nagisa's old
training potty!

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you so obsessed
with that thing!?

00:06:57.968 --> 00:07:01.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, shut up! You were the one
looking for it, not me, dumbass!

00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:02.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Keep it down, you two!

00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] You're going to
bother the neighbors!

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
You got us in trouble;
you happy now?

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:10.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Why is it my fault?

00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:16.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I got a great
idea for the play

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
when I was watching that
video last night.

00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:20.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What is it?
[Nagisa] A song!

00:07:20.932 --> 00:07:23.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we add a powerful song at the
climax of the play,

00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:25.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it'll liven things up.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:27.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you good at singing?
I never knew.

00:07:27.608 --> 00:07:30.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, I've only sung
during music class...

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:32.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I really really think it
would make the play better

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:33.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
if we added a song!

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.352 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you think it's a bad idea?

00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:36.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not that it's a bad idea...

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just think you shouldn't
overexert yourself

00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:40.558 position:5% line:83% align:start
trying to make
everything perfect.

00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:42.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're doing enough already.

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:43.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
You really think so?

00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:46.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it's not commercial
theater or anything, right?

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just do what you want.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll work out fine.

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're the one making it...

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
so it's your play
and your stage.

00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:55.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
My play and my stage.

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:56.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:07:56.846 --> 00:07:58.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I wanna sing a
song on stage...

00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:00.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
then that's what I'm gonna do!

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:02.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
I say as long as you're
doing what you want,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
then you're doing
the right thing.

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Right!

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:07.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] This is a world that
has come to an end.

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:11.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
An empty and still world
where no one exists but I.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:13.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's a small table
and chair in this room

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:16.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
but outisde the window there is
nothing bu an empty plain,

00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:19.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
stretching into an
endless horizon.

00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:23.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmmm. It's interesting.
I like it.

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:26.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's why I've been
trying to remember the rest.

00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:28.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
We tried to do research
on the story as well...

00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:31.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
but we couldn't come up with the
name, no matter where we looked.

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:33.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
But as it's written,
it isn't finished yet, right?

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.098 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Right.
[Tomoya] Whaddya think?

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:37.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you come up with any songs
that would be

00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:39.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
good as background music?

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the verdict, Rie?

00:08:40.838 --> 00:08:42.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I'm starting
to get it now.

00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:46.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is put
yourself in the girl's shoes.

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:48.681 position:5% line:89% align:start
Put yourself in her shoes?

00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:51.585 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nishina] It's not like being
alone at home or school...

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're really completely
alone in the world.

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a very oppressive sadness,
don't you think?

00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:59.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes... it's very lonely and sad.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.068 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then I think music with a sort
of melancholy tone would work
well.

00:09:05.904 --> 00:09:07.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm? Oh wow!

00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:10.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Are all of these
CD's yours, Nishina?

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:13.681 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, Rie is a music
lover after all.

00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:15.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nishina] How about
we try this one?

00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:24.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Music Plays]

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:28.034 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a piece called
"Ma Mere L'Oye" by Ravel.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Ma Mere," what now?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.572 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Ma Mere L'Oye."
It's French for Mother Goose.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:36.912 position:5% line:77% align:start
Since Nagisa's play takes place
in a sort of fairy tale fantasy
setting

00:09:37.012 --> 00:09:38.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought this might
be a good match.

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:42.319 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nishina] Ravel composed a
number of fantasy-themed
pieces like this.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.958 position:5% line:77% align:start
This one in particular was
based on several nursery
rhymes and fairy tales.

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:53.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Music Continues]

00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:56.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful!

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's amazing how well
it fits the play!

00:09:58.407 --> 00:09:59.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
Great, I'm glad you
thought so too!

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:01.244 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Door opens]
Great, I'm glad you
thought so too!

00:10:01.344 --> 00:10:02.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Sure is lively in here.

00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:04.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sakagami.... nice to see you.

00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:07.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, why are you wearing
glasses? It's weird.

00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:09.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because my vision's bad;
why do you think?

00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:11.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then why haven't I seen
you wear them before?

00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:13.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo sighs] I tried to avoid
wearing them,

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:15.964 position:5% line:83% align:start
because I don't like the way
they look on me.

00:10:16.064 --> 00:10:19.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't like glasses,
then why don't you try contacts?

00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:20.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm scared of those.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:21.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou Sighs]

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:22.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can relate.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
They are scary, aren't they?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
Enough about the
glasses already.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
How's the club doing?

00:10:29.014 --> 00:10:32.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
As you can see, things are
moving along quite nicely.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:33.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
But we still have a lot to do.

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:35.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
The real work starts now.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
As they say,
the road goes on and on.

00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:40.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's both do our best.

00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:42.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Make it a promise.

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:44.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:47.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought so.
You're a good girl, aren't you?

00:10:47.873 --> 00:10:50.209 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad it was you.

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:57.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's pretty cool for
a junior, I guess.

00:10:59.622 --> 00:11:00.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now that we've picked
out a song,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to try acting
with the music, okay?

00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:05.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
Watch, and tell me
what you think!

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] At one time,</i>
 <i>this room was empty...</i>

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:16.810 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>But now, all of these people</i>
 <i>have gathered here and filled</i>

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:18.880 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:12:17.626 --> 00:12:18.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, we're off to school.

00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:20.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you guys later.

00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:22.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow's finally the
School Festival, isn't it?

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:25.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give it all you've got at
today's rehearsal, okay?

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:27.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah! All I've got an more!

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:30.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No reason to
get so stressed out.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
Today's just the
rehearsal, remember?

00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:35.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
The real show isn't
until tomorrow.

00:12:35.282 --> 00:12:37.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, you've been practicing
so much that I bet

00:12:37.585 --> 00:12:40.555 position:5% line:77% align:start
your body will just start
moving on its own when
you're on the stage.

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:42.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're probably right.

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:45.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
You sure are cute, you know...

00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:49.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry but can we
wait till later to talk?

00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:52.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa, hey.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:56.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
Man, she's really
in her own world.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Male Student] Watch it,
that row is getting crooked!

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:02.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Female Student] Bring some
sheets over here too!

00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:07.325 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is a lot more complicated
than I thought it would be.

00:13:07.425 --> 00:13:09.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.433 position:5% line:89% align:start
My arms are getting tired.

00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:15.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stay right there, okay Nagisa?

00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you move around too much,
we won't know your mark.

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just a little bit higher. Good.

00:13:19.607 --> 00:13:22.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
The lights should hit
the center of the stage.

00:13:22.812 --> 00:13:25.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, now try turning them on.

00:13:26.683 --> 00:13:29.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now I'm starting to get nervous.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.425 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now hold on a minute,
this is something my son
asked me to get for him.

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:35.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but I can't just
hand it over like that.

00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:38.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't find something like
this anywhere, you know.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
It gets pretty dark back
here, doesn't it?

00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:45.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'll have to remember to
bring a flashlight tomorrow.

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:47.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
My heart is going to
beat out of my chest.

00:13:47.544 --> 00:13:49.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
Relax, relax.

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:52.785 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just don't think of the audience
as people and you won't
be so nervous anymore.

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:54.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then what should I
think of them as?

00:13:54.887 --> 00:13:58.992 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, you know, if they're
not people, then they must be
invaders from outer space.

00:13:59.092 --> 00:14:00.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
What kinda messed
up logic is that?

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:03.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
At any rate, since the aliens
are here to invade the Earth,

00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:05.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
they don't have any interest
in what Nagisa is doing.

00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:07.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want them to be
totally uninterested!

00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:09.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want them to watch a little!

00:14:09.707 --> 00:14:12.978 position:5% line:77% align:start
Okay, in that case,
your acting will determine
the fate of the Earth

00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:14.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
at the hands of the invaders.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you perform well, then
they'll leave us in peace...

00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:20.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if you perfom poorly, the
human race will be wiped out!

00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:23.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, that's way
too much pressure!

00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:26.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, c'mon. She's seriously
stressed out here,

00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:29.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
so don't say anything that's
gonna make her feel worse!

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:31.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
But for some reason,
I'm starting to calm down.

00:14:31.736 --> 00:14:33.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
What, seriously?

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, next up
is the Drama Club.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is everyone ready?

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:41.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uhm, yeah! We're ready to go!

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:43.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
Great. Give it your best!

00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:47.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I'm starting to
get nervous again.

00:14:47.423 --> 00:14:49.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
You kidding? You said you were
calming down a second ago.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know, I know.

00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:53.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
But everyone worked so hard
to make this happen!

00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:56.937 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're going out of your
way to help me, so I don't
want to let you down.

00:14:57.036 --> 00:14:58.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're not just doing
this for you.

00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:00.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of us care about
the play, too.

00:15:00.407 --> 00:15:02.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're just trying to liven
up the festival, right?

00:15:03.044 --> 00:15:05.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
I... guess so...

00:15:05.214 --> 00:15:07.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone has a part in
the School Festival.

00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to feel the
pressure all by yourself.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I guess I never
thought of it that way.

00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:16.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
Drama Club, if you're ready,
go ahead and start.

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:17.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
O-okay!

00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:18.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can do this, guys!

00:15:18.998 --> 00:15:20.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, I saw this thing
on TV

00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:22.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
where everyone puts their
hands together

00:15:22.102 --> 00:15:22.971 position:5% line:89% align:start
and does a big cheer.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
You wanna try it?

00:15:24.072 --> 00:15:25.674 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah! I've seen that too.

00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:26.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
It looked like fun.

00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:28.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'd like to give it a try too.

00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:31.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, everyone, hands in.

00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:34.987 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hee hee. I used to do stuff
like this on the soccer team
all the time.

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:36.555 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Drama Club!

00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:38.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, go for it, Nagisa.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:40.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone, take your positions!

00:15:42.061 --> 00:15:42.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:44.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Youhei.

00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:46.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now I'm starting to
get nervous too.

00:15:46.268 --> 00:15:49.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much everyone.
I'll do my best.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.107 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm home.

00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
How's it going?

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:18.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
Welcome back.

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:19.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, good to see you;

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're the fruit of our love
after all.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:23.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, I'm not
talking about you.

00:16:24.052 --> 00:16:25.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I kinda figured.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
So Nagisa, how did
the dress rehearsal go?

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:30.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, what did you think?

00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:33.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
Heh. Just like every
other practice...

00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:34.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
it went without a hitch.

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:36.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad everything worked out!

00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:37.903 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd expect no less
of our daughter.

00:16:38.004 --> 00:16:40.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
By tomorrow, every talent agency
in Japan will be calling her.

00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:42.475 position:5% line:89% align:start
I dunno; I wouldn't go that far.

00:16:42.576 --> 00:16:45.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, kid just smile and
agree with me, damn it!

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dad, Okazaki doesn't like
to flatter people.

00:16:47.682 --> 00:16:50.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I know. That's why you
can count on him, right?

00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:53.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, you'll give your mother
an autograph, won't you?

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
Talk about doting parents...

00:16:55.593 --> 00:16:57.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just wait, one day when
you have a daughter,

00:16:57.596 --> 00:16:59.031 position:5% line:89% align:start
you'll be the same way we are.

00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:00.566 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah right, are you kidding me?

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:02.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh I dunno.
I think he's right, Okazaki.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
You guys are a lot alike.

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:07.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way? Me and him?!

00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:08.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
My own daughter...

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:09.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes sir?

00:17:09.277 --> 00:17:10.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a shock; what a betrayal!

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, you're like,
two inches from my face.

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:17.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Knocking]

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:19.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come in.

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:21.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you about to go to sleep,
Okazaki?

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:24.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, not yet at least.

00:17:24.164 --> 00:17:25.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, do you mind if I come in?

00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:28.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
No.

00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:32.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Can I sit next to you?

00:17:32.642 --> 00:17:33.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:17:33.978 --> 00:17:35.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is something bothering you?

00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:39.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
No. Or, well, nothing in
particular, at least.

00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you too
nervous to sleep?

00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:48.730 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Is it that obvious?

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.301 position:5% line:77% align:start
With you, I'd be a lot
more surprised if you
COULD sleep, actually.

00:17:52.401 --> 00:17:53.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm a nervous wreck.

00:17:53.704 --> 00:17:55.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm trying not to worry,
but I can't help it.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's your first performance,
I don't blame you.

00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:03.883 position:5% line:77% align:start
But if you get all
the nervous out tonight,
you'll be fine tomorrow.

00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:07.388 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's a good idea.
I'll try to be as nervous
as I can right now.

00:18:07.488 --> 00:18:11.861 position:5% line:77% align:start
By the way, your mom and dad are
coming to watch the play
tomorrow too, aren't they?

00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:13.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:18:13.229 --> 00:18:14.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Is something wrong?

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:17.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
No... actually I'm more
grateful than anything.

00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:22.341 position:5% line:77% align:start
I realized today just how much
my mom and dad really care
for me, that's all.

00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:23.642 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know what you mean.

00:18:23.744 --> 00:18:25.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's hard to find
parents like them.

00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:27.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it makes me feel
kind of guilty, too.

00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:31.988 position:5% line:83% align:start
I still wish I knew what
happened when I was young...

00:18:32.088 --> 00:18:34.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, that. You mean how you
think you did something bad

00:18:34.691 --> 00:18:36.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
to your parents when
you were a kid?

00:18:36.994 --> 00:18:38.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:41.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cause knowing her,
she'll think it was her fault.

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:45.739 position:5% line:77% align:start
She'll think she's the
reason why Sanae and I had
to give up on our dreams.

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:48.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki? Did I say
something weird?

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:49.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no...

00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:52.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Listen, Nagisa...
[Nagisa] Yes?

00:18:52.114 --> 00:18:55.051 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sometimes you can be way
too sensitive about
that kinda stuff.

00:18:55.152 --> 00:18:57.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have this bad habit of
blaming everything on yourself.

00:18:58.022 --> 00:19:02.928 position:5% line:77% align:start
So don't get caught up on
this-you're probably just
imagining things.

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:05.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now, the only thing you
need to focus on is the play.

00:19:05.966 --> 00:19:08.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can worry about the
other stuff later.

00:19:09.037 --> 00:19:11.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess... you're right.

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:14.043 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll take your advice.
I'm sure it's nothing.

00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:14.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
Goodnight, Okazaki.

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:17.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, um...

00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:24.623 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thank you for listening to me.
I should be able to sleep now,
I think.

00:19:24.723 --> 00:19:27.794 position:5% line:77% align:start
Check to make sure you
have everything you
need for the play.

00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:29.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:36.406 --> 00:19:39.343 position:5% line:89% align:start
My costume, my towel...

00:19:39.443 --> 00:19:43.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! That's right. I need a
flashlight for backstage.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.551 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa?

00:20:42.694 --> 00:20:45.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Okazaki, it's you...

00:20:54.143 --> 00:20:55.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
Those pictures...

00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:58.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
I found a bunch of old photo
albums and diaries.

00:20:58.949 --> 00:21:02.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it.
I had no idea at all, Okazaki.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dad used to be an actor
when he was younger.

00:21:07.026 --> 00:21:09.662 position:5% line:83% align:start
He gave it up because
of me, didn't he?

00:21:09.762 --> 00:21:12.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
They both gave up their
dreams for me...

00:21:18.808 --> 00:21:20.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, forget about this,
all right?

00:21:20.744 --> 00:21:23.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just try to get some
rest for now.

00:21:23.514 --> 00:21:28.554 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll clean things up here...
you just try to get as much
sleep as you can, okay?

00:21:39.168 --> 00:21:41.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>After picking Nagisa up</i>
 <i>from kindergarten,</i>

00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:44.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>we took a walk down</i>
 <i>to the river together.</i>

00:21:44.943 --> 00:21:47.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'm so happy I get to spend</i>
 <i>time with her every day.</i>

00:21:47.947 --> 00:21:50.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Although I miss</i>
 <i>teaching sometimes,</i>

00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:55.089 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>if I hadn't quit, I never</i>
 <i>would've experienced</i>
 <i>so much happiness.</i>

00:21:59.496 --> 00:22:01.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
I messed up, huh?

00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:04.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the worst time for
this to have happened.

00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:07.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn it all...

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:47.071 position:5% line:77% align:start
I couldn't help but notice how
happy my parents looked in all
those photos.

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:50.910 position:5% line:77% align:start
But of course they were happy;
They were living out
their dreams.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.414 position:5% line:77% align:start
Not only that, it was
a happiness that could've
lasted forever.

00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:56.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not true!

00:23:56.384 --> 00:23:58.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, don't you think
they're still happy now?

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
But they still had to give
up on their dreams.

00:24:00.822 --> 00:24:03.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Am I wrong?

00:24:03.793 --> 00:24:07.299 position:5% line:77% align:start
And look at me... all
this time I've been trying
to live out my dream

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:11.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
without even thinking that
they had to sacrifice theirs.
