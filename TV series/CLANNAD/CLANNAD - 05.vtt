00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] So you want to go to
Miss Ibuki's house. Now?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, I think we
should verify this in person.

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.505 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then we can find out if
she's really Miss Ibuki's
sister, right?

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:17.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're coming with us, aren't
you, Fuko-chan?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I think I'll just wait here.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why wait here? If we meet her,
we can settle this quickly.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It does seem a little
suspicious after all.

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:04.663 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why wouldn't she come with us?

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:07.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Surely she must have
had a good reason.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You don't believe
it, do you?

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
That she's an apparition
of the living

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:13.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
or having an out-of-body
experience?

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:16.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or that she's just a spirit
and her body's in the hospital?

00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:19.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter how you look at it,
she's a real human being.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thats...

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
There must be something
around here.

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:26.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like a reason she has to insist
she's Fuko Ibuki.

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:30.351 position:5% line:77% align:start
Or that there's kind of
situation causing her to
believe that she's Fuko Ibuki.

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
Some agenda we're unaware of.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] What sort of situation
could it be?

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] How would I know?

00:02:42.794 --> 00:02:44.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Miss Ibuki!

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why hello there, it's me,
Furukawa.

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well Nagisa, how strange
to see you here. Oh!

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! I remember. You came to buy
pastries once.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:56.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Okazaki, I didn't know that
you knew Miss Ibuki.

00:02:56.472 --> 00:03:00.776 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Once, when there was no
one in the shop, I gave her a
bag of Sanae's pastries.

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:03.811 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I take it that you're
Nagisa's boyfriend, then?

00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, he isn't!

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.583 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] No, honestly, I don't
mean that I don't like you,
Okazaki.

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:13.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's just that there must be
someone more suitable for you.

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:16.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there someone you're
seeing already?

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, no, there's no one
like that.

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:20.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
There isn't anyone?

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:23.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Looks like It's your
chance, Nagisa.

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:26.730 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Whimpering]

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
Forget about what I just
said and all that stuff!

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you think that Nagisa
is cute as a button?

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:33.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes Miss Ibuki,
congratulations...

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:38.373 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh yes, that's right,
that's the reason we came to
see you in the first place!

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:43.611 position:5% line:77% align:start
You see, Okazaki and I heard
that you're soon to be married
to a man named Yusuke.

00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:46.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, we wanted to
congratulate you.

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:50.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] But where... where did
you hear about my wedding?

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:52.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you both even know
my fiance's name?

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:58.489 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I don't believe I've...
I don't believe I've told anyone
but my dear sister Fuko-chan.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.060 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a minute, your sister
Fuko is the only one
you've told?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why yes, my poor sister
who is in a coma.

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I thought you knew about
that, Nagisa?

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
That my dear sister is in a
comatose state at the hospital?

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, Yes...

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:16.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if she's asleep, I talk to
her about all kinds of things.

00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.975 position:5% line:77% align:start
I told her about my upcoming
nuptuals, but I haven't told
anyone else.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:24.011 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Uh, um...
[Tomoya] Nagisa and I heard some
kind of rumor at school.

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:27.246 position:5% line:77% align:start
Someone must have seen you
with your boyfriend and
then built on the story,

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:30.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
and spread it around to the
students at lunch.

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:32.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so? Then, I understand.

00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:35.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
How is your sister doing,
by the way?

00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:39.090 position:5% line:77% align:start
Strange you should ask,
I just went to see her,
as a matter of fact.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
Today, her color looked
so much better.

00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:43.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I...

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:50.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know if I'll get
married or not.

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
With my sister in that
condition,

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:52.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know if I should marry

00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
and find happiness or not.
I can't decide.

00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:59.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know if it's the
right thing to do, or not.

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:08.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is happening here?
What's going on?

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:10.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I almost said to that
poor woman,

00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:13.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
"She's not in a coma; she's
alive and well at school."

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:17.921 position:5% line:77% align:start
You should have said it! I mean,
if they were to meet face-to-
face, all would be clear.

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.791 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I feel like it's not
something you should
say out loud

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
without regard for
someone's feelings.

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:25.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
And Fuko didn't want to either.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.897 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Furukawa, are you
trying to tell me that you
actually believe all of this?

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:33.201 position:5% line:77% align:start
That the girl we've been talking
to is a ghost or apparition or
something?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.437 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe the marriage that someone
was talking about wasn't even
her marriage at all,

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was someone else's and she
overheard it.

00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:44.043 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] It's very strange,
but I can't believe that
Fuko is lying.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know why, but...

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:49.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
In order to get lots of people
to celebrate the wedding,

00:05:49.313 --> 00:05:53.484 position:5% line:77% align:start
Fuko is making all of those
beautiful hand-carved
starfish sculptures.

00:05:53.584 --> 00:05:56.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
And then she's giving them all
away to her friends.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.388 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey, don't cry.

00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:00.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I won't cry.

00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:04.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
But instead of turning to tears,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm turning to empowerment to
help Fuko in her plight!

00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:12.233 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have to say that you really
get energized when it's for
someone else, you know that?

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:14.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like, what about the Drama
Club, for instance?

00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:15.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, that's important too,

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:19.939 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm terribly sorry, I just
can't ignore Fuko right now!

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.544 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know that... I know you've
done so much for me but it
can't be about me right now.

00:06:25.644 --> 00:06:26.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sigh]

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll help you.

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:32.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko is on my mind, too.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
And it's not like I have
anything else to do.

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:38.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki...

00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:45.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure it's okay
for me to impose on you?

00:06:45.928 --> 00:06:49.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't have you sleeping at
school anymore, now can we?

00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:54.801 position:5% line:77% align:start
Your parents know about Miss
Ibuki and her upcoming
nuptuals, don't they?

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:57.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, she comes often to buy
pastries when they're fresh.

00:06:57.837 --> 00:07:00.338 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, you should keep your last
name a secret.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
Think of a cover story.

00:07:02.007 --> 00:07:03.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
I understand!

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:07.111 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] In other words,
you want us to let her
stay here for a while?

00:07:07.212 --> 00:07:11.014 position:5% line:77% align:start
Akio and I don't mind
at all, but what about
your folks, darling?

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] They're terrible
parents. I mean, can you believe

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.185 position:5% line:83% align:start
they just up and left her
and went on a trip?

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:17.620 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:23.325 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, Fuko, what would your
family's last name be?

00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:27.394 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Fuko] It's Isogai!
[Tomoya] <i>Can't believe she</i>
 <i>picked such an unusual</i>
 <i>last name...</i>

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:29.997 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko Isogai?

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:33.633 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why that would be the
name of the family next
door, wouldn't it?

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
[quietly] I can't believe she
just saw the nameplate

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:42.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
next door and decided
that was her last name.

00:07:42.373 --> 00:07:44.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Is she a relative
of the neighbors?

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:46.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's just an unexpected
coincidence!

00:07:46.344 --> 00:07:50.280 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] Well, my! It is a
strange coincidence, isn't it?
[Akio] Mm-hmm.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.583 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Even if she had used</i>
 <i>her real name, Ibuki, we could</i>
 <i>have deceived them.</i>

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.486 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would be... I'll be indebted
to you forever.

00:07:58.586 --> 00:08:00.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, such a polite girl you are.

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:04.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
And it's so very nice to make
your acquaintance.

00:08:09.062 --> 00:08:12.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rumbling]

00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:14.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rugby team screaming]
[Misae] Hey, you guys!

00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:17.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am not gonna let you
get away with that again!

00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:19.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rugby team] We're sorry!

00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:23.140 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Misae] Those guys are such
perverts! They were peeking
in the girls' dorm again.

00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks to me like they just
want your attention, Misae.

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:29.646 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you would be a little more
strict with them, they'll stop
doing stupid things, I bet.

00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:31.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can only hope that's all
it'll take to do it.

00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:34.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hitting would probably have
no effect, you know.

00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:36.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
An arm bar would work against
them a whole lot better,

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:39.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
especially if it's
delivered by a woman.

00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:41.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm actually opposed to acts of
violence, though.

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, so you decided to come
after all?

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey there, Peeping Tom.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:46.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Misae] Hold him!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei screaming]
[Misae] Say "Uncle!"

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:57.001 position:5% line:77% align:start
My arm hurts... Now, I can't
take on the Student Council
like I've always wanted to do.

00:08:57.101 --> 00:09:00.405 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] If it's about the
Drama Club, activities have
been postponed.

00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:02.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have something else
we have to do.

00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:03.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something else?

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, taking care
of the ghost girl.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:07.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
Except, I don't believe that's
really the case.

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Huh? The ghost?
[Tomoya] Fuko bothers me,

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm actually pretty worried
about Furukawa too.

00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:15.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be watching over them for
the time being while I help.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:16.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, that's it. Tea?

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.552 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?!

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:32.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm coming in, alright?!

00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:37.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:39.903 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is this?!

00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:42.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's blood all
over this thing!

00:09:44.174 --> 00:09:47.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What are you doing
so early in the morning?

00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:48.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look, it's Okazaki.

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:51.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well indeed it is! Good morning.

00:09:51.347 --> 00:09:54.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
Could it be, you've all been
carving these from last night?

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:57.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, we're all helping
Fuko with her stars.

00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Customer] Excuse me!

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.988 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Mister, a customer.
[Akio] Get'em.

00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:02.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Get who?
[Akio] The customer.

00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:03.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can't take advantage of

00:10:03.756 --> 00:10:05.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
your daughter's friend
like that!

00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:06.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's right, Akio.

00:10:06.892 --> 00:10:09.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Yeah, Sanae,</i>
 <i>you tell him.</i>

00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:12.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can help us carve
while you watch the shop.

00:10:14.132 --> 00:10:17.401 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you love me that much, you'd
want me to stay here with you
and send him out!

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nobody said anything like that!

00:10:19.403 --> 00:10:20.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Okay, shall we work?!

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Yes!

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'll get ready
for school.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:33.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Lined up like this, the
floor looks like the night sky.

00:10:33.414 --> 00:10:35.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why do you think that?

00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:37.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, they're stars, aren't
they? Shining stars.

00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:39.619 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're starfish.

00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:42.122 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're what?

00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:44.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're starfish.

00:10:44.223 --> 00:10:45.190 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what are you telling me?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
That all of you have been

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:47.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
carving starfish all this time?!

00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:49.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why yes, of course I am.
Why would we be carving

00:10:49.694 --> 00:10:51.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
something as silly as
shining stars?

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:52.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:55.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why should you be
carving starfish?!

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lined up like this,
they're all just so cute...

00:10:59.369 --> 00:11:01.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
...these starfish.

00:11:01.837 --> 00:11:04.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wait a minute, did you
hear these were starfish?

00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:06.908 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I thought they were
starfish from the beginning.

00:11:07.008 --> 00:11:09.710 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] How could you know
that?! Do you think starfish
are cute too?!

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're really cute, because
Fuko carved them.

00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:16.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, whatever... already...

00:11:21.521 --> 00:11:23.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here you go...

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:25.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:30.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You've given out
most of them.

00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:33.763 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thanks to your family,
I'll be able to give
out a lot today.

00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:36.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
Rather than handing out all
these starfish to the students,

00:11:36.533 --> 00:11:38.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
wouldn't you rather go
see your sister?

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:44.239 position:5% line:77% align:start
I... I really would like to,
but I don't know if my
voice will reach her.

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:46.674 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:49.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't see her,
and honestly can't say

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:51.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
if my little voice is loud
enough to reach her.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:54.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think maybe that's why
I'm doing all of this.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:12:00.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Ah, Fuko, what does
your sister call you?

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Fu-chan...

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:03.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, can I call you that too?

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:05.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why, yes!

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:06.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then can I call you that too?

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:07.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would be terrible!

00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:08.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why so terrible?!

00:12:08.725 --> 00:12:10.094 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Just because!
[Tomoya] You-

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:13.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miyazawa, are you in there?

00:12:14.097 --> 00:12:17.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
Welcome to you.
Good to see you both.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] And who might you be?

00:12:20.502 --> 00:12:22.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please... please accept this!

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:26.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm giving you a starfish.

00:12:28.808 --> 00:12:32.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you. So, did you make this
all by yourself?

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:36.882 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, you don't say? You're doing
this so people will celebrate
your sister's marriage.

00:12:36.982 --> 00:12:40.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes. And we decided to support
her in getting people to come.

00:12:40.618 --> 00:12:43.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
I support you too.
I want you to do your best.

00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:46.224 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will! Thank you very much.

00:12:46.324 --> 00:12:49.960 position:5% line:77% align:start
Seems to me you have a very
high tolerance level for a
girl your age.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Isn't it great that she
accepted one, Fu-chan?

00:12:52.928 --> 00:12:55.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, it was all thanks
to you, Nagisa.

00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:57.500 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya ]Are you two
ignoring me?
[Fuko] Because you
are the enemy.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm not the enemy!
[Fuko] Then, a natural enemy.

00:12:59.334 --> 00:13:01.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's even worse!
[Fuko] Rather, I want to say

00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:02.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] the worst natural enemy.

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:06.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki, you
mustn't harass Fuko.

00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:09.409 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko coos]
[Tomoya] <i>She gets like that even</i>
 <i>when Furukawa hugs her.</i>

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Ah, Fu-chan?

00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:13.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
Calling her name won't work.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
When she gets like this,
it takes a while.

00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:17.449 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fujibayashi!

00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:18.682 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] What is it?

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:21.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you come over here?

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:22.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] When she comes
to herself, tell her,

00:13:22.953 --> 00:13:26.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
"I'm Okazaki. I've become
a girl." Got it?

00:13:26.856 --> 00:13:30.460 position:5% line:77% align:start
She's always in a daze and
I think that's dangerous,
so I want to caution her.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.594 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you help her out?

00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:33.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I don't mind at all.

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
So the when she asks,
"How?" just tell her,

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.231 position:5% line:89% align:start
"It comes off sometimes!"

00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
For any other questions, just
say, "For the time being."

00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:41.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:43.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, Fun Team!
Let's hide and watch.

00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:48.974 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Will this really
help Fu-chan?
[Tomoya] Shh.

00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:52.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, what were we talking
about just now?

00:13:52.944 --> 00:13:56.014 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where's Okazaki and Nagisa?

00:13:56.114 --> 00:13:59.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I'm Okazaki,
I've become a girl.

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:00.350 position:5% line:89% align:start
HUH?!

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said... I said I'm Okazaki,

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:04.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I've become a girl.

00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:06.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko freaks out]
[Fuko] I don't understand!

00:14:07.056 --> 00:14:09.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
How did you become a girl
all of a sudden?!

00:14:09.358 --> 00:14:11.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
This just isn't possible!
[Tomoya snickering]

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] It comes off sometimes.

00:14:12.994 --> 00:14:15.363 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] What?! That
is too shocking!
[Tomoya laughing]

00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:17.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki,are you telling
me that it actually

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.567 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] comes off sometimes?
[Nagisa] Hey...
[Tomoya laughing]

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:21.034 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya laughing]
[Ryou] For the time being.

00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:23.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] For the time being?!
Does it come off easily?

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:26.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't know there were people
like that in our highschool!

00:14:26.506 --> 00:14:30.676 position:5% line:77% align:start
It couldn't possibly try to up
and attach itself to me now,
could it?

00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:31.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
For the time being...

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
It could?! That's a great shock!

00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:35.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Oh, did it attach
itself again?!

00:14:35.846 --> 00:14:37.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's with you?
What are you talking about?

00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:41.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a bad dream after all.

00:14:41.418 --> 00:14:45.821 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's good. I was afraid that
I might just turn into Futaro
some day.

00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:48.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki, you should
stop already.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] [gasps] There
are two Okazakis!

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:52.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
We divide sometimes.

00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:54.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm totally shocked!

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:57.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, Tomoya!
I've been watching you!

00:14:57.164 --> 00:15:00.833 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you even try to use
my sister for any of your
silly pranks!

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
The same face!

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
There are three Okazakis!

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.807 position:5% line:83% align:start
How much of an idiot
are you, anyway?

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:16.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Here you go!

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.449 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] For us?
[Ryou] My, this is a
really big star.

00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:21.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe it's actually a starfish.

00:15:21.384 --> 00:15:24.786 position:5% line:77% align:start
You knew it was a starfish!
Now you are one of my
starfish friends!

00:15:24.886 --> 00:15:26.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
What, seriously?
This really is a starfish?

00:15:26.787 --> 00:15:30.324 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, Fuko put all of her
heart into carving these
wooden starfish.

00:15:30.424 --> 00:15:35.630 position:5% line:77% align:start
Really?  Well, actually I
was only joking about it
being a starfish.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to both please
hug the starfish.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like this?

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
You look very good! Beautiful!

00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:43.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
I question your sense.

00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:45.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the two of them are
very pretty,

00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:47.939 position:5% line:83% align:start
and together they're
even more beautiful.

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:50.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
On the outside, maybe, but
they're different inside.

00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:53.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
The elder is a gorilla and the
younger is a hamster- Gah!

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:59.115 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!?
[Kyou] You said something very
insulting just now, didn't you?!

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:02.884 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sis, you really mustn't throw
things you've received as
a present.

00:16:02.984 --> 00:16:06.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah! Fuko would be hurt if you
treated it like that!

00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:10.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
It just seemed to me like it

00:16:10.157 --> 00:16:13.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
would be an object with great
offensive power.

00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:15.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
A flying starfish...

00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:18.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's possible!

00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:19.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think it's possible?!

00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:22.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone seems to be accepting
them very graciously.

00:16:22.534 --> 00:16:27.138 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, but on one hand we are
picking the people who seem
nice to give them to.

00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:28.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Mitsui!

00:16:28.673 --> 00:16:33.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I'm Fuko Ibuki, we talked
at the school entrance ceremony.

00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:35.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, now that you mention it...

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
You got into an accident,
didn't you?

00:16:37.012 --> 00:16:38.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
Were you discharged
from the hospital?

00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:40.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, Uh...

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:41.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes, she was discharged

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
and is repeating her
sophomore year.

00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:46.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
And we have a little request.

00:16:46.254 --> 00:16:48.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I want you to
please accept this!

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:50.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:52.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a present, and if you can

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
attend my sister's wedding,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.397 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would be very appreciative.

00:16:58.497 --> 00:17:00.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mitsui] I'm sorry,
but I can't accept it.

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:04.636 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're in your first year,
so you may not know,
but seniors are very busy.

00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:07.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of us have to study for
difficult entrance exams.

00:17:07.904 --> 00:17:11.641 position:5% line:77% align:start
And I just can't participate
in anything that will
cause lost time.

00:17:11.742 --> 00:17:13.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:16.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, poor Fu-chan...

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:24.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon, will ya Cheer up already?

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:25.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm fine. Really.

00:17:25.952 --> 00:17:27.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm only saying it because
you don't look it.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:31.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] It can't be helped. I
only talked a little with Mitsui

00:17:31.324 --> 00:17:33.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
at the school entrance ceremony.

00:17:33.292 --> 00:17:35.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad she even
remembered my name.

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:39.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I've never attended
a class.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
I only pick up pieces of
forgotten wood in art class

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:46.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then I carve them in one
of the empty classrooms.

00:17:47.537 --> 00:17:52.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish I had a chance to attend
even one class. Just one class!

00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:54.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, then I'll phone Kyou

00:17:54.242 --> 00:17:55.944 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] and Sunohara!
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:04.318 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] It's not a school day,
but there seems to be a lot of
people around.

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:07.320 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] It's almost Founder's
Festival, so they must be
preparing for it.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks to them we can
get into the school.

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Oh, they're here.

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:14.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi there! Good morning
to all of you.

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, Furukawa, Fuko.

00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:18.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Good morning,
everybody.

00:18:18.496 --> 00:18:20.331 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sorry to call
all of you out.

00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:23.801 position:5% line:77% align:start
I came for Nagisa's sake.
And I'd do anything for
her, you know?

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
We thank so much you, Sunohara.

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:29.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] But Tomoya,
why do we have to do this?

00:18:29.238 --> 00:18:31.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
Believe me, we have our reasons.

00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:33.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll explain it to you
all someday.

00:18:33.742 --> 00:18:35.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Fuko, what's
the matter?

00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
I feel kind of nervous today.

00:18:39.012 --> 00:18:40.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Fu-chan, come on in.

00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:43.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our class is almost
about to start.

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come over here!

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:50.221 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hurry on over, will ya?

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm!

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] We have all the students.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
What about the teacher?

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] That was the problem.

00:19:00.364 --> 00:19:02.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't ask a real teacher,
after all.

00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:03.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Hmm, wait a minute,

00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:06.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
is one of us going to be
the teacher, then?

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:08.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're an idiot,
so you can't do it.

00:19:08.203 --> 00:19:10.272 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] That's very
rude of you.
[door opens]

00:19:10.372 --> 00:19:13.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] All right everyone,
You should all take your seats.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
Class is about to start.

00:19:14.743 --> 00:19:17.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sanae, how did you...

00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:19.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] I heard about
it from Nagisa.

00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:22.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] If you don't mind, why
don't you let me be the teacher.

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:27.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] [quietly] Hey, Tomoya,
who is she? Nagisa's sister?

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:28.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] [quielt] Yeah,
something like that.

00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:35.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Somebody expects
an old-time campus drama.

00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:39.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] All right, everyone,
please go to your seats.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Sanae acts awfully</i>
 <i>like a real teacher.</i>

00:19:45.468 --> 00:19:48.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is our first class, so
let's introduce ourselves.

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:51.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here! my name is
Youhei Sunohara.

00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:54.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara is written with a
"spring" and a "field".

00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:56.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] What a wonderful name!

00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:58.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Ma'am, Sunohara
is an idiot!

00:19:58.244 --> 00:19:59.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Don't say anything
unnecessary!

00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:01.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] She'll find
out soon enough.

00:20:01.314 --> 00:20:03.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's his energy!
It covers his idiocy.

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.383 position:5% line:89% align:start
AUGH!

00:20:06.117 --> 00:20:07.486 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Tomoya Okazaki.

00:20:07.586 --> 00:20:10.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
At school, I'm just another
lazy delinquent.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Doing things at
your own pace is best.

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:14.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm Nagisa Furukawa.

00:20:14.224 --> 00:20:17.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara and Okazaki aren't
being serious; they're goofing.

00:20:17.227 --> 00:20:20.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I would like to take this
class very seriously.

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:22.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
You sound like a class leader
or something, to me.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:24.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
N-No, I'm not!

00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:27.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, why don't you be
the class leader?

00:20:27.502 --> 00:20:31.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, I think...
I think it should be Fu-chan.

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:34.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, she IS the center
of this class.

00:20:34.574 --> 00:20:37.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're all here because
we care for her.

00:20:37.844 --> 00:20:39.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sounds good to me.

00:20:39.478 --> 00:20:41.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko, so, would you
like to do it?

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:46.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] No objections!

00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:49.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Do your best, okay,

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:51.588 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Class Leader?
[Youhei] Well, if Nagisa
says so...

00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:53.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Round of applause]

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well Class Leader, if you would,
please introduce yourself.

00:20:57.026 --> 00:20:57.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
I am Ibuki-

00:20:58.026 --> 00:20:59.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you're not!

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:02.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, my name is Fuko Isogai
and I like starfish!

00:21:02.898 --> 00:21:05.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for sharing,
you did well.

00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:08.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Fuko?

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:15.742 position:5% line:77% align:start
Fuko-chan, the people here
are all your classmates and
your friends.

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:17.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's all get along, okay?

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] You all can get along,
can't you?

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
[All] Yes ma'am!

00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:41.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Now let's
start our class.

00:21:41.596 --> 00:21:42.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
Class Leader?

00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:45.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Call to order,
call to order.

00:21:45.132 --> 00:21:47.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Huh? Oh! Stand up!

00:21:48.569 --> 00:21:50.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Bow!

00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:51.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Sit down!

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Fuko Ibuki...</i>

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:06.550 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>She's a little different, but</i>
 <i>she still seems like an</i>
 <i>ordinary girl.</i>

00:23:42.696 --> 00:23:44.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Miss Ibuki at
the Founder's Festival?

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.668 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes, I thought we
could invite Miss Ibuki and
have the two meet.

00:23:48.768 --> 00:23:51.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
So we can get to
the bottom of this.

00:23:51.436 --> 00:23:52.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I see...

00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:54.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
That may be a good idea.

00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:58.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Excuse me, little boy,
please accept this.

00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:01.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I want Fu-chan and
Miss Ibuki to meet after all.

00:24:03.312 --> 00:24:04.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] My sister and I
talked about attending

00:24:04.914 --> 00:24:07.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Founder's Festival
after she entered school.

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:10.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Isn't that nice,
Fu-chan?

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:11.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Yes!
