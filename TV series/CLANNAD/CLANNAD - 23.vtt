[cicadas buzzing]

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Nice weather, huh?

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Yeah!

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seems like a waste
to go to class.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't we skip and
go to the beach?

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give it up already, Okazaki.
You say that every day!

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.089 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course, cause these
supplementary classes
are a waste of time.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm not going to college,
then there's no point.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:25.865 position:5% line:77% align:start
It doesn't matter.
You made a commitment,
so you have to honor it.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, it still goes
on your school record.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sigh] You sure like to worry
about me, don't you?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, what do you expect?

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.110 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, because you're, um...

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're very special to me,
Okazaki.

00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:42.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] [gulps nervously]

00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:44.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Nagisa!

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:45.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh huh, yeah?!

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:47.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
You, um, wanna hold hands?

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:48.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Uh! Huh?

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:50.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just try it.

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:52.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I don't know.
I mean, we're in public.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
What if someone sees us?

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:56.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's nobody around.
Don't worry about it.

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:57.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
[motorcycle engine]

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, we're going out,
aren't we?

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong with holding hands
once in a while?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
[motorcycle engine]

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:05.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I guess you have a point.
No harm in trying.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:10.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
Good morning!
[motorcycle engine]

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
Coming through!

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:15.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lovey-dovey first thing
in the morning.

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.132 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait, don't tell me you were
about to kiss before I
interrupted?

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:20.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, don't be stupid!
Of course not!

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, what he said.
We haven't started kissing yet.

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:24.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were just trying to hold-
(umph!)

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:26.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, shut up!

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.713 position:5% line:89% align:start

[Tomoya]
 <i>The school festival is over,</i>
 <i>we're finished with exams,</i>

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:07.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>and summer vacation</i>
 <i>is finally here.</i>

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:11.548 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Still, not much has changed and</i>
 <i>I'm still freeloading at</i>
 <i>Nagisa's house.</i>

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:14.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thus, the price of rice rose
steadily, and in Toyama...

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:15.820 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Even though</i>
 <i>it's summer vacation,</i>
[teacher continues lecturing]

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>seniors like me still have</i>
 <i>supplementary classes.</i>

00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:21.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But I'm toughing it out for</i>
 <i>Nagisa's sake at least.</i>

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:24.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Are there any
questions before I move on?

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Every day, nothing but
study, study, study.

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:34.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so sick of all this.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the last summer vacation
of our lives

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:38.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
and we're stuck indoors
reading books all day.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
You might think it's boring,

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm actually happy to be
studying with everyone for once.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:48.362 position:5% line:77% align:start
And on the bright side,
we still get to eat lunch
together every day, right?

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:49.731 position:5% line:89% align:start
That reminds me...

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
What the heck are you doing
lurking around here?

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
As Student Council President,
I'm required to come to school.

00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:57.541 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know that! I'm asking
why you're hanging out
with us every day

00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
when you're not even
in the Drama Club!

00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:02.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where's Okazaki?
I haven't seen him.

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:03.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
(oh?)

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:04.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:07.854 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki said he was going
over to Sunohara's.

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:08.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] (uh...)

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.758 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, is something wrong?

00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:13.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just noticed that you
still call him Okazaki.

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, is something
wrong with that?

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:17.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't say it's "wrong",

00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
but since Tomoya calls you
Nagisa, it does seem a bit odd.

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.243 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you two are going out,
then shouldn't you be
on a first name basis?

00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:29.650 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, now that you mention it, I
seem to remember someone telling
me the same thing before.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, let's hear it. How far
have you two gone anyway?

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:34.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.827 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, actually...

00:04:37.928 --> 00:04:40.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] What? You haven't
even held hands yet?!

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you, in grade school?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.304 position:5% line:77% align:start
Next you're gonna tell me
you're afraid she's gonna
give you cooties!

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:46.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Shut up.

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:49.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
When the moment comes,
it can be really nerve-wracking.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:53.681 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ah, I can't believe Nagisa's
wasting her time who
won't even hold her hand.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:58.521 position:5% line:77% align:start
She should get with me, so I can
teach her the true meaning of
love. [knock on door]

00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:01.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, you have a visitor.
[Youhei] Huh? Me?

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:03.895 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, and she's really cute too.

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:05.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
She can't wait to see you.

00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:07.733 position:5% line:89% align:start
WHAT?! FOR REAL?!

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
YAHAA!!!

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:12.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you waitin', Baby!

00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:15.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
Youhei, hi!

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] (urk...)

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mei, it's you.

00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:23.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's been a while, huh, Okazaki?

00:05:23.254 --> 00:05:25.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nice to see you!

00:05:26.557 --> 00:05:29.228 position:5% line:83% align:start
I called and told you I was
coming over today, didn't I?

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.997 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why are you surprised?

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.900 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Sorry, I forgot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah, you're hopeless, Youhei.
Give me a break.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
When we're finished
cleaning up in here,

00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:40.441 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't we go say hi
to Nagisa's mom and dad?

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:42.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Okay!

00:05:45.582 --> 00:05:47.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
[ALL] Thanks for the food!

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
(giggle) You're always so polite
and well-mannered, Mei.

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:55.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure to have you.

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:58.233 position:5% line:77% align:start
When you put it that way,
it's hard to believe she's
Sunohara's sister.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't say
things like that.

00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:02.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think Sunohara is a
very nice person.

00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:06.143 position:5% line:77% align:start
Mei, if you're looking for a
place to stay, I hope you
know you're welcome here.

00:06:06.243 --> 00:06:07.844 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, really? You don't mind?

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:09.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course not!
It's our pleasure!

00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:11.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
[all laugh]

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:14.586 position:5% line:71% align:start
We should all take
a bath after this.
[Tomoya] <i>This family sure loves</i>
 <i>company, don't they?</i>

00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:16.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Oh, count me in too!

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:21.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Hmm...

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:23.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's a bit crowded in
here. I hope you don't mind.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seem to be enjoying themselves.
[Mei] No, of course not,

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:29.473 position:5% line:71% align:start
If I ask, do you think they'll
let me join in maybe?
[Mei] that just means I have an
excuse to snuggle up together.

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:42.256 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Oh, good morning, Okazaki!
Now everyone's up.

00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:44.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Morning, Okazaki. (yawns)

00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:46.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
Morning, you two!
Didn't get much sleep?

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:49.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not really, since we were up
all night talking in bed.

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:52.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were the big topic
of discussion, by the way.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] <i>Am I that interesting?</i>

00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:57.310 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, Nagisa, why don't you
go back to sleep for
a little while?

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nah, I'll be fine
once I get going.

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:03.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, my classes are over,
so I'm off from school.

00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:05.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, you're on vacation and
you spend it working?

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:07.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to
put it that way.

00:07:07.857 --> 00:07:10.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to let Mom and Dad
take some time off for a change.

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:14.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think of it as work.
I'm happy to help!

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:17.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know this probably isn't your
idea of a vacation,

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:20.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
but maybe we can do something
tomorrow instead.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:21.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
(ungh)

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just think of this as
a way to pay your rent.

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

00:07:26.248 --> 00:07:30.186 position:5% line:77% align:start
My lovely daughter was kind
enough to give me this time off,
so...

00:07:30.286 --> 00:07:32.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'M GONNA PLAY!!

00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:34.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
So long. (maniacal laughter)

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:38.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
Isn't it wonderful that he's
still a child at heart
after all these years?

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:40.766 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:43.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was busy baking these.

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:46.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, that must be your
special recipe, huh?

00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:49.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes! If you'd like to try some,
help yourself.

00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:51.948 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Yay!

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:56.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah... (grinding chomp)

00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:57.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
How do you like it?

00:07:57.888 --> 00:07:59.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] It's cute!
I realy like the rainbow colors.

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:01.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm happy to hear it.

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.164 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya]
"Cute," she says. Very clever.
[Sanae] Still, I wonder if we'll
sell out today?

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:07.202 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]
I'll have to use that next time.
[Mei] Oh, I'm sure we will.

00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:08.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry to leave so soon,

00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:10.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I have a neighborhood
board meeting to attend.

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:12.908 position:5% line:83% align:start
The shop's in your hands,
so good luck.

00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:15.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
See you later, Mom.
(Mei giggles)

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
[LOUDSPEAKER] Please listen to
the following announcement.

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:23.323 position:5% line:77% align:start
Today, we are collecting
electroinc recyclables from all
houses in this neighborhood.

00:08:23.423 --> 00:08:25.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you have any such items that
you are not using,

00:08:25.892 --> 00:08:28.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
such as television sets,
refrigerators, computers...

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure is slow.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:33.802 position:5% line:77% align:start
You guys had a lot more
customers the last time
I came to visit.

00:08:33.903 --> 00:08:36.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
A lot of students come here for
lunch during the school year,

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:38.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
but things slow down
on summer break.

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
(door opens)

00:08:40.278 --> 00:08:41.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, hello...

00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi, welcome to the store.
Here, take one!

00:08:43.748 --> 00:08:44.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Damn, she's fast.</i>

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN]
Thank you. Oh, look at that.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:49.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
Such cute girls are
watching the shop today.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.194 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] I know!
Nagisa's adorable, isn't she?

00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:54.531 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, I think she's
talking about you.

00:08:54.631 --> 00:08:57.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no.
I think both of you are cute.

00:08:57.267 --> 00:09:00.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
(giggle) Thank you!
That's nice of you to say.

00:09:00.971 --> 00:09:04.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you, please come again!

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
You weren't helpful at all,
Okazaki.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
You need to step up
your game plan.

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
It would have been overkill
with all three of us.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
Any way you look at it,
I'm the third wheel.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:14.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's not true at all!
Don't say that!

00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:16.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if you're not much help,

00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:19.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm still happy to be
working with you.

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:20.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Don't worry, Okazaki.

00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:22.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just take care
of the register

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:25.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
while I go outside and
find some new customers.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
Find customers?!

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:27.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, Mei!

00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:29.909 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei & Tomoya]
Welcome to the store!

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:34.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh my, that's odd. Akio and
Sanae aren't here today?

00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:36.985 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, we're watching over
the shop for today.
(door opens)

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:39.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec, this place
is a bake shop?

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:40.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right, come on in!

00:09:40.823 --> 00:09:43.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see. That's not quite what
I expected, I guess.

00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:46.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
I knew it was some kind of shop,
but I wasn't thinking "bakery."

00:09:46.565 --> 00:09:49.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their bread is really good.
You should try some.

00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:53.574 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, since I'm here, I guess
I might as well buy something.

00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:55.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
(door opening)
Welcome to the store!

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec, this place
is a bake shop?

00:09:58.447 --> 00:09:59.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
See, didn't I tell you?

00:09:59.848 --> 00:10:01.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
But hey, look, the girl
inside really is cute.

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:04.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
(ah) Wait, what's going on here?

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:07.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
(door opening)
(grrr...)

00:10:07.392 --> 00:10:09.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
Watch the register!

00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:10.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
There she is! Mei!

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.131 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:14.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
(panting) Hey! What the heck
are you telling these people?!

00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:16.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
"A cute girl works here!"

00:10:16.604 --> 00:10:19.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but people aren't coming
there for the bread!

00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:23.045 position:5% line:77% align:start
But as long as they come,
it doesn't matter, right?
(snickers)

00:10:23.146 --> 00:10:24.014 position:5% line:89% align:start
(ugh...)

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:25.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]
Okazaki! It's getting busy.

00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:27.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you come and help me?

00:10:27.485 --> 00:10:29.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
B-be right there!

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:35.061 position:5% line:77% align:start
There's a cute girl in there.
Don't you want to
go check it out?

00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
[boys grumbling and arguing]

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.679 position:5% line:77% align:start
[AKIO]
Holy crap, we haven't sold this
much since our grand opening.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:48.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that was years ago!

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then try working for a change.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:54.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Some of the customers even
came back two or three times.

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:56.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
In case you were wondering,
Sanae's bread sold out too.

00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:58.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the biggest
surprise of all.

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:02.531 position:5% line:77% align:start
Akio dear, when you put it like
that, you make it sound like my
bread never sells.

00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:04.132 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sanae, I love you!

00:11:04.232 --> 00:11:06.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although I don't know what that
has to do with selling bread,

00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:08.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love you too, Akio!

00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:11.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
Isn't there something you
wanna say, Okazaki?

00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:12.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like what?

00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:14.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Nagisa, I love you!"

00:11:15.014 --> 00:11:16.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] (urk!)
[Nagisa] Huh?!

00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:18.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I can't say that out loud!
Geez!

00:11:18.318 --> 00:11:21.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I'm gonna start cooking
dinner, okay?

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:23.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna sweep the front
of the store.

00:11:24.993 --> 00:11:26.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
(disappointed sigh)

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:34.139 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Go figure.
Today's she's having fun
with Nagisa again.

00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:36.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
(gulping)

00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:41.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's that girl thinking,
ignoring her brother like this?

00:11:41.415 --> 00:11:43.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
Quit sulking.
It's getting on my nerves.

00:11:43.884 --> 00:11:45.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she'll stop by
eventually.

00:11:45.887 --> 00:11:47.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei]
I wonder about that...

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:48.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
[single knock on door]
[Mei] Hello!

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:50.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
See that? There she is now.

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:54.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, if she insists,
I guess I'll humor her.

00:11:54.332 --> 00:11:57.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure is predictable, isn't he?

00:11:57.202 --> 00:11:59.572 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had a feeling I could
find you here.

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:00.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
You came to see me?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.342 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Uh huh!

00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:05.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
Youhei, I need to talk to
Okazaki in private for a sec.

00:12:05.414 --> 00:12:08.183 position:5% line:77% align:start
You think you could
wait outside?
[Youhei] (urk...)

00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:14.726 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] Come on, hurry up!
You're in the way!
[SUNOHARA] (struggling)

00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:16.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
(wailing and sobbing)

00:12:16.896 --> 00:12:19.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's he crying about?

00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:20.966 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, whatever.

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know this is kind of sudden,

00:12:22.803 --> 00:12:25.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I think it's time for me
to step in and play Cupid.

00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:26.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] Play Cupid?

00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:28.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:12:28.242 --> 00:12:30.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see, so you were worried
after all, huh?

00:12:30.747 --> 00:12:31.781 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad to hear it.

00:12:31.881 --> 00:12:33.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei]
Yeah, of course I'm worried.

00:12:33.383 --> 00:12:35.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
But there's no one really
special at the moment.

00:12:35.753 --> 00:12:39.424 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei]
What are you talking about?
She's right in front of you.

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:40.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
WHAT?!

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Sunohara and Mei?!</i>

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.964 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>But that's incest!</i>

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:47.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Hey, Youhei...

00:12:47.869 --> 00:12:49.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what is it, Mei?

00:12:49.872 --> 00:12:51.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ever since you moved away,

00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:54.878 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've had these thoughts about
you that I can't get
out of my head.

00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:56.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What kind of thoughts?

00:12:56.948 --> 00:12:58.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thoughts I've never had before.

00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:01.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ones that didn't cross my mind
when we were together.

00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:04.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean you have a little more
respect for me now.

00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:07.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, it's not that.

00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:09.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's something...

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
more naughty.

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mei?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
You naughty girl.

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:17.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Youhei, hold me.

00:13:17.106 --> 00:13:18.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sound effect] Ooohhh...

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:21.713 position:5% line:83% align:start
Man, that's getting me
worked up! (cat meows)

00:13:21.814 --> 00:13:24.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
Will you get your mind out of
the gutter for a second?

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:25.886 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, it's you and Sunohara.

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:27.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you expect?

00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:29.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please don't involve me in your
perverse incest fantasies.

00:13:29.824 --> 00:13:33.328 position:5% line:77% align:start
Besides, I said I'm playing
Cupid, not that I'm in love
with someone!

00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:35.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on a second! You mean
you're talking about me?!

00:13:36.064 --> 00:13:38.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Yes!

00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:40.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, Sunohara...

00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:42.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it, Okazaki?

00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:46.846 position:5% line:77% align:start
Latley, I've had these thoughts
about you that I just can't
get out of my head.

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:48.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What kind of thoughts?

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:50.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thoughts I've never had before.

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:53.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ones that I don't think
about other guys.

00:13:53.588 --> 00:13:56.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying you're proud to
call me your friend now?

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's something a
little different.

00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:00.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean...

00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:02.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wanna run to school
with you...

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
wearing matching boxer shorts
and not much else.

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:07.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:09.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hurry up and catch me!
I'm right here!

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:11.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Stop teasing me!
It's not fair!

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:14.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] (laughs)
Come and get me!

00:14:14.248 --> 00:14:16.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Here I come!

00:14:16.284 --> 00:14:18.186 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sound effect] Aaahhh...

00:14:18.286 --> 00:14:21.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh man, what's wrong with me?
[cat meows]

00:14:21.357 --> 00:14:23.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, can I continue now or what?

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:26.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I think Akio's been
rubbing off on me lately.

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:28.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
What I've been trying to say

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
is that I'm worried about
you and Nagisa.

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:33.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.376 position:5% line:77% align:start
To be blunt, I don't think
you two have been open
with each other.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:37.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
You guys have been serious about
each other for weeks,

00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:39.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you're still acting
like this?

00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:43.654 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't believe I'm being
lectured about romance by a
middle schooler.

00:14:43.754 --> 00:14:45.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here's a question for you.

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:48.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you could change one thing
about Nagisa, what would it be?

00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:50.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What would I change?

00:14:50.228 --> 00:14:51.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me see...

00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:53.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, she tends to be critical
of herself a lot,

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:57.372 position:5% line:77% align:start
so I guess, if it was my choice,
I'd like her to have more
confidence.

00:14:57.472 --> 00:14:59.374 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's exactly what I was
thinking too!

00:14:59.474 --> 00:15:02.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is great!
My plan my work after all!

00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
Plan? What plan?
[knock on door]

00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:07.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, Okazaki...

00:15:07.351 --> 00:15:10.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, speaking of the devil,
there she is now!

00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:11.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a coincidence!

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Coincidence, huh?

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:17.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Well, looks like I'm in
the way. I guess I'll be going.

00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:22.203 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a sec, I thought you two
were supposed to be
hanging out today.

00:15:22.303 --> 00:15:24.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, uh...

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.112 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, yeah, I guess
I forgot about that.
[Tomoya] (sighs)

00:15:28.211 --> 00:15:31.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, hey, Tomoya...

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! I'm Tomoya now?

00:15:33.118 --> 00:15:35.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]
Tomoya, are you busy right now?

00:15:35.922 --> 00:15:38.025 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm totally free.

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:39.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's good.

00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:42.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, whaddya say the two of us
go for a little walk?

00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:44.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:48.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
I... I just thought it'd be nice
to take a walk. That's all.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not a problem, is it?

00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:52.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
No problem at all.

00:15:52.143 --> 00:15:53.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know...

00:15:53.478 --> 00:15:56.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're... really lucky, Tomoya!

00:15:56.983 --> 00:15:58.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why's that?

00:15:58.118 --> 00:15:59.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
B-because you get to
go on a walk

00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:01.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
with a sort of cute
girl like me.

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:03.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] (whhhaaa?!)

00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:08.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
I... I, um, I said cute,
but just sort of cute.

00:16:08.263 --> 00:16:10.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sure, whatever.
But where are we going?

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right. I guess we...

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
should go back home.
[Tomoya] (waaahhh!)

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
Already?! But we just left!

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:20.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if we don't go back,
then the plan won't work.

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:21.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
What plan?

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:24.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh no, it's nothing, never mind.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:27.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good afternoon.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Welcome!

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:30.594 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's just you.

00:16:30.694 --> 00:16:33.363 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why would you say
"good afternoon" like that
in your own house?

00:16:33.463 --> 00:16:36.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I'm a customer right
now. I came to buy bread!

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:38.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to buy it,
just take it for free.

00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:40.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not like we're
gonna sell out.

00:16:40.106 --> 00:16:42.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's no good at all!
It's cheating.

00:16:42.243 --> 00:16:43.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll pay like anyone else does.

00:16:43.844 --> 00:16:45.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Okay, okay, fine.

00:16:45.646 --> 00:16:47.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you can be pretty
stubborn sometimes.

00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:49.552 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do whatever you want.

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
But...

00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:53.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
watch out for land mines.

00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:54.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Land mines? Whaddya mean?

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:57.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
You tell her, kid.
You know what I'm saying.

00:16:57.229 --> 00:16:58.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, I don't.
[Akio] (waaahh?!)

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
You liar!
You just don't wanna say it!

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:03.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah...
[Akio] (grrr)

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
Little coward!

00:17:05.573 --> 00:17:08.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right then, I'll just have
to tell her myself.

00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:10.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
By land mine,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
what I'm talking about...

00:17:12.749 --> 00:17:13.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
is...

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae's bread!
[Sanae] (sniffles)

00:17:16.854 --> 00:17:18.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Huh?!

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you saying my bread is...

00:17:21.227 --> 00:17:23.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
nothing but a death trap!

00:17:23.563 --> 00:17:28.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, wait! I love it! Sanae!

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:29.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, now what?

00:17:29.437 --> 00:17:30.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, even if no one's here,

00:17:30.738 --> 00:17:33.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd still like to leave some
money for them.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.282 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:40.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you mind paying
for me, Tomoya?

00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:42.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
You don't have any cash?

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:43.555 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I do...

00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:46.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'd like you to pay
if that's all right.

00:17:46.426 --> 00:17:48.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, do you mind?

00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:50.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nope, don't mind at all.
How much?

00:17:50.332 --> 00:17:52.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's 120 yen.

00:17:52.301 --> 00:17:53.236 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here!

00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:55.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
Perfect, thank you very much.

00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:58.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, how nice of you
to treat me, Tomoya!

00:17:58.775 --> 00:18:01.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you talking about?
You MADE me pay.

00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:04.884 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]
But it's okay, because I know
you won't be upset about it.

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
And why's that?

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Well...

00:18:08.356 --> 00:18:10.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because it's for me, right?

00:18:10.224 --> 00:18:12.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hold on a second.

00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:13.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mind repeating that for me?

00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:15.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can, but I really
don't want to.

00:18:15.899 --> 00:18:18.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I really didn't
understand you.

00:18:18.668 --> 00:18:20.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see. Well, in that case,

00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:23.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I have no choice
but to say it again.

00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:25.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
(deep breath)

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:27.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen closely this time.

00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:28.781 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Okay.

00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:30.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
What I said was,
I know you won't be upset

00:18:30.385 --> 00:18:34.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
because you're buying
the bread for me!

00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:37.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
I said it pretty loud.
You heard me that time, right?

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:39.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, I heard you.

00:18:39.195 --> 00:18:43.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Good, I was afraid
I'd have to say it louder.

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:45.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
So is it good?

00:18:45.637 --> 00:18:48.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so nervous right now,
I can't eveb taste it.

00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:50.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's there to be
nervous about?

00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:52.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I forgot to say my line!

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:57.386 position:5% line:77% align:start
Let's see... Since you bought it
for me, it's, uh, even more
delicious than usual.

00:18:57.485 --> 00:18:59.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:01.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to ask
for a bite, Tomoya.

00:19:01.992 --> 00:19:04.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
It doesn't really work when
you tell me what I want.

00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:06.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, then I'll try to make
it like a question.

00:19:07.066 --> 00:19:09.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, would you like
to have a bite?

00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:10.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:19:10.937 --> 00:19:13.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're really making this
tough on me.

00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:16.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I supposed to say,  yes ?
I get it.

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:17.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
Would you like to have a bite?

00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:19.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I REALLY wanna bite!

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.117 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really? For real?!

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:23.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but you can't have any!
[TOMOYA] (d'oh!)

00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:27.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, are you okay, Tomoya?!
What's wrong?

00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:28.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why can't I have any?

00:19:28.593 --> 00:19:31.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because... because I don't
have enough to share.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fine, then just forget about it.

00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:34.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
That won't do at all!

00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:36.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to come up with
a way for you to enjoy it

00:19:36.371 --> 00:19:37.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
without eating it.

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, whatever makes you happy.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:42.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, then try turning
your head toward me.

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:43.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean, like this?

00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:45.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Perfect!

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
(ahh...)

00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:50.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
(breaths out softly)

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:56.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Um, how was that?

00:19:56.397 --> 00:20:00.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to get a nice
whiff of my cinnamon roll.

00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:04.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, don't just stare!
Say somthing!

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you keep looking at me
like that, I'm gonna cry.

00:20:07.611 --> 00:20:09.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Mei, I see you!
[Nagisa] (startled)

00:20:10.615 --> 00:20:11.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't trick me.
I knew this was your idea!

00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:16.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] You figured it out, huh?

00:20:16.723 --> 00:20:20.895 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course I did!
No matter how you look at it,
it was way too forced.

00:20:20.995 --> 00:20:24.566 position:5% line:83% align:start
Operation Date is complete!
Mei, signing off!

00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:26.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:20:26.102 --> 00:20:29.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come back here, you brat!
[Nagisa] Okazaki!

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:30.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
That little punk!

00:20:31.076 --> 00:20:34.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it. Was Mei
blackmailing you or something?

00:20:34.146 --> 00:20:35.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that it?

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:39.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.
I just...

00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:41.522 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did she say something to you?

00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:42.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
She said...

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
you were selfconscious about
being a delinquent,

00:20:45.094 --> 00:20:47.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you don't want to force
yourself on me.

00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:52.069 position:5% line:77% align:start
And since I'm older than you
are, I should be taking the
initiative in our relationship.

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:54.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I figured it was
something like that.

00:20:54.372 --> 00:20:59.112 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] I was trying to follow
the plan that Mei wrote, but I
kept messing it up.

00:20:59.212 --> 00:21:03.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, this was
really dumb of me.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I agree.

00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:10.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all that, I wouldn't blame
you if you hated me. (huh)

00:21:10.494 --> 00:21:13.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't hate you for all
the bad dates in the world.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:18.103 position:5% line:77% align:start
Besides, even if her methods
were off, I think Mei was
right in a way.

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:21.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, the day's not over
just yet. You have a sec?

00:21:21.274 --> 00:21:24.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, well, I guess I might a
little more time before dinner.

00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:28.917 position:5% line:77% align:start
In that case, why don't you
and I take a little walk
to work up our appetite.

00:21:29.718 --> 00:21:31.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where do you want to go?

00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:34.592 position:5% line:89% align:start
A-anywhere's okay with me.

00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:38.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, as long as I'm with you.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
Glad to hear it.

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:43.336 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, uh...

00:21:46.374 --> 00:21:48.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
let's stay together forever.

00:23:42.326 --> 00:23:44.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>It's been a month</i>
 <i>since I started dating Tomoyo.</i>

00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:46.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It wasn't really planned</i>
 <i>or anything.</i>

00:23:46.864 --> 00:23:48.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>It just sort of happened.</i>

00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:50.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>When I first met her,</i>
 <i>I was always cutting class.</i>

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Even when I did come to school,</i>
 <i>I was late.</i>

00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:55.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But somehow, after getting to</i>
 <i>know her better,</i>

00:23:55.543 --> 00:23:58.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>not only did I start coming</i>
 <i>to school on time,</i>

00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I started falling in love</i>
 <i>with her as well.</i>

00:23:59.749 --> 00:24:03.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, you'll stay with me
from now on too, won't you?

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course.

00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:07.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Guy] You realize the
situation, don't you?

00:24:07.925 --> 00:24:10.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
You understand what kind
of person she is.
