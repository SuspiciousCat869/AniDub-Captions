Kind: captions

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.854 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you need to tell Sanae and
your old man that you're going
to school?

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:08.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Those pictures...
[Tomoya] Yeah?

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:11.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] My father use to
be an actor. I had no idea.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
He was really popular in
student theater back when
he was in high school.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
Apparently, he won a bunch
of competitions, too.

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:21.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
They never said a word to me.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:26.366 position:5% line:77% align:start
I knew my mother used to be a
middle school teacher,. but
that's all they told me.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:35.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
I couldn't help but notice
how happy my parents looked
in all those photos.

00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:38.515 position:5% line:77% align:start
But of course they were happy.
They were living out their
dreams.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:40.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa...
[Nagisa] Not only that,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
it was a happiness that
could've lasted forever.

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:46.324 position:5% line:89% align:start
If only I... was never born.

00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:49.896 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's not true! Besides,
don't you think they're
still happy now?

00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:52.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
But they still had to
give up on their dreams.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
Am I wrong?

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
And look at me... all this time
I've been trying to live out my

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:03.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
dream without ever thinking that
they had to sacrifice theirs.

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I did the same
thing to you too.

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so ungrateful.

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:09.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been such a terrible
daughter to them.

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:13.690 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was so set on my dream,
I've made everyone
else suffer for it.

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:15.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've wasted all their time.

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not a waste.
We wanted to help.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:19.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you get discouraged
and give up now,

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:22.601 position:5% line:77% align:start
then all the work that
everyone's done will
be for nothing.

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:28.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
We all gave it our best to make
it this far. We can't give up!

00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:54.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
I could really go for a nap.

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:56.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not nervous at all,
are you?

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Nagisa, what's wrong?
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's just a little stressed
out about the show, that's all.

00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:04.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Tell them.
[Nagisa] Uh, yeah.

00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:07.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] What's going on?
She's acting kind of strange.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's kind
of a long story.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.126 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just try to act normal, okay?

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:13.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei sighs]

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, let me show you a
little trick for good luck.

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:21.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
Write the character for "person"
on your hand three times.

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:23.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
Person, person, person...

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:26.446 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] That's the character
for "enter," not "person."
[Youhei] Who cares?!

00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:28.782 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Just let me finish!
[Kyou] If you can't
write the kanji,

00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:31.819 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Kyou] then the trick
isn't gonna work.
[Youhei] It's the thought
that counts, okay?!

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.856 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Oh, give me a break!
[Youhei] What does it
matter to you, anyway?!

00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:36.324 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our performance isn't til later.

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:37.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
You wanna walk around
for a little bit?

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Oh yeah, I should
probably show Mei around.

00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:44.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then we'll just do our own thing
until the performance, okay?

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:45.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] So, what do
you wanna check out?

00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:49.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:51.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, uh wait,
what was that?

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:58.618 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry. I know I need to
keep it together for the
performance today...

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I still have a lot
of stuff on my mind.

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:05.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I took what you
said earlier to heart.

00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:08.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
The thing about us all working
on the play together, I mean.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.435 position:5% line:77% align:start
It wouldn't be fair to everyone
else if I ruined the show
just 'cause I was upset.

00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:15.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hpmh. That's right,
just hang in there.

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:17.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Right.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:41.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki?

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now where the heck
did she run off to?

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:45.709 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya gasp]

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sanae!

00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:49.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hello Okazaki!

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, didn't you bring
the old man with you?

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:54.419 position:5% line:83% align:start
Akio? No, he told me to go
ahead on my own for now.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think he'll actually come?

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Don't worry about it.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.692 position:5% line:83% align:start
He wouldn't miss Nagisa's
performance for the world,

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure of it.

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] So, she knows
everything now, huh?

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] By the time I found
her, it was already too late.

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:10.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] What's Nagisa
doing right now?

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know, we got separated.

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:14.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] I see.

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mrs. Isogai] Mrs. Furukawa?

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:18.415 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Mrs. Isogai.

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:20.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'll see you later,
Okazaki.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:23.989 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Nagisa's nervous, so
please take care of her, okay?

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:41.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Excuse me...

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Furukawa.

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:46.382 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now what brings you here today?

00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:48.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I uh...

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.092 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm looking for something
Okazaki mentioned to
me a while back.

00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:57.730 position:5% line:77% align:start
You have a lot of materials
from old high school
plays here, right?

00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:02.903 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you need to use something
as a reference for your show?

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:04.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes...
[Yukine] I'm looking forward

00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:06.908 position:5% line:83% align:start
to seeing you perform
this afternoon.

00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:08.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
Break a leg out there, okay?

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right...

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but I need
to step out for a bit.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.021 position:5% line:77% align:start
Still, feel free to look
through anything you
like while I'm gone.

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:20.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:28.134 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miyazawa!

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:29.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi Okazaki.

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:31.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have you seen Nagisa anywhere?

00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:33.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Oh, she's looking
through some materials from

00:07:33.207 --> 00:07:35.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
the old High School Theater
in the second library.

00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:38.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya gasp]

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:40.715 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio, as Oedipus] Whoever
the man is who freed my feet,
[Tomoya] Nagisa!

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:44.352 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] who released me
from that cruel shackle
and rescued me from death,

00:07:44.453 --> 00:07:47.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
may that man die!
It was a thankless act.

00:07:47.824 --> 00:07:50.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
Had I perished then, I would
not have come to kill my father,

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:54.966 position:5% line:77% align:start
and men would not see
in me the husband of the
woman who gave birth to me.

00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:58.003 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya gasp]
This is your dad's...
[Akio's performance continues]

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:02.175 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's a video of Dad acting
in a play back when he
was in high school.

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:06.446 position:5% line:77% align:start
He won an award for this
performance in the drama
competition that year.

00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:09.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is there for me
to see, my friends?

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:13.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
With such stains upon me,
could I look into your eyes?

00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:16.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
Apollo brought upon me
these awful things I suffer,

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:19.629 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] but the hand that stabbed
out my eyes was mine alone.
[Nagisa] He's really good.

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.965 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] When this was filmed,
he was a senior. Just like me.
[Akio] Men of Thebes!

00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:24.335 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Akio] I am Oedipus,
your fallen king!
[Nagisa] There's a
world of diffence.

00:08:24.434 --> 00:08:26.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can't even compare us.

00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:29.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Audience applauding in video]

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now let's have Furukawa,
the president of the Drama Club,

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:36.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
say a few words
about their win.

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go ahead.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio inhales sharply]

00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.557 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love being an actooor! Yeaaah!

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna keep doing theater
for the rest of my life!

00:08:45.328 --> 00:08:47.864 position:5% line:77% align:start
Not only that, one day,
I'm gonna become a
professional actor!

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:51.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
Haha! This is just
the beginning!

00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:53.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
[M.C.] Well, that certainly
is a nice aspiration,

00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:56.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
but could you please give us a
few words as club president?

00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:58.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
Live theater is the beeeeest!

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:03.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're you, Nagisa.

00:09:03.182 --> 00:09:06.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just have to do what
you can do and nothing else.

00:09:06.353 --> 00:09:07.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Am I right?

00:09:16.065 --> 00:09:18.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Applause]

00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:21.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Applause]

00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:25.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
[M.C] And that concludes our
performance from the Choir Club.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:30.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next is a solo play, written and
performed by Nagisa Furukawa,

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:32.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
and presented by the drama club.

00:09:32.784 --> 00:09:35.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please standby while
the stage is set.

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Nagisa!

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.274 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's time for your big debut!

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:54.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't be nervous. I'm sure
you're going to be a big hit!

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:57.782 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Just do it like you
did in the dress rehearsal
and you'll be fine.

00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:00.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Don't freak out, okay?
Let's just have fun.

00:10:00.618 --> 00:10:01.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Botan] Puhi, puhi!

00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:18.740 position:5% line:77% align:start
[M.C.] Thanks for waiting.
The Drama Club will now
present "Fantasia Story."

00:10:19.342 --> 00:10:20.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Nagisa...</i>

00:10:20.977 --> 00:10:22.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Here we go!</i>

[Girl 2] Stage fright, maybe?

00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:03.995 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on. You can do this.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:06.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Nagisa's
acting strange.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Do you think
she's just nervous?

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
What now, Okazaki?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Should we
drop the curtain?

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:15.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It'll be fine.

00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:17.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
She can do this, I know it!

[Youhei] This is bad!
Drop the curtain.

00:12:08.107 --> 00:12:09.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya!

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
Make your dream come true,
Nagisaaaaaa!

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] What the?!
[Tomoya] Old man?

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you stupid or what?!

00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:37.610 position:5% line:77% align:start
A child's dream IS their
parents' dream. You can
make it come true for us!

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:41.381 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you realize that our
dream is to watch you live
out YOUR dream!?

00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:43.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your mom and I didn't
give up our dreams at all!

00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
You get it, Nagisa?
You ARE our dream!

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:49.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what being
parents is all about!

00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:52.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what being a
family is all about!

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since then... ever
since that day...

00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:58.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
we've been baking our bread...

00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:02.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
waiting, longing
for today to come!

00:13:02.173 --> 00:13:05.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you get discouraged and give
up now, then all our dreams die!

00:13:05.344 --> 00:13:06.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
You got that!?

00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:10.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is your responsibility now!
Get it!?

00:13:10.216 --> 00:13:14.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae, you're here, aren't you?
You tell her, too!

00:13:14.153 --> 00:13:16.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] You can do it, Nagisa!

00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:19.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? What's going on?

00:13:19.594 --> 00:13:20.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya!
[Kotomi] Huh?

00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:24.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] The same goes
for us too, Nagisa!

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:29.206 position:5% line:77% align:start
What you're trying to make
happen right now is what
Sunohara and I couldn't do!

00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:31.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of our failures
and frustrations

00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:33.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
are resting on your
shoulders now!

00:13:54.102 --> 00:13:59.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa inhales, then exhales]

00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:08.621 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] If you'd like...

00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:11.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you'd like,
shall I take you...?

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:17.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
To the place... in town,
where wishes come true?

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Take us there, Nagisa!</i>

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:21.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Take all of us.</i>

00:14:22.837 --> 00:14:26.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is a world that
has come to an end.

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:29.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
An empty and still world
where no one exists but I.

00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:33.417 position:5% line:77% align:start
There is small table
and chair in this room,
but outside the window...

00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:38.390 position:5% line:77% align:start
there is nothing but an empty
plain, stretching into an
endless horizon.

00:14:39.624 --> 00:14:40.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
This building is old.

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:43.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know how long
ago it was built.

00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:48.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
I live here alone,
passing time in solitude.

00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:53.341 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sometimes I venture outside,
picking up little odds and
ends that I might need.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, there is no
one outside, either...

00:14:58.748 --> 00:15:03.387 position:5% line:77% align:start
but under the fading sun,
a sea of tiny lights are
fluttering about.

00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:07.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
Amidst those lights,
I picked up wood scraps,

00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:10.161 position:5% line:89% align:start
nails and many other things.

00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:12.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
My purpose was to
create a friend.

00:15:13.065 --> 00:15:15.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
But now... even as
I construct him,

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:19.172 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wonder if anyone would be
happy to be born in a
world like this.

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:23.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
At every turn, those feelings
of doubt still haunt me.

00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:29.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] This world indeed</i>

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:41.099 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>in the distant future...</i>

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I was in a different world.</i>

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:49.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But I can no longer</i>

00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:53.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Because now I exist inside this</i>

00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:55.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:59.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
Should I... make another?

00:16:01.957 --> 00:16:05.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
But why? It won't
be able to move.

00:16:05.228 --> 00:16:08.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't do it.
We can't make friends.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you don't want me to
make a friend this time?

00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:17.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something else?

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:21.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] I don't know what,</i>
 <i>but we have to make something.</i>

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:27.489 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>She can create something</i>

 <i>just like she created me.</i>

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:31.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>We can't let that special</i>

00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:33.396 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:33.497 --> 00:16:35.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we try hard enough,
with time,

00:16:35.432 --> 00:16:38.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
we may be able to make
something truly wonderful.

00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:43.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well what shall we make then?

00:16:46.512 --> 00:16:47.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girl gasp]

00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:49.649 position:5% line:89% align:start

 <i>[Voice] Something that</i>

00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:17.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Audience applauding]

00:17:29.096 --> 00:17:31.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I remembered the rest.
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] The rest of
the story, I mean.

00:17:33.603 --> 00:17:36.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eventually, the girl and
the little doll decide

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
to leave that sad
and empty world behind.

00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:41.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Cause the little doll knew
that somewhere, far, far away,

00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
there was another world
for them to live in.

00:17:43.848 --> 00:17:45.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
One full of warmth and life.

00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:47.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what happens then?

00:17:47.887 --> 00:17:51.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
They set out on a long, long
journey... and at the end

00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
And at the end?

00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:54.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] They sing a song.

00:17:55.629 --> 00:17:56.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
You serious?

00:17:56.564 --> 00:17:57.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course I am.

00:17:57.665 --> 00:17:59.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
They sing a song at the
end of the journey,

00:17:59.534 --> 00:18:01.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I sang a song at
the end of the play.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why else do you think I would
do something like that?

00:18:03.873 --> 00:18:06.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, I'll give you that,
but I doubt she would've

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:08.111 position:5% line:89% align:start
sang the Big Dango Family song.

00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:10.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, no, that part was just me.

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:11.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know everyone
applauded and all,

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I think they were a little
confused by the ending.

00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:18.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
That song kind of ruined the
whole emotional build up.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just really wanted
to sing it, that's all.

00:18:23.596 --> 00:18:25.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, whatever.

00:18:25.499 --> 00:18:27.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
Other than the song,
the play was great.

00:18:28.036 --> 00:18:29.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you really mean it?

00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:30.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never flatter people.

00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:32.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know that.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I do.

00:18:33.709 --> 00:18:36.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I was surprised
to hear you say that.

00:18:41.418 --> 00:18:43.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm glad
to see you came.

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:46.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
I got an invitation, after all.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:50.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry if I was out of
line by telling him... but...

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:53.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought he should know what
was going on at least.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] I saw the
play this afternoon.

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a wonderful story.

00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:58.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:02.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
It made me think a lot about
the past, in a good way.

00:19:06.281 --> 00:19:08.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I suppose I
should be going now.

00:19:08.718 --> 00:19:10.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:12.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't drink too much, all right?

00:19:12.723 --> 00:19:13.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoyuki gasp]

00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:21.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki...?

00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:26.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, you wanna go
somewhere with me tomorrow?

00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:29.143 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?
[Tomoya] It's a three-day
weekend, right?

00:19:29.242 --> 00:19:31.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
It'd be nice if it
was just us two.

00:19:31.312 --> 00:19:32.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's something
I wanna talk about.

00:19:33.082 --> 00:19:34.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Talk about?
[Kyou] Ah ha!

00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:35.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] So there you are!

00:19:35.517 --> 00:19:37.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone's waiting
in the club room.

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:40.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't start the party without
the director and the big star!

00:19:40.924 --> 00:19:42.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry 'bout that.

00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:43.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:45.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:09.793 position:5% line:11% align:start
Don't we need to get
permission to go inside
the school like this?

00:20:09.893 --> 00:20:13.363 position:5% line:11% align:start
[Tomoya] Whatever,
we're students here,
so I'm sure it's fine.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:14.899 position:5% line:17% align:start
[Nagisa] I guess you're right.

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:20.005 position:5% line:17% align:start
[Tomoya] Yanno, lately...
[Nagisa] Hm?

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:23.609 position:5% line:11% align:start
Lately, I've been starting
to feel like this school
isn't so bad after all.

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:26.846 position:5% line:17% align:start
Well, is that so? I'm happy
to hear you say that.

00:20:27.948 --> 00:20:30.951 position:5% line:17% align:start
Huh? I'm the class monitor?!
Since when?

00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:34.122 position:5% line:11% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh yeah, I put
that up there as a joke
when you were absent.

00:20:34.222 --> 00:20:35.390 position:5% line:17% align:start
Forgot about that.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.027 position:5% line:17% align:start
And all this time
I never noticed it.

00:20:39.262 --> 00:20:40.596 position:5% line:17% align:start
Hm...

00:20:52.244 --> 00:20:54.914 position:27% line:71% align:start
 There, we're even now.
  [giggles]

00:20:55.282 --> 00:20:56.615 position:5% line:71% align:start
Ah!

00:20:59.786 --> 00:21:02.523 position:5% line:71% align:start
I said before that we had
something to talk about...

00:21:02.623 --> 00:21:04.759 position:5% line:71% align:start
Yeah? Is something
on your mind?

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.664 position:5% line:11% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, uh... I'm
not sure how to say this.
[Nagisa] Hm?

00:21:12.368 --> 00:21:15.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
Uh... Wouldn't it be funny...

00:21:15.172 --> 00:21:18.709 position:5% line:71% align:start
if we woke up tomorrow and we
were boyfriend and girlfriend?

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:19.945 position:5% line:77% align:start
Huh?

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.854 position:5% line:77% align:start
Will you go out with me, Nagisa?

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:30.257 position:5% line:77% align:start
I love you, Nagisa.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:34.629 position:5% line:11% align:start
So I... I want to spend
every day of my life
together with you.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.557 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
Okazaki said he was going
over to Sunohara's.

00:23:48.658 --> 00:23:50.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it, Okazaki?

00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:54.732 position:5% line:77% align:start
Lately...I've had these thoughts
about you that I just can't
get out of my head.

00:23:54.832 --> 00:23:56.168 position:5% line:89% align:start
Seem to be enjoying themselves.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:59.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I ask, do you think
they'll let me join in maybe?

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:01.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's nobody around,
don't worry about it.

00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:03.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
You tell her, kid.
You know what I'm saying.

00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:05.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
What, are you in grade school?

00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:06.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, then...

00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:08.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll just have
to tell her myself.

00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:10.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
Man, that's getting
me worked up!
