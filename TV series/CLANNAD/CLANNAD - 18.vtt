[Tomoyo] It's morning,
Okazaki. Wake up.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:13.991 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya grumbles]

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.799 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] What are you...
doing here?
[Tomoyo] What do you think?

00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm here to wake you up,
of course.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.336 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Where's my dad?

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:58.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I'm not sure.
He wasn't here when I showed up.

00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hm...
[Tomoyo] Hm?

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, you ended up
making me breakfast.

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it was a pain.

00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:05.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who should be sorry.
If I'd been more careful,

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
then you wouldn't be in
trouble right now.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:09.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't say that.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know it was your choice,
but I should have

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:13.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
been suspended, not you.

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I'm still
torn up about all this.

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:18.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
I appreciate what you did,
but I can't help but feel

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
like I should go to the office
and tell them the truth.

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:22.098 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's the last
thing you should do.

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:24.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like I said, no matter
what else happens,

00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:27.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
you have to be elected
student council president.

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:28.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
For the Drama Club, right?

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
But still, even if I-wha...?
[Light thud]

00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:33.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoyuki] Oh, what have we here?

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Oh, good morning, sir!

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you sit down and
have breakfast with us?

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
That would be nice.
We haven't had a real

00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
breakfast like this
in a quite a while.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:46.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here, I'll sit down
next to Tomoya.

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:49.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for the food.
It was good.

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, wait. What's wrong?

00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:02.175 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei snoring]

00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:05.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei, mumbling] You punks...

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara, wake up!

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Whaddya want?
It's too early.

00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:16.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] A girl's here to
confess her love to you.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you for real?!

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
WA-HOO!

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:21.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
BLAST OFF!

00:03:21.797 --> 00:03:24.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rugby jock] Hey! What the
hell is that on your head?

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Huh?! What?!
[Tomoya] The Rugby Club?

00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rugby jock] What?
Are you a panty thief?

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:29.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, those are boxers!

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:31.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
You freakin' pervert!

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:33.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Loud fighting sounds]
[Youhei screams]

00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:36.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
Chance can be a scary thing.

00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:37.915 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, is that your idea of fun?

00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:39.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Pretty much.
[Youhei growls]

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, if nothing else,
at least it woke you up.

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:45.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
Woke me up?! Are you kidding?!
That guy knocked me out!

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:48.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'm about to
head off to school.

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:50.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
You gonna stay here all day?

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:54.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, say hi to Kyou
and the others for me.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.671 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] I see. So he took
the blame for Sakagami
and was suspended.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyaaa, why can't you
take care of yourself?

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you think Tomoya
will be okay?

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, will he still be able
to graduate after all this?

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know, but
I'm really worried.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
The club leader is absent
and Tomoya's suspended.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:16.590 position:5% line:77% align:start
At this rate, how are we
supposed to be in the
School Festival?

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] It's already</i>
 <i>been three days already.</i>

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:29.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Why is she the only</i>
 <i>thing I can think about?</i>

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:31.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Knocks at the door]
[Tomoya gasp]

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:34.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Kyou] Hi there!

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have you been lonely without us?

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:38.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard about what happened.
It's a real shame.

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wasn't expecting you guys.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
What does that mean?
Who were you expecting?

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, no one really.

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:48.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] You're under suspension.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you really go out like this?

00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:51.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aren't you suppose
to be staying at home?

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:53.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
You say that, and yet,
you were the one who

00:04:53.163 --> 00:04:54.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
invited me in the first place.

00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:56.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, Kyou,
where are we going?

00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:57.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's a...

00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
good question.

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:01.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow. This
thing's pretty cool.

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:05.010 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Well, if nothing
else, Ryou can get her
fortune-telling fix.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, now you enter your name.

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:09.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Um... how do I...?
[Tomoya chuckles]

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.117 position:5% line:89% align:start
Use this thing right here.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:12.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, right!

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wait, that's
the symbol for male.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Aah...

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:19.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya & Kyou] Oh!

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:21.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, what's our relationship?

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hm, well, let's see.

00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:24.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] U-um...

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:27.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Come on, hurry it up!
[Ryou] Kyou, what are you-?!

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:31.005 position:5% line:77% align:start
It says you're
suppose to put your
hands together when you play.

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:32.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry about this.

00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:33.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's alright.
I don't mind.

00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:37.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, there.

00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:46.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
C-come on! What's
wrong with you?!

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.524 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Whoa! Hold on!

00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:50.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn it, Kyou! That hurt!

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:53.296 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] O-oh yeah?!
Well, that's what you
get for ruining the mood!

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:55.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to pick
"lover" not "friend",

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
otherwise it's not any fun!
Everyone knows that!

00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:04.408 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] "A kind female and
a male with a strong sense
of responsibility.

00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:07.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
You will be very compatible
friends. However,

00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:10.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
whether it develops beyond this
is up to each individual."

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can't get anymore generic
than that, can you?

00:06:13.418 --> 00:06:15.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aren't all fortunes like that?
What'd you expect?

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:20.760 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Ryou] But still,</i>
 <i>I'm glad it didn't say</i>
 <i>we were totally incompatible.</i>

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.696 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Hey, Kyou?
[Kyou] I have to run an errand,
so I'm leaving.

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.898 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya, make sure
Ryou gets home safe.

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:32.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're really into
that fortune-telling stuff, huh?

00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:36.244 position:5% line:77% align:start
I think girls are genetically
predisposed to be interested
in fortune telling.

00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:38.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, too bad your
fortune telling is so-

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:40.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I mean...

00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:43.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou chuckles]
It's okay. I know I'm bad at it.

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:45.853 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Wait, you
know you're bad?
[Ryou] I have to admit,

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:48.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm still a little
disappointed sometimes,

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.360 position:5% line:77% align:start
but in the end, I think
it actually works out
better this way.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why's that?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.768 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rou] If a prediction is right,

00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:02.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
then it's like you
only have one future.

00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:04.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like that future
has been decided.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:09.246 position:5% line:77% align:start
But if it's wrong, then
you have an almost infinite
number of possibilities.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:14.484 position:5% line:77% align:start
And that means that even the
tiniest twist of fate can
change your future.

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:16.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to believe
that I have choices.

00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:19.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
That the path I walk has
many different turns,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
and many different
roads to follow.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to come
here on Sundays too.

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:34.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I wanna come here on Sundays,
then it's my choice.

00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:35.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where's my dad?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
He went out a little while ago.

00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:40.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you don't get along
with him very well, do you?

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:45.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, that's none
of my business, is it?

00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:51.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
How's the student
council campaign going?

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:53.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's almost election day, right?

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:57.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] It's going well,
don't worry.

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Doorbell rings]

00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:02.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
Morning, Tomoya! We thought you
might appreciate a little snack!

00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:04.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boton] Boi, boi!
[Tomoya] Thank you.

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but my sister
insisted on coming.

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:09.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, uh, whatever.

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:10.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Okazaki,
what's going on?

00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:13.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Oh, visitors?
[Kyou] It's you?!

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:16.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya. Oh, hi Kyou, hi Ryou.

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:18.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a lovely morning, isn't it?

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:21.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
No offense, Kotomi,
but what are you doing here?

00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought Tomoya must be hungry
with no one to cook for him.

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:28.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I thought I would stop
by and bring him some lunch.

00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:37.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why does everyone
look so gloomy now?

00:08:37.943 --> 00:08:40.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boton] Poi...
[Tomoya] N-no offense,

00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
but there's no way I
can eat all this food.

00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:45.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ryou and I got up at
5 AM to prepare this.

00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:47.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
You will eat it, now won't you?

00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:50.522 position:5% line:77% align:start
Since I'm the reason Okazaki
was suspended, I'm the
only one involved.

00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:52.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my duty to take
care of his food.

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:54.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you mean
"only one involved"?

00:08:54.327 --> 00:08:56.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to say we
have nothing to do with this?

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:58.165 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be perfectly blunt,
no you don't.

00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:01.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
As far as this incident is
concerned, you're all outsiders.

00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:03.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've known Okazaki
since his junior year.

00:09:03.737 --> 00:09:05.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
And are you saying the drama
club doesn't count for anything?

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:09.110 position:5% line:77% align:start
Time and titles don't determine
the strength of someone's
friendship.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou growls]

00:09:10.477 --> 00:09:11.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
N-now come on you guys,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's no need to
get so riled up.

00:09:14.015 --> 00:09:16.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Both] It's because you
won't make up your mind!

00:09:16.318 --> 00:09:18.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
But that would be even worse.

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:22.024 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fujibayashi, please say
something to these two.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:25.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to eat
my cooking as well!

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:26.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?!
[Botan] Poi?!

00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:32.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:33.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, Tomoya?

00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:34.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi...

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:37.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yanno, I started
prepping last night,

00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:39.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I put a lot of work
into cooking all this.

00:09:41.778 --> 00:09:44.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko... has... arrived!

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.751 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:48.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
I brought my own home
cooking for you to eat too!

00:09:49.053 --> 00:09:51.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
Leave it to me! My food will
make everything better, Okazaki!

00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:53.524 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No, seriously, stop!

00:09:53.624 --> 00:09:55.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, I understand
how you must feel,

00:09:55.995 --> 00:10:00.165 position:5% line:77% align:start
but unfortuately,
my home cooking is the
only choice for you, Okazaki!

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:01.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
Starfish pastry!

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Starfish cupcakes!

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
Starfish creme puffs!

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's gross.

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:08.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Okazaki...

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
please eat my boxed lunch.
I made it just for you.

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
You won't let my work
go to waste, will you?

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make up your mind, already.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pick my food or else.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Botan] Boi, boi...

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Mine is the
obvious choice, Okazaki!

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:22.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Botan] Poi?

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] The obvious choice!

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:29.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Greetings, Captain!

00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:32.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations
and welcome back!

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:33.902 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Go easy on me, okay?

00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:37.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
I ate way too much yesterday
and I feel I'm gonna puke.

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:40.843 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hate to say it, but this is no
time to be sitting on your
ass and complaining.

00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:43.414 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Tomoyo's in
big trouble right now.
[Tomoya] Huh?!

00:10:43.514 --> 00:10:45.648 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl] Is this true?
[Boy 1] I don't know,
but I heard she was

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:47.151 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 1] in a gang before
she came here.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 2] Just the other day,
some punks from another

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:51.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
school came to pick
a fight with her.

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:53.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 3] You sure? I thought
they were after Okazaki?

00:10:53.824 --> 00:10:54.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy 2] I wonder...

00:10:54.992 --> 00:10:56.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shut up! He's standing
right there.

00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:58.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 2 gasp]
[Youhei] There you have it.

00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what's the plan?

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:01.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:05.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? You wanna have a match?

00:11:05.303 --> 00:11:07.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and if we lose,
we'll pick up balls for you,

00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:10.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
or clean your uniforms,
or whatever you like.

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:16.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just wait here a sec.
I'll see what the team thinks.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
You think you can clean up her
image with a baseball game?

00:11:19.286 --> 00:11:21.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
If playing basketball works,
then why not?

00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:22.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just trust me on this one.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:24.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, but I'll warn you.

00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:26.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
The most I've ever
done is play catch.

00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't worry, okay?

00:11:27.594 --> 00:11:28.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
We have an ace up our sleeves.

00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:31.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our buddy Sunohara there,
is an athletic wonder.

00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:33.101 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now I'm really worried.

00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Captain] Okazaki!

00:11:35.203 --> 00:11:36.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a deal.

00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:38.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
We only have one condition.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:43.812 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you guys lose the game,
then Sakagami will have to
join the girls' softball team.

00:11:48.485 --> 00:11:49.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll do it.

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:58.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo, all we need is
three outs to take this!

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:02.632 position:5% line:77% align:start
But try to be careful,
'cause if they get a
base hit, we're finished!

00:12:02.732 --> 00:12:05.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right! I'll give
it my best shot!

00:12:05.302 --> 00:12:06.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon! Gimme a pitch!

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:13.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! You okay over there?

00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:16.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:19.585 position:5% line:83% align:start
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Tomoyo?!

00:12:19.684 --> 00:12:21.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shut up! You're distracting me!

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:23.755 position:5% line:83% align:start
What, are you afraid I might
catch the ball or something?!

00:12:23.855 --> 00:12:25.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
Start throwing strikes!

00:12:25.525 --> 00:12:27.260 position:5% line:89% align:start
Watch it, guys! Pitcher's wild!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
Calm down, Tomoyo.

00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:31.264 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Sunohara's bugging me,
and I can't concentrate.

00:12:31.364 --> 00:12:34.000 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then try throwing the
ball straight at his
annoying little face,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
like you're gonna smash it
and knock his teeth out.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.506 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] Straight at his face?
[Youhei] C'mon! You
couldn't even pitch a tent!

00:12:39.606 --> 00:12:41.341 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, here goes nothing.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've seen better arms
on a beanbag chair!

00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:51.853 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Wha- YAAAAHOOOOOO!

00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:55.823 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eh, um... strike.

00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:58.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yells] Ow!

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yells]

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.900 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yells]

00:13:05.602 --> 00:13:07.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Umpire] Strike! You're out!

00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:08.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
That felt good!

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's great, Tomoyo! We won!

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:14.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 1] Did you hear about
what happened with Tomoyo?

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:17.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
She challenged the baseball
team to a game and won!

00:13:17.348 --> 00:13:20.850 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl 1] Wow, that's
awesome! She's good at
everything, isn't she?

00:13:20.952 --> 00:13:22.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl 2] Look, she's
right over there!

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:24.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoyo!

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:28.427 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl 3] Wow!
[Girls jabber and
cheer excitedly]

00:13:28.527 --> 00:13:32.297 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thanks to you, all those
nasty rumors about me have
finally been cleared up.

00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:34.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I'm grateful.
[Tomoya] Don't mention it.

00:13:34.132 --> 00:13:36.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just doing it for
the Drama Club, after all.

00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:37.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
I still appreciate it though.

00:13:37.903 --> 00:13:41.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now it looks like my dream
might actually come true.

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:43.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What dream?
[Tomoyo] Oh yeah.

00:13:43.309 --> 00:13:45.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess I haven't mentioned
it to you yet, huh?

00:13:48.314 --> 00:13:50.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wanna protect these cherry
trees, no matter what.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.121 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Tomoyo] They're planning
to cut them all down.

00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
Students who know about
it are really sad.

00:13:56.725 --> 00:13:59.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
The neighborhood is also
opposed to the plan.

00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:01.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I become the next
student council president,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.899 position:5% line:77% align:start
then hopefully I can start
a movement to save the
cherry trees.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.804 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a sec. Are you telling me
that was the only reason you
transferred to this school?

00:14:10.238 --> 00:14:11.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm.

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:15.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
This place holds special
memories for me.

00:14:16.012 --> 00:14:18.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why I have to protect it.

00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:24.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, what were you
like in the past?

00:14:24.987 --> 00:14:27.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
Average, I guess.

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:30.794 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was... a rebel.

00:14:30.894 --> 00:14:32.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why do we rebel?

00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or, if you wanna look
at it the other way,

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
what is it that stops
people from rebelling?

00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:38.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe talent? 'Cause
if you're talented,

00:14:42.474 --> 00:14:44.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's obvious what you
should do with yourself.

00:14:44.343 --> 00:14:46.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have a path to follow,
yanno?

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:47.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Good answer.

00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:50.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what if you can't
find your talent?

00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:51.383 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:14:51.483 --> 00:14:53.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe... love?

00:14:53.252 --> 00:14:57.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see. I think that one's
a good answer too.

00:14:57.424 --> 00:15:00.960 position:5% line:83% align:start
But in my case, the answer
that I found is family.

00:15:01.061 --> 00:15:04.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the sake of your family,
you try to restrain yourself.

00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:06.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
That might be true for some
people, but what if your

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:08.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
family is the reason you
rebel in the first place?

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:12.173 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] When I say "family",
I-I don't necessarily mean
your real family.

00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:14.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
It could be you friends instead.

00:15:14.342 --> 00:15:18.079 position:5% line:77% align:start
All that matters is that
you have something like
a family to support you.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, I-I don't expect
everyone to feel the same way.

00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:23.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
but this is the answer I've
found for myself, at least.

00:15:25.655 --> 00:15:28.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
Growing up, my parents
never seemed to get along.

00:15:28.424 --> 00:15:31.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
There wasn't even an ounce
of warmth between them.

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
There was nothing at all. They
didn't even bother to fight.

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:38.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Neither of them were to blame.
It's just that as time went on,

00:15:38.335 --> 00:15:40.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
little misunderstandings
turned into big grudges,

00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:44.174 position:5% line:77% align:start
and before they realized it,
their relationship had
fallen apart.

00:15:45.476 --> 00:15:48.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
Back then, I used to
rebel all the time.

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:51.616 position:5% line:77% align:start
I took out my anger
and frustration on
anyone I could find.

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was such a weak person.

00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:59.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
But finally, someone
opened my eyes.

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was my little brother.

00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:05.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was always quiet
and reserved,

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:09.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if you got to know him,
he was very kind-hearted.

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was a good kid, but I
was a bad sister to him.

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:17.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I think back on it,
I'd never once seen him smile.

00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:22.350 position:5% line:77% align:start
Two years ago, my parents
reached their breaking point
and decided to get a divorce.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.687 position:5% line:77% align:start
As a result, my brother
and I were locked in a
bitter custody battle.

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:30.191 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was ready for the
whole ordeal to be over,
so I didn't care either way,

00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:33.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he was still young and
couldn't deal with it.

00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:36.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
He put his foot down and refused
to go with either of them.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.837 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was the first time he
had ever spoken up about
the whole situation.

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
And then...

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] He jumped?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Yeah.

00:16:46.543 --> 00:16:48.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
He said if my parents were
going to get a divorce,

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:52.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
he would jump off a bridge.
And he did.

00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:55.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
To this day, I can't
really say why he did it.

00:16:55.985 --> 00:16:58.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not that he wanted
to die or anything.

00:16:58.522 --> 00:17:02.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
The truth is, I doubt even HE
understood why he jumped.

00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:05.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
But regardless of the reason...
because of what he did,

00:17:05.697 --> 00:17:10.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
we were able to become a real
family for the first time.

00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:13.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
All the distance that we
had put between each other...

00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:15.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
suddenly seemed to disappear.

00:17:19.178 --> 00:17:22.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fortunately, my brother
survived the incident,

00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:25.452 position:5% line:83% align:start
and in the spring, he was
released from the hospital.

00:17:25.552 --> 00:17:28.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was when we first
walked down this path.

00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:31.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
I still remember what
he said that day.

00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:35.830 position:5% line:77% align:start
"I want to see the cherry
blossoms every year...
as a family."

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course... I felt the same
way. And so did my parents.

00:17:44.874 --> 00:17:48.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
This town is always changing...
but there are still a lot of

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:52.448 position:5% line:77% align:start
people here who cherish these
cherry trees and don't
want to see them go.

00:17:52.548 --> 00:17:56.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not the only one. And even
if our reasons are different,

00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
our feelings are the same.

00:17:58.387 --> 00:18:01.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter how cold and
distant people may become,

00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
on the inside, something warm
and precious always remains.

00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:07.397 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something that never changes.

00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:10.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
To me, that's what
family is like.

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:15.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Nagisa, wow!
Welcome back!

00:18:15.874 --> 00:18:18.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you again!

00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:20.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad you're
finally feeling better.

00:18:20.679 --> 00:18:23.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry I
made you all worry.

00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:25.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki?

00:18:25.751 --> 00:18:27.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What-what's up?

00:18:27.787 --> 00:18:29.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry about what happened.

00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard about the big fight,
and how you let yourself

00:18:31.223 --> 00:18:34.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
get suspended so Sakagami
could win the election.

00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:37.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
I... I don't know how
to make it up to you.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah, it's fine. It's not
like I did it just for you.

00:18:41.635 --> 00:18:43.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
I did it for everyone
in the Drama Club.

00:18:43.537 --> 00:18:45.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
Geez, when you  put it
that way, it's like saying

00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:47.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
"You guys really
owe me big time."

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:49.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh! No, I...

00:18:49.811 --> 00:18:51.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, it's all over now.

00:18:51.512 --> 00:18:53.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you want to
take responsibility,

00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:55.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
you can go help Tomoyo
in her match today.

00:18:55.617 --> 00:18:56.751 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, right!

00:18:59.387 --> 00:19:03.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
One-set match. If I win,
then you join the Tennis Club.

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:06.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a deal. Let's do our best.

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:08.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
It'd be hotter if she was
playing another girl.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:12.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm worried. Do you think
Sakagami will be okay?

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't think so many
people would come to watch.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou gasp]

00:19:18.342 --> 00:19:19.743 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Okazaki...

00:19:19.843 --> 00:19:21.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's it!

00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:23.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes!
[Nagisa giggles]

00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:25.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyou, hold on.

00:19:26.283 --> 00:19:29.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just... wait until
the match ends.

00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:37.830 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You're looking good.
You can take it.
[Tomoyo] Thanks.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.598 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Uhm, Sakagami?
[Youhei] Don't they
switch sides now?

00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:40.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I brought some water.
[Tomoya] Oh, yeah, right.

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:41.867 position:5% line:77% align:start
Would you like a drink?

00:19:41.968 --> 00:19:44.303 position:5% line:77% align:start
Not right now. Thanks, though.

00:19:44.403 --> 00:19:47.172 position:5% line:71% align:start
Wait a sec. We've met before,
haven't we?

00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:48.942 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm Nagisa Furukawa.

00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:51.511 position:5% line:71% align:start
I'm trying to organize
the Drama Club.

00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:52.746 position:5% line:77% align:start
Drama Club?

00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:56.884 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, I see. So that's how it is.

00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:58.284 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Hm?
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:19:58.385 --> 00:19:59.787 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, it's nothing.

00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:01.222 position:5% line:77% align:start
Here I go.

00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:29.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh?!
[ball hits Nagisa]

00:20:29.887 --> 00:20:31.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa!
[Boy 1] Ah! What happened?

00:20:31.422 --> 00:20:33.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Nagisa!
[Tennis Capt] Are you okay?!

00:20:33.223 --> 00:20:34.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Nagisa?

00:20:34.992 --> 00:20:36.627 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you all right, Nagisa?!

00:20:36.727 --> 00:20:38.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:20:38.395 --> 00:20:41.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
More importantly, Sakagami
just won a point, right?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ooow!

00:20:44.069 --> 00:20:45.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
That looks bad.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon, the nurse can-

00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:53.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
O-Okazaki...?

00:20:56.482 --> 00:20:57.917 position:5% line:77% align:start
Let's go see the nurse.

00:20:58.018 --> 00:20:59.719 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, right. Okay.

00:21:02.354 --> 00:21:03.724 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Try to take it slow.

00:21:03.824 --> 00:21:04.958 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Right.

00:21:21.777 --> 00:21:23.946 position:5% line:71% align:start
Well, it's not like
we didn't know.

00:21:24.046 --> 00:21:26.181 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Ryou] Kyou...
[Kyou] Hm?

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.150 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kyou, I...

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.319 position:5% line:77% align:start
I-I'm sorry.

00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:34.456 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thank you, for everything.

00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:38.995 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I...

00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:51.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:21:51.876 --> 00:21:53.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou & Ryou sobbing]

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:54.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] I'm sorry.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on the
revival of the club, Nagisa.

00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:48.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
I made plenty of food so we
could all celebrate together.

00:23:49.771 --> 00:23:52.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much for
your help, everyone.

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:56.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't have done it without
each and every one of you.

00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:58.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] So it's just been
you and your dad living

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
together since you were
really young, you said?

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] We're like strangers.

00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:05.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
We stopped being
family ages ago.

00:24:05.554 --> 00:24:07.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
He still keeps a
smile on his face...

00:24:07.624 --> 00:24:10.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I know he's all
alone in the world.
