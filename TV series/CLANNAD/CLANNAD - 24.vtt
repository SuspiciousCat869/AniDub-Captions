[Tomoyo] Tomoya, wake up.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya groans] My stomach
hurts. I'm staying home.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You've already used
that excuse twice this week.

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:17.349 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You don't have
to come over every morning,
I keep telling you that.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I can't just
ignore the problem.

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:21.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm your girlfriend.
This is my job.

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:23.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's break up.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's not funny. Don't
even joke about that, okay?

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if you're kidding,
it still makes me sad.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
C'mon, don't give me that face.
I take it back.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.338 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, today's the
day of the student
council elections, right?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is no time to be down.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll give it my best.

00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:19.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Students chatting]

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:21.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] The results
be out soon.

00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:23.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't you be back
in your classroom?

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:26.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe, but I feel
calmer here with you.

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] It's been a month</i>
 <i>since I started dating Tomoyo.</i>

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:36.027 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>It wasn't really</i>
 <i>planned or anything.</i>
 <i>It just sort of happened.</i>

00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:38.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>When I first met her,</i>
 <i>I was always cutting class.</i>

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:41.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Even when I did come to school,</i>
 <i>I was late.</i>

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But somehow, after getting</i>
 <i>to know her better...</i>

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>not only did I start coming</i>

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:49.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I started falling in</i>

[Announcement chimes]
[Tomoya gasp]

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:54.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl on P.A.] Attention.
The results of the student

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:56.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
council election have
now been calculated.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
The new student body president
is... Tomoyo Sakagami,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.922 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl] winning with 533 votes.
[Tomoya] Wow! You did it,
Tomoyo!

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:04.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't have done
it without your support.

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, this is where
the real fight begins.

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:10.330 position:5% line:77% align:start
Getting elected is just the
first step in protecting
the cherry trees.

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:12.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, I know.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, you'll stay with me
from now on too, won't you?

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.008 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't have it any other way.

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:34.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on
winning the election!

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi, Sakagami! I'm so glad
you're the new president.

00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:38.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks. That means a lot.

00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:41.130 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl 1] We knew you could
do it! We'll always be
cheering for you!

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
The three of us make a
pretty weird combination,

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:44.768 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] don't you think?
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:47.671 position:5% line:77% align:start
Two senior slackers and
the president of the
student council?

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like we're not even
living in the same world.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those two are the biggest
punks in the school.

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are they doing hanging
around with Sakagami?

00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:58.448 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have no idea. But she seems
to be on good terms with
them, at least.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah... But she's
the president now.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
You really think she'll show?

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:04.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course she's gonna show.

00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:06.289 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's come every other day,
hasn't she?

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pretty laid-back, aren't you?

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:10.026 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Why's that?
[Youhei] Just think for a sec.

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's the student council
president now.

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:15.566 position:5% line:77% align:start
She's gonna be way more
demanding of you than
she was before.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
No running in the hallways.

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eat three meals with
lots of veggies,

00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
and don't leave the
faucets running...

00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:22.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
No way! I'm not ready
to grow up yet!

00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:24.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Hey, what's
with all the yelling?

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo! I'll show
you who's boss!

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:29.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna eat all my vegetables,
just you wait!

00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:31.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
I never know what's
going on in his head.

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:32.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nothing.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess you're right, huh?

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:35.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't agree with him!

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I just came
by to drop these off.

00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:40.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have a council meeting today,
so I'd better split.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.762 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] See ya.
[Tomoya] Bye.

00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:44.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look at that. Busy already.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Guess so.
[Youhei] Hm?

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's nice. She made
lunch for me too.

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:53.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hehehe, now, let's try to
figure out which one is which.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
Too obvious!

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.744 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl 1] What kind of
relationship does he
have with Sakagami?

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure, but they seem
pretty close. Don't you think?

00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:02.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl 1] Don't tell
me they're going out?

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:04.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girl 2] Ah, no way! Hey, shh!

00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:06.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
What're you punks looking at?!

00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:13.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's late. What's her deal?

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:16.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's no surprise, since she
was busy at lunch, too.

00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:18.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh well, I'll wait a
little bit longer.

00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:19.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei grumbles softly]
[Announcements chime]

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:23.337 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo over P.A.] Um, Tomoya...
I'm sorry, but go on
home without me.

00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:27.909 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] It's Tomoyo!
[Tomoyo] I forgot that I have
a School Festival meeting today.

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] We're running behind,
so it'll probably be late in

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:33.782 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoyo] the evening when
I get out. Anyway...
[Girl] Sakagami, the intercom
isn't for personal use!

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:35.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] Turn it off!
[Tomoya] Uh...

00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:37.920 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]
[Youhei laughs] That girl's
a real catch, Tomoya.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's got balls of steel.

00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:42.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Head Teacher] I hope it's not
true, but some students are

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
saying that you ran for
this position on a whim.

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:48.196 position:5% line:77% align:start
I took a look at your
records from the previous
school you attended.

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:52.702 position:5% line:77% align:start
I hate to say it Sakagami,
but it seems like you were
quite the troublemaker.

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.236 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's all in the past now.

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:56.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perhaps so. But that doesn't
change the fact that Sakagami

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
has caused a fair share of
controversy at this school too.

00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:03.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, don't misunderstand me.

00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:04.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not trying to
tell you what to do.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.818 position:5% line:77% align:start
However, considering that
you are our student
council president,

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:10.988 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should be both aware
and watchful of the situation.

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Yes, sir.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.325 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] It's okay, I don't
blame him for being concerned.

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:17.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know people are
gossiping about us.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.698 position:5% line:77% align:start
And I had a feeling my old
school record would catch
up to me eventually.

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:24.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the point is to focus
on the future, not the past.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Right, Tomoya?
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah... yeah of course.

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:33.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right...

00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Students chatting]

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] The School
Festival, huh?

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:45.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
I completely forgot
that was coming up.

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo said she'll be hard
pressed for time till it's over.

00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:50.596 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Let's find
something fun to do.
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:53.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Take a break from
school. We could use one.

00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:55.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll find some place to
hang out on the way home.

00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:57.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have time now, right?

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:37.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon, don't give me that face.

00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:38.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
Once the school festival
is out of the way,

00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:41.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo will have plenty
of time to spend with us.

00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:43.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just us three,
no student council.

00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:45.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you ask me,
I'd be a lot happier

00:07:47.255 --> 00:07:49.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
if I never had to
see her face again.

00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:52.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, let's try talking
to those girls over there.

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:55.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
C'mon, look. The one with
the pony-tail's cute.

00:07:55.564 --> 00:07:57.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you listening to me?!

00:07:57.265 --> 00:07:59.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? He's gone...

00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo sighs]
[Tomoya] Must be hot in there.

00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:04.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah... But...if they
find out where I am,

00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:06.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
then they'll drag me back
to the council room.

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you guys really that busy?

00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:11.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm in the middle of
a campus patrol even now.

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't stretch yourself
too thin, alright?

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:15.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, don't worry, I'll be fine.

00:08:15.152 --> 00:08:18.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, the reason I came here
was to spend some time with you.

00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:23.327 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've been so busy with the
festival that I've hardly had
the chance to see you at all.

00:08:27.498 --> 00:08:29.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
And once the school
festival is finally over,

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.772 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll probably end up spending
all my time trying to preserve
the cherry trees.

00:08:33.872 --> 00:08:37.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then thing might get even
worse than they are now.

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:39.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why...

00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:45.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hiro] Sakagami!
[Tomoyo gasp]

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've been looking for you.

00:08:48.954 --> 00:08:51.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
The chairs of the alumni groups
are waiting in the council room.

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:54.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please hurry back.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.129 position:5% line:77% align:start
Can't you wait until I've
finished my ice cream
cone at least?

00:08:57.229 --> 00:08:58.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll only be a second.

00:08:58.597 --> 00:09:01.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've made them wait for
thirty minutes already.

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:02.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we want to preserve
the cherry trees,

00:09:02.635 --> 00:09:05.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
we won't be able to do it
without their support.

00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:07.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can't afford to upset them.

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:11.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
I understand. I'm sorry.

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:13.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's okay, go give 'em hell.

00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:16.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do my best.

00:09:22.355 --> 00:09:24.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're Tomoya Okazaki,
aren't you?

00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:26.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
Watch how you talk to your
upperclassman, kid.

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:30.298 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe you don't realize it,
but you've grown rather
famous lately.

00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:32.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why's that? Because I'm
a good-for-nothing punk?

00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:35.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, because you're Tomoyo
Sakagami's boyfriend.

00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:37.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:40.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should stop
hanging around her.

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:42.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I get it.
You're jealous, huh?

00:09:42.443 --> 00:09:45.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hiro laughs] Not at all.
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:09:45.214 --> 00:09:47.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hiro] I suppose you could
call it a "special interest".

00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:51.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be blunt... I think she's
someone who can go far in life.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:52.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hm?!

00:09:52.554 --> 00:09:55.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's earnest and hard
working... smart, too.

00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:57.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's someone with a
tremendous amount of promise.

00:09:57.893 --> 00:10:00.629 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why she needs
to set her sights high.

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:03.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
The point is, you're
holding her back.

00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:05.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone knows it's true.

00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:06.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
You little punk!

00:10:06.768 --> 00:10:07.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
You tryin' to pick a fight?!

00:10:07.937 --> 00:10:09.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know it.

00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know it too, don't you?

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:15.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't help her. You can only
hold her back and hurt her.

00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:20.917 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm leaving now. I have to
help Sakagami with the
alumni meeting.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Warning alarm dings]

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:38.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Head Teacher] Sakagami is very
gifted. She's popular as well.

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:41.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
And yet, she's friends with
you, her total opposite,

00:10:41.605 --> 00:10:45.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
who frequently cuts classes
and rarely comes in on time.

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:49.848 position:5% line:77% align:start
And then, to make matters
worse, she used the school
intercom to contact you,

00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:54.387 position:5% line:77% align:start
and abandoned her duties
as council president,
just to meet with you.

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you understand
the situation now?

00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:58.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
Might be hard to admit,
but the problems she's

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
caused are all related
to you, Okazaki.

00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:05.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Tomoya!
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but something
just came up.

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:11.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you go on ahead?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is it really going
to take that long?

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure, but probably.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, I understand.

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks, I appreciate it!

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:26.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hiro] All of this is
your fault, you know.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Hiro] You know what's going on.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.393 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Hiro] How Sakagami has made
it her mission to preserve
the cherry trees.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:34.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know. What about it?

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:38.732 position:5% line:77% align:start
One of the alumni we enlisted
for help heard some nasty
rumors about her.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
Supposedly, one of the students
here caught Sakagami leaving her

00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:44.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
boyfriend's house early in
the morning before school.

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:47.942 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? What does that matter?
She just comes by to wake me up.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:49.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this is you
we're talking about.

00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
People won't believe that.

00:11:51.447 --> 00:11:54.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nasty rumors are
bound to crop up.

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sakagami is the Student
Council president.

00:11:56.818 --> 00:11:59.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
She should serve as an example
to the other students.

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:01.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
If someone like that is
the subject of controversy,

00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:04.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's going to be detrimental
to our cause.

00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:07.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
You understand the situation,
don't you?

00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:11.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
You realize what kind
of person she is...

00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:13.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
and what kind of person YOU are.

00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:15.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Warning alarm dings]

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:23.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
It wasn't much of an
emergency after all.

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:27.217 position:5% line:77% align:start
All it took was a little
meeting to clear up the
misunderstanding.

00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:29.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, it's all over now. Okay?

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:38.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah... Stop spacing out,
you're making a mess.

00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:42.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo...
[Tomoyo] Huh?

00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:43.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's break up.

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:52.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I just think it would
be better that way, all right?

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:56.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told you, don't even joke
about something like that.

00:12:57.082 --> 00:12:59.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have goals
you need to reach.

00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:03.188 position:5% line:77% align:start
Things you may not be able to
accomplish if you have me
holding you back.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay? So just-

00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:12.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
No...

00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:13.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can't!

00:13:14.067 --> 00:13:15.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo...
[Tomoyo] No way!

00:13:15.468 --> 00:13:16.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Woman 1] Hear that?

00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:18.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Woman 2] No, don't look,
it's embarrassing!

00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:19.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] If you...

00:13:19.439 --> 00:13:20.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you don't have me,

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
what are you going
to do with yourself?

00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:26.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm not around... who's gonna
wake you up in the morning?

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:29.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who's gonna make
your lunch every day?

00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:32.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if you have to study
for a test, then what?

00:13:32.553 --> 00:13:34.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
And when... when you...

00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:35.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'll be fine.

00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:39.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll manage, okay? I'm sure
I can do fine on my own.

00:13:39.293 --> 00:13:41.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you... you...

00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:43.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you stay, then
before I know it,

00:13:43.163 --> 00:13:45.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be dependent on
you for everything.

00:13:45.732 --> 00:13:47.101 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not good for anyone.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'm still in
love with you, Tomoya.

00:13:50.338 --> 00:13:51.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't lose you.

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:53.041 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo...

00:13:55.176 --> 00:13:58.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
What I felt for you...
wasn't love, all right?

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:03.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was... being selfish,
that's all.

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:08.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just forget about me
and live your dreams.

00:14:08.357 --> 00:14:11.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just proud that I was able
to spend time with an amazing

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
person like you.
Let's leave it at that.

00:14:14.463 --> 00:14:16.932 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please... Tomoyo.

00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:24.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] I understand.

00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:27.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do my best.

00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:30.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you...

00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:34.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
for going out...
with a girl like me.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was happy.

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:41.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take care.

00:15:24.504 --> 00:15:29.108 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hmmm... And here I thought you
two were gonna get married
after high school.

00:15:29.209 --> 00:15:31.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure'd be nice if
life was that simple.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
But man, I always thought,
if she had to choose,

00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:38.117 position:5% line:77% align:start
she'd at least have the
sense to pick you over
the Student Council.

00:15:38.218 --> 00:15:40.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who knows?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.223 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, now that you don't
have Tomoyo to hound
you all the time,

00:15:43.324 --> 00:15:46.293 position:5% line:77% align:start
does that mean you're
gonna go back to your
old delinquent ways?

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya grumbles and groans]

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:04.912 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Teacher] All right.
So the next problem...
is just like example one.

00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:38.214 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl] Did you hear?
Tomoyo placed fourth
in the national exams.

00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:41.117 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Boy] Yeah, and she
got an award for her
volunteer work, too.

00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:44.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] She might become a
foreign exchange student, too!

00:16:47.857 --> 00:16:49.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm really gonna watch it, okay?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Do whatever you want.

00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:57.000 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Fine. I just thought
you might not want to see it,
that's all.

00:16:58.802 --> 00:17:00.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:17:00.605 --> 00:17:02.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said it's fine.

00:17:02.973 --> 00:17:05.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Alright.

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:08.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the sake of our memories,
we must protect these trees.

00:17:09.047 --> 00:17:11.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only the memories of past
generations, but the memories

00:17:11.616 --> 00:17:13.418 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] that will be formed
by generations to come.
[Youhei] Huh? Where is she?

00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:15.420 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Some international
conference about the
cherry trees.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.256 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] We can't become so
wrapped up in our concept
of "progress"

00:17:18.356 --> 00:17:21.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
that we destroy what
made us who we are.

00:17:21.293 --> 00:17:23.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Must be the same presentation
as the video.

00:17:23.595 --> 00:17:26.298 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah...
[Youhei] Kinda hard to
believe that we used to be

00:17:26.398 --> 00:17:28.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
friends with such an
incredible girl, huh?

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:36.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Hey...
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:43.015 position:5% line:89% align:start
Busy as usual.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.983 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:17:56.497 --> 00:17:59.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya laughs]
What's with your hair?!

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.038 position:5% line:77% align:start
Stop laughing! I have a tough
enough time just looking at
myself in the mirror!

00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:05.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
But what was I supposed to do?

00:18:05.773 --> 00:18:10.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not like I could show up at
a job interview with blond hair.

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:14.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmm.... I guess you
didn't fit their needs.

00:18:14.315 --> 00:18:16.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
But don't give up. I'm
sure you'll find something.

00:18:17.017 --> 00:18:20.555 position:5% line:77% align:start
There are plenty of
satisfying jobs out
there for you, I promise.

00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:28.663 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] The job</i>
 <i>I finally found...</i>

00:18:28.765 --> 00:18:30.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>ended up being in this town.</i>

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:32.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It was a bit of a</i>
 <i>disappointment.</i>

00:18:32.635 --> 00:18:35.638 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I was hoping to be at</i>
 <i>least one train stop away.</i>

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.513 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Principal] Most of you
are going on to college,

00:18:43.613 --> 00:18:47.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
and eventually, you'll become
an important part of society,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.621 position:5% line:77% align:start
with a career of your own.
With that in mind...
[Principal trails off]

00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:53.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Seriously?

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:54.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean you're leaving already?

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
The celebrations
aren't over yet.

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:57.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, but
I'm not interested.

00:18:58.027 --> 00:18:59.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll stop by your place later.

00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:01.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:23.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] How have you been?

00:19:24.022 --> 00:19:25.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:27.693 --> 00:19:28.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:30.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I've been
waiting for you.

00:19:30.228 --> 00:19:31.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to tell you something.

00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:35.935 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] What?
[Tomoyo] These cherry trees
won't be cut down after all.

00:19:36.034 --> 00:19:38.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] It was finally settled.

00:19:38.204 --> 00:19:40.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I see.
[Tomoyo] It was a long fight...

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:43.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] but it was something
I couldn't give up on.

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:45.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, it's finally happened.

00:19:45.544 --> 00:19:48.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
You made your dream
come true, huh?

00:19:48.247 --> 00:19:50.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But I lost something
important along the way.

00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:54.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
Months I wanted to spend
with the person I love.

00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:56.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
Time I can never have back.

00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:01.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
I still love you, Tomoya.

00:20:01.228 --> 00:20:03.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really do. In all this time,

00:20:03.363 --> 00:20:05.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've only grown
to love you more.

00:20:05.365 --> 00:20:08.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
How can you say that when we
haven't spoken in so long?

00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:12.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Maybe not, but I've
watched you all this time.

00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:14.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've still been here with you.

00:20:15.075 --> 00:20:18.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even without my help...
you managed just fine.

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:20.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
You always went to
class on time...

00:20:20.481 --> 00:20:23.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
you worked hard every day
and you never gave up.

00:20:25.052 --> 00:20:26.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:20:26.587 --> 00:20:29.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although my lunches
weren't as good as yours.

00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:33.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
It certainly wasn't easy...
but I looked for a job, too.

00:20:33.261 --> 00:20:35.096 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, thanks to
my school record,

00:20:35.197 --> 00:20:37.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
a lot of doors were closed
to me, but in the end,

00:20:37.132 --> 00:20:39.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
I finally landed a position.

00:20:39.401 --> 00:20:42.939 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's at a recycling plant.
A normal office job.

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:46.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well... and the place is
pretty close to here.

00:20:46.408 --> 00:20:50.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's still inside town actually,
so there's no commute.

00:20:55.318 --> 00:20:56.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's it, I guess.

00:20:57.787 --> 00:21:01.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey... what kind of things
did we use to talk about?

00:21:02.893 --> 00:21:04.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
What did I say?

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:05.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
How did I laugh?

00:21:06.462 --> 00:21:07.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't seem to remember.

00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:09.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Warning alarm dings]

00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:11.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We're on two
separate paths now.

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:13.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll graduate next year...

00:21:13.704 --> 00:21:16.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
then you'll leave this
town and go far away.

00:21:18.108 --> 00:21:20.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have the strength
to do that.

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:22.413 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I'm different.

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:25.249 position:5% line:83% align:start
All I can do is stay
here in this town.

00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:27.586 position:5% line:89% align:start
In the same place, until I die.

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's the kind of person I am.

00:21:32.189 --> 00:21:33.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] If you
can't go anywhere,

00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
then I'll come to you.

00:21:36.227 --> 00:21:37.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll stay with you.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.800 position:5% line:89% align:start
Buy why?

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to stay trapped
in a miserable place like this!

00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:46.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go to a good college,
meet wonderful people!

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
Set your dreams high
and make them come true!

00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:51.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can aim higher than
this Tomoyo, much higher!

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:54.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't waste your time
staying grounded with me!

00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:56.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Don't say any more.

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:58.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to hear it,
all right?

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:01.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've already decided.

00:22:01.454 --> 00:22:03.289 position:5% line:83% align:start
Getting good grades and
listening to teachers

00:22:03.389 --> 00:22:06.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
can take me somewhere
high and far away...

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:09.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
but what if that's not
where I want to go?

00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:13.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right here, by your side,
Tomoya...

00:22:13.233 --> 00:22:15.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
is the only place I wanna be.

00:22:36.324 --> 00:22:38.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who's the upperclassman here?

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll come.

00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:44.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a bit late
to say this but...

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'll follow,
wherever you go.

00:22:56.112 --> 00:22:57.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:22:58.014 --> 00:22:59.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo sobbing]
Tomoya!

00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:03.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, come on.

00:23:03.153 --> 00:23:04.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's no big deal, right?

00:23:13.797 --> 00:23:15.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on...

00:23:15.298 --> 00:23:17.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't have to cry.

00:23:18.035 --> 00:23:19.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's okay...
