Kind: captions

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:05.596 position:5% line:77% align:start
And that's exactly why
I was relieved to see
the two of you...

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:07.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your shining faces.

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:11.134 position:5% line:89% align:start
The two of us?

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] She's right here.</i>

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:15.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>You can talk to her.</i>

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Talk about the feelings</i>
 <i>you've held in for two years.</i>

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong? Is
something the matter?

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa? Okazaki?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.281 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Is this possible?</i>

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.430 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kouko] Have you
heard this rumor?
[Tomoya] What rumor?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] That Fuko is
here at this school.

00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:09.034 position:5% line:83% align:start
That she's healthy and running
around with her friends.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Miss Ibuki!

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:16.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Of course,
I know that's not possible.

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:19.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just not possible.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:24.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, I see her sleeping
figure every day...

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:25.716 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the hospital.

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:27.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if only in her dreams,

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad if she's surrounded
by lots of friends.

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:34.524 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good friends. Close friends.

00:02:34.624 --> 00:02:35.691 position:5% line:89% align:start
If she can only dream,

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:39.194 position:5% line:83% align:start
then I just hope she is
always with her friends.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:42.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
If she were ever to wake up
and then come back to school,

00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:47.368 position:5% line:77% align:start
will the two of you make a
solemn vow to me that you
will be her very best friend?

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa sobs quietly]
Of course we will.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sure your sister would
be one of the most adorable
girls in school.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
We tried, but we just
couldn't leave her alone.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's so fun to be with.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even just that would
be a great comfort...

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
because she wasn't very sociable
and had very few close friends.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
So please, keep her company,

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:09.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
until the end of her dream.

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:14.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kouko, if I may, although
it's not my place to say so,

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:17.226 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] but you should
marry your fiance.
[Kouko] Huh?

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm sure that's
what your sister wants.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.063 position:5% line:89% align:start
She only wants you to be happy.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:25.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I think so too, Miss Ibuki.

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:29.437 position:5% line:77% align:start
If she knew you
were reconsidering your
engagement just because of her,

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:32.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know that she would
be very sad inside.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
For your little sister's sake
as well, please marry him.

00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:38.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes, she would
think that your happiness

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:41.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
is her happiness!
I just know she would.

00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:48.186 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't explain it,
but I feel like your
words have a strange power.

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:51.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like that child
really thinks that.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.793 position:5% line:77% align:start
Up until just now, I have
to confess, I wasn't able
to think that way.

00:03:55.893 --> 00:03:59.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
Leaving Fuko all alone in a coma
and becoming happy myself...

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:02.932 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Pardon me for saying
so, but thinking that way
is quite selfish.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:06.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say, you could very
well be right about that.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
But still, I do
want to be happy.

00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:18.512 position:5% line:77% align:start
I just know... Kouko,
I know your sister will
awaken one day, won't she?

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:20.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope so.

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really do hope so.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:29.121 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Botan] Bui, bui!
[Fuko] So you like it?
You like it?

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Botan] Bui!
[Fuko] If you would to,

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:34.627 position:5% line:77% align:start
I would very much like
you to come to my sister's
upcoming wedding.

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:36.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Botan] Bui!
[Fuko] So you say you'll come?

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Thank you very much!
[Botan] Bui, bui, bui! Bui!

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.868 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] I didn't know...
that my sister was hesitating
to get married.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.836 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] But it's a good thing,</i>
 <i>Kouko's finally decided.</i>
[Fuko] Excuse me. Here you go.

00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:48.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Nagisa] Yes, thanks to you.</i>
[Fuko] Please take this.

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:51.774 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>[Nagisa] I'll work harder</i>
 <i>and increase the number</i>
[Fuko] My sister's getting
married to her sweetheart

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:54.644 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>[Nagisa] of people attending.</i>
 <i>I know I can, I can help her!</i>
[Fuko] and I would just love it
if you'd come to the wedding!

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:58.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Yeah, let's pass out</i>
 <i>starfish throughout the school.</i>

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's such a strong person.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] What I did
was hurtful to Fuko.

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.221 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] It's not your
fault at all, Nagisa.
[Nagisa sobs]

00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:09.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
If anyone, I'm the one
who should be blamed.

00:05:09.456 --> 00:05:12.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just couldn't believe
that it was all true.

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:15.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wanted her to meet Kouko
and verify her existence.

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:23.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, you were the
one who was right, not me.

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.804 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Here!

00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:27.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Dude] Uuuh...

00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:32.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Please accept this.

00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:35.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aaaah... well....

00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:41.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fu-chan is working even
harder than before.

00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:42.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
If only she would
come out of her coma,

00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:45.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
it would be a happy
ending for everyone.

00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:52.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
Surely, it will be soon,
then she can attend

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:56.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
Miss Ibuki's wedding and join
her in her very special day.

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:59.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Uh, please accept this!

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] She ignored
her totally.

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:04.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It was like she
didn't even see Fu-chan.

00:06:04.303 --> 00:06:05.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait a minute.
I just remembered,

00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:08.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's one more person
who might accept one.

00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:11.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi, Kotomi, Kotomi!

00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:12.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, notice us!

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:15.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi-chan!

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:19.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:21.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
So that's all it takes
for you to notice us?

00:06:21.617 --> 00:06:23.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is your relationship
with her?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is our relationship.
There's nothing else.

00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:28.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
And who is this?

00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
I came here explicitly
to give this to you.

00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:32.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please accept this gift.

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:38.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is she a bully?

00:06:38.733 --> 00:06:40.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's not harassing you, Kotomi.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
She says she wants to give
you a present, that's all.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] A present for me?
[Fuko] Yes, if you will,

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:50.309 position:5% line:77% align:start
please attend my sister's
upcoming wedding to her
precious fiance.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
A star...

00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:54.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, it's a starfish.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
A starfish?

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:59.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
Starfish: scientific name
is Asterias amurensis.

00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:02.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
An invertebrate. Echinodermata,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.989 position:5% line:89% align:start
or in English, starfish.

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:07.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Other encyclopedia citations
call the creature a sea star.

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:10.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
While appearing docile,
it is actually carnivorous.

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:13.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] That starfish?
[Fuko gasps]

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:17.699 position:5% line:77% align:start
Terrific! This starfish person
is more knowledgable about
starfish than even I am!

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Just as you'd
expect from a genius.

00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:23.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, I'm not very
well versed about animals.

00:07:23.537 --> 00:07:25.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not true, smarty girl!

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would especially like someone
as smart as you to accept one!

00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:30.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
You must, please, come to it!

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.281 position:5% line:89% align:start
A present for me?

00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad she liked my present.

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
You two should get
along really well.

00:07:42.454 --> 00:07:45.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're both kind of dazed
and seem a little awkward.

00:07:45.857 --> 00:07:48.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I am not awkward,
you critical monster meanie!

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:50.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am much more
skillful than you,

00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:51.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
and much smarter than you,
so there!

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:53.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah?! Well you've
done it now! I think

00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:56.800 position:5% line:77% align:start
you and I should go ahead
and compete in a tongue
twisters face off.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
I accept your challenge.

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:01.904 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kris Kringle carefully
crunched on multicolored

00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:05.107 position:5% line:83% align:start
crimson candy canes while
climbing the catacombs. Yes.

00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:07.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
For your information
it was "spelunking".

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who would bite their
words that way?!

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're one pretty crafty
tongue twister player.

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:12.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Crafty?

00:08:13.047 --> 00:08:14.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
It means that you're dishonest.

00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:17.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am not dishonest!
I am very fair!

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:20.653 position:5% line:77% align:start
The neighbors all said
I was one of the fairest
girls on the block!

00:08:20.754 --> 00:08:22.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what kind of
neighborhood is that?

00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:24.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here goes...

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.725 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyokyokyokyakoko!

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kokokokokokokoko!

00:08:28.693 --> 00:08:31.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kokokoko! How 'bout that?

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:34.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't stand there and make a
face like you did it perfectly!

00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:36.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki, you are
a very rude person.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're the one who's rude.

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:40.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi there. You two are
getting along as usual.

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:42.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] We do not
get along at all!

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, we're right in the middle
of a tongue twister fight.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Hmph.

00:08:47.342 --> 00:08:49.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki and you, Sunohara,

00:08:49.544 --> 00:08:51.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
had better not do anything
that will trouble me

00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:53.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
or upset me in the least,

00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:56.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
or else something very bad
will happen to you both.

00:08:56.483 --> 00:08:59.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oooh? Why don't you tell
me what will happen?

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, come on, tell me!

00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko fails at whistling,
instead just blowing air]

00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:14.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Low rumbling]
[Youhei] Huh?

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:19.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
[All] We have to protect Fuko!

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:20.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yells]

00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:26.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
So where did your fans take him?

00:09:26.543 --> 00:09:27.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You gave out a
lot of invitations today.

00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:35.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Yes! I'll make tomorrow's
batch when I go home.

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:39.288 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, Fuko, would you mind
terribly going home
alone again today?

00:09:39.387 --> 00:09:41.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa and I have something
we need to do.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:45.692 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Excuse me...
[Nagisa] Hello, Miss Ibuki!

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Oh, hello.
Welcome to you both.

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:49.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
And what are you here for today?

00:09:50.063 --> 00:09:52.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] There was something
I wanted to ask you.

00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:55.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was wondering, you haven't,
by any chance, changed your mind

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:57.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
about getting married,
have you, Kouko?

00:09:57.937 --> 00:10:01.473 position:5% line:77% align:start
Are you saying that you
were worried about that
and came to verify it?

00:10:01.573 --> 00:10:06.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, don't you worry.
My fiance and I have already
discussed the situation.

00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:09.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:11.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
Except, we can't get a
reservation at a wedding hall.

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:15.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like it will be a while
before we can have a ceremony.

00:10:15.952 --> 00:10:18.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are a lot of happy
people in the world, it seems.

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:20.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
A wedding hall...

00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:21.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, to be honest,

00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:23.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wanted to get married
at the school.

00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:27.062 position:5% line:77% align:start
At the high school
where I taught those
may wonderful students.

00:10:27.162 --> 00:10:28.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean at our school?

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought it would be so
meaningful to be married

00:10:30.932 --> 00:10:34.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
surrounded by my students, and
the teachers, and dear friends.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] With my sister there...
[Nagisa sniffles]

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't start
crying again.
[Nagisa sobs quietly]

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. I'l try to stop.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I could, can I ask you
something about your sister?

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.712 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kouko] Yes?
[Tomoya] I remember...
that you said that Fuko

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:52.083 position:5% line:77% align:start
was a little shy and awkward
around people, and not good at
making friends, didn't you?

00:10:52.183 --> 00:10:55.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
What kind of girl was she,
before the accident?

00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:15.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] That first summer
after I became a teacher,

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:18.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
we went to the beach
with relatives.

00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:22.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
There were other
children Fu-chan's age,

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:26.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
but she all but hid behind me.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:31.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even when people talked to her,
she wasn't able to greet them.

00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:36.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
She sat on the beach playing
with a starfish the whole time.

00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:37.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
All alone.

00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:44.594 position:5% line:77% align:start
I realized for the
first time then, Fu-chan
wouldn't go near anyone.

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:47.630 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Girl 1] We're going the same
way you are. Wanna walk with us?
[Kouko] She graduated junior
high like that.

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:49.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
She doesn't talk
very much, does she?

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:54.603 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kouko] But I knew that she
couldn't go on like that.
[Girl 1] Oh? Well, bye.

00:11:54.703 --> 00:11:56.405 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] As we went
into Spring Break,

00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:59.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
I tried to keep my
distance from her.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.678 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was very difficult,
but I kept up a front
that I was very busy.

00:12:05.446 --> 00:12:08.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think Fu-chan was very lonely.

00:12:08.181 --> 00:12:14.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I hoped that her loneliness
would spur her to make friends
at the new school.

00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:16.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
And on the morning of
the entrance ceremony,

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:19.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
she said that she'd work
on making friends.

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:24.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was a very nice
morning that day.

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:26.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember it so clearly.

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:28.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
The sun shining...
as bright as her smile.

00:12:37.106 --> 00:12:39.242 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] And on the way
home after the ceremony,
[Nagisa sniffles]

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
she had the accident.

00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:42.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
But it seems so strange...

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:44.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you two so
interested in her?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm not mistaken, you two
have never even met my sister.

00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:50.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yet you care so much.

00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:54.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be honest, it may be
because both Furukawa and I,

00:12:54.255 --> 00:12:58.691 position:5% line:77% align:start
we are kinda awkward around
people like your sister is
in some way or another.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.126 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa sobs quietly]

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:05.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Here you go.
Please accept this present.

00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:09.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] It's only until</i>
 <i>Fuko opens her eyes.</i>

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:12.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>When she's discharged</i>
 <i>and returns to school,</i>

00:13:12.603 --> 00:13:15.605 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Kouko will realize</i>
 <i>that she has lots of friends.</i>
[Fuko] Please accept this, sir!

00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:18.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] She's not</i>
 <i>shy or awkward at all.</i>

00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:19.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Nagisa] Yes...</i>

00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:24.613 position:5% line:77% align:start
It is true that more and more
people are accepting our
starfish gift.

00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:27.850 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's because everyone believes
Fuko has been discharged
from the hospital.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
And the rumors about
a ghost are gone.

00:13:29.784 --> 00:13:32.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
A discharge? What are
you talking about?

00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:35.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
You lost the match, remember?
What are you even doing here?

00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:37.658 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop being so rigid.

00:13:37.758 --> 00:13:39.960 position:5% line:83% align:start
I only wanted to spend time
with my lovely Nagisa.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh! Uh,
thank you very much.

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I think you will meet
some nice girl who'll be

00:13:44.797 --> 00:13:47.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
a little more suited to
your personality, Sunohara.

00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:49.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been rejected
in an instant!

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are still a lot of
students of all ages in

00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:53.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
this school who ignore Fuko.
So I was thinking, we might want

00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:56.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
wanna consider handing out some
other kind of present to them.

00:13:56.775 --> 00:13:58.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't think
that's necessary.

00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:01.779 position:5% line:77% align:start
Every one of the kids
who accepted them were
glad to have them.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:04.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, they're just saying they're
happy. No one in this school

00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:06.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
would be happy getting
something like a shuriken.

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:08.952 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Shuriken?
[Youhei] This thing
is a shuriken.

00:14:09.052 --> 00:14:11.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] It is, isn't it?
[Fuko] This is a starfish!

00:14:11.287 --> 00:14:14.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
Starfish?! I thought it was
a shuriken all this time.

00:14:14.357 --> 00:14:18.360 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really, Okazaki and Sunohara,
you are both so rude.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it's true that most of
the people who accepted the

00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:23.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
invitations don't know
that it's a starfish.

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:25.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not necessary
to tell them, is it?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know that someday very soon,
I'd like to tell all of those

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:32.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
who look like they'd appreciate
it, that it's a starfish.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, it's a starfish.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:36.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's out and out harassment,
if you ask me.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:40.745 position:5% line:77% align:start
And then, after I've given
one to everyone in the
whole student body,

00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll make a public announcement.

00:14:42.914 --> 00:14:45.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko, over speaker]
Actually, it's a starfish!

00:14:46.084 --> 00:14:49.254 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'd love to see the whole
student body fall flat
on their faces, but...

00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:51.589 position:5% line:83% align:start
They won't fall flat.
They'll have a festival!

00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:55.359 position:5% line:77% align:start
It'll become a school
event just like the
Founder's Festival.

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:56.759 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll be so much fun!

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:59.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Students cheering]
[Boy] ALRIGHT!

00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:01.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
I could go to my grave
without seeing that.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
We should probably distribute
something cuter than that.

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Then, what about-
[Tomoya] Rejected!

00:15:06.968 --> 00:15:08.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I haven't said anything yet.

00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:10.205 position:5% line:89% align:start
Believe me, you don't have to.

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:12.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're gonna bring up
the Big Dango Family.

00:15:12.173 --> 00:15:14.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes, but I...
[Youhei] Hey!

00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:16.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't just brush off Nagisa's
ideas like they were nothing!

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:19.746 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Then, tell me.
Do you think the Big
Dango Family is cute?

00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:21.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are they as adorable
as all get out?

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, there must be
situations sometimes

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
where someone could call
them cute and adorable.

00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:30.589 position:5% line:77% align:start
Not sometimes, the Big Dango
Family is always cute,
don't you know?

00:15:30.688 --> 00:15:32.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
Excuse me. I'm very
sorry, Nagisa,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.528 position:5% line:77% align:start
but I think starfish are cuter
than the Big Dango Family
any day of the week.

00:15:37.628 --> 00:15:40.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, so an outbreak of
war between starfish and dango?

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course starfish are cute,
but the Big Dango Family is

00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:46.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
a heck of a lot cuter,
and everyone knows it!

00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:48.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
I get the appeal of
the Big Dango Family,

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I don't care! I want to
give out starfish to everyone.

00:15:51.806 --> 00:15:53.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've never seen Nagisa
so passionate.

00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:55.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
They'll never give
in on this one.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
Starfish don't
have a theme song.

00:15:57.512 --> 00:16:00.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
The dangos have a really
cute theme song they sing.

00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:02.115 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I'm gonna sing it!

00:16:02.883 --> 00:16:08.821 position:5% line:89% align:start
♪Dango, dango, dango, dango.

00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:11.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dango, dango family.♪

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:14.159 position:5% line:83% align:start
Starfish can do as
much as they can!

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:18.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to sing!
♪Starfish, starfish...

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:19.797 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's plagiarism!

00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:21.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
So how long you think this
confrontation will last?

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
How would I know? At this point,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
no one will ever be
able to stop them.

00:16:25.102 --> 00:16:28.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, then, starfish and
dango are both number one.

00:16:28.572 --> 00:16:30.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Yeah!
[Boys both yell]

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:32.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Huh?
[Tomoya] Let's just cool off

00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:34.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
and start the whole
thing from the beginning.

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:35.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all that, I still
want to stay with the

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
idea of giving starfish.
If we change now,

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:40.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like we'll lose
the momentum we've gained.

00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:43.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
What eactly are you two
fighting with anyway?

00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:49.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well... Look at how cute
these little buggers are.

00:16:49.624 --> 00:16:54.027 position:5% line:77% align:start
Again. Sunohara, can you do
me a favor and just your
face down on this table?

00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:55.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] On the table?
[Tomoya] Please, man?

00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:58.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
Believe me, your handsome face
is the only way to help her.

00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:01.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, okay, if you
put it that way.

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:02.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] How easy to manipulate.

00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:04.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki,
what are you...

00:17:06.304 --> 00:17:09.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess that while I was poking
the starfish, I got too relaxed.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's okay, poke
around all you like.

00:17:12.142 --> 00:17:15.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to tell me,
I'll poke away!

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:17.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei makes pained sounds]

00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:23.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko yells]

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, that looks
painful. Very painful.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Furukawa, come with me.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're going to see Koumura.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.070 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Koumura] I must say,
it's quite unusual for
you to ask me for help.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
You do remember Ibuki, the art
teacher who use to work here?

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:51.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Komura] Ibuki?

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember well.

00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:57.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
An uncommonly hairy-chested
guy...

00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:58.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, no, no! Not that guy!

00:17:59.082 --> 00:18:02.452 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kouko Ibuki, the popular
art teacher who quit
three years ago!

00:18:02.552 --> 00:18:04.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right.

00:18:04.187 --> 00:18:07.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
Recently, I fear I'm finding
I'm getting so forgetful.

00:18:07.956 --> 00:18:10.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's supposed to be getting
married really soon.

00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:13.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, congratulations!

00:18:13.429 --> 00:18:15.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not to me, Komura.

00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:17.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please don't use such
ambiguous speech.

00:18:18.032 --> 00:18:21.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not ambiguous speech
by any stretch! Good grief,

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:24.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
where does the seriousness
begin with you, pops?

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:31.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, if I understand correctly,
your request is to allow them

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
to have their wedding here
at school? Is that right?

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Wait a minute,
how did you know about that?

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:39.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, yes, Miss Ibuki might
have mentioned it to me

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:42.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
once or twice while she
was teaching here with me.

00:18:42.487 --> 00:18:45.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were very close friends, so
we used to chat a great deal.

00:18:46.023 --> 00:18:48.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
What exactly is the
forgetful part?

00:18:48.325 --> 00:18:51.627 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, wow about it?
Can you please allow us
to have the wedding here?

00:18:51.728 --> 00:18:54.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll try talking to the
principal about the matter.

00:18:55.063 --> 00:18:57.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want you
to worry about it.

00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:59.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
All our teachers and
administrative staff

00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:03.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
here were always so
very fond of Miss Ibuki.

00:19:04.872 --> 00:19:06.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have our wedding at the school?

00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:10.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, Mr. Koumura is going to
arrange everything for us.

00:19:10.778 --> 00:19:13.246 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You don't have
to wait months for an
opening at a wedding hall.

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:15.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You can get
married right away.

00:19:15.248 --> 00:19:16.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you both very much.

00:19:16.882 --> 00:19:19.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's just so sweet of
you to arrange it.

00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:23.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I have bad news.

00:19:23.888 --> 00:19:26.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid Fuko's condition
has gotten worse.

00:19:27.024 --> 00:19:28.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:44.239 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Kouko] The other day,</i>
 <i>the doctor told me she</i>
 <i>probably won't awaken again.</i>

00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:49.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I... still believe Fu-chan
will open her eyes someday.

00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:58.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa beings crying]

00:19:58.117 --> 00:20:03.356 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Kouko] But I don't know</i>
 <i>if it will be next week</i>
 <i>or ten years from now.</i>

00:20:03.456 --> 00:20:08.260 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>After I get married,</i>
 <i>I plan to move to the</i>
 <i>next town near her hospital.</i>

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Then, I'll be able</i>
 <i>to be with her longer.</i>

00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:14.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>And maybe be there...</i>

00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:16.966 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>when she opens those eyes.</i>

00:20:21.237 --> 00:20:22.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] I wonder if Fuko knew?</i>

00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:25.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>That's why she did the</i>
 <i>only thing she could...</i>

00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:27.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Increase the number</i>
 <i>of guests at the wedding.</i>

00:20:27.544 --> 00:20:30.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Hey! You
look really depressed.

00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:31.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did something happen
to you today?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Happened to me?"
What about you?

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
You seem pretty out of it too.

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:40.621 position:5% line:77% align:start
I gotta tell ya, after
you left with Nagisa,
a strange thing happened.

00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:42.556 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Please accept this.

00:20:42.657 --> 00:20:44.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please accept this!

00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:47.360 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you, uh,
please accept this?

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:52.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a minute.

00:20:53.265 --> 00:20:54.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah? What do you want?

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:55.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?

00:20:55.701 --> 00:20:57.001 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't act dumb with me.

00:20:57.101 --> 00:20:59.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
An underclassman just
called out to you guys.

00:20:59.137 --> 00:21:00.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why did you ignore her?

00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:02.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
Underclassman? What are
you talking about?

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:05.242 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Don't give me that!
Just now, a girl called
out to you.

00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:08.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
She handed you a sculpture
and asked you to accept it.

00:21:09.045 --> 00:21:11.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is wrong with you?
Who did what?

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.682 position:5% line:89% align:start
What am I...

00:21:12.782 --> 00:21:14.383 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't see any girl.

00:21:17.787 --> 00:21:19.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
It wasn't some kind of joke.

00:21:19.554 --> 00:21:23.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm serious. These guys
couldn't even see Fuko there.

00:21:23.257 --> 00:21:26.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki... who is
this girl, Fuko?

00:21:26.393 --> 00:21:27.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, Sunohara?

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:29.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I've heard
of Fuko Ibuki.

00:21:29.563 --> 00:21:31.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
On the day of her
entrance ceremony,

00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:32.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
the poor girl had a
terrible accident,

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:35.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
and she's been hospitalized
in a coma ever since.

00:21:35.902 --> 00:21:37.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
But her name is Fuko Isogai.

00:21:37.837 --> 00:21:41.507 position:5% line:77% align:start
I asked all the sophomores
participating in the various
clubs on campus,

00:21:41.607 --> 00:21:44.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
and not a one of them had
ever known a Fuko Isogai.

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:46.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that's not all.

00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:49.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think people
are remembering her.

00:21:49.947 --> 00:21:51.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying she's
being forgotten?

00:21:51.516 --> 00:21:54.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even the people who received
sculptures are forgetting her.

00:21:54.217 --> 00:21:56.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
They don't remember
receiving a sculpture.

00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:59.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's like they never got one.

00:21:59.255 --> 00:22:02.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, what in the
world is happening here?

00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:04.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't they remember Fuko?

00:22:06.394 --> 00:22:09.397 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki! Are you listening?

00:23:44.713 --> 00:23:49.350 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, I'm kinda starting
to feel that you're not such
a bad sort, Okazaki.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you've thought of me as
a bad person up until now?

00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:54.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now, I like you
better than a sea slug.

00:23:54.988 --> 00:23:56.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really? Great!

00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:59.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have absolutely no
idea what level that is.

00:24:00.892 --> 00:24:02.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving.

00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:07.865 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] The forgetting</i>
 <i>starts with those who</i>
 <i>didn't know her well.</i>

00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Welcome home, Fuko.
