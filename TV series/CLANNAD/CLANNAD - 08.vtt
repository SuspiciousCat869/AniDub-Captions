00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki? Okazaki?

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Oh, sorry.
What is it, Furukawa?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.436 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have to say, you've been
acting weird ever since
this morning.

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:19.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
So it appears to me, you've
returned to being a weird
guy once again.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're the only one who
says I'm weird!

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:23.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa giggles]

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:26.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
I forgot to tell you about
Miss Ibuki.

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:31.018 position:5% line:77% align:start
She called me just last night
on my cell and told me that
the wedding will be next Sunday.

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:36.591 position:5% line:77% align:start
Is that so? The Mr. Koumura must
have gotten the approval of the
vice principal.

00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:41.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
Soon all of your hard efforts
will bear good fruit, Fu-chan.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:42.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please accept this!

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:30.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey there, would you please
accept this?

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.281 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's starting to seem to me that
more and more people are not
accepting them.

00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:40.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
And it's not just they're not
accepting them,

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:45.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it's like they somehow don't
notice Fu-chan at all.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.358 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that's not all.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think people are
remembering her.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] It's just his</i>
 <i>imagination.</i>

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You're not with
Sunohara today?

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
He said he was going to cut
class right now.

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:00.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi Tomoyo, it's been
a little while.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:02.206 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute, you're...

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:04.141 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Nagisa Furukawa,

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:06.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
we met at the Founder's
Festival, remember?

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:10.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
When my dear friend Fu-chan
gave you the sculpture.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sculpture?

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, this little thing.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.691 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoyo?

00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:24.495 position:5% line:77% align:start
I remember! That's right,
I received a lovely little
sculpture from her.

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:28.365 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] To forget after
receiving a present was
rude of me.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:32.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey wait just a minute.
But that's so strange...

00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:34.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
How could I forget that
sweet little girl?

00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki?

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:47.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Today, there are a lot
of starfish left.

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't worry about it.
There are days like this.

00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:53.758 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] That's right, we'll
work harder tomorrow to make
up for today.

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:56.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
There she goes again.

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:02.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, you returned to yourself
awfully quickly today.

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:04.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
My body warned me all
of a sudden.

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:07.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
It said "Run away, this
guy's dangerous!"

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
You must be imagining it.

00:04:09.474 --> 00:04:11.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not her imagination.

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:15.748 position:5% line:77% align:start
Remember how you're always
playing such dirty tricks
on her?

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:21.153 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Moving her to a
different place and making her
embrace Sunohara's head.

00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:23.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, it WAS your doing after all!

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the mini-worst thing
I've ever seen!

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what exactly do you mean
by saying "mini-worst"?

00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:31.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
You seem to be hurt when
I say the worst,

00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:32.431 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I made it up for you.

00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if you're called that,
I think it's cute.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.839 position:5% line:77% align:start
It might just be the most
adorable thing ever.
How about it?

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
It doesn't do any good unless
you stop using the word "worst"!

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't change that!

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:47.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
If anything, I'll change
the "mini" part!

00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:51.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fine! Then, change "mini"
to "I am" will ya?

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
I am the worst!

00:04:53.552 --> 00:04:56.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no! Now that makes
me the worst!

00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:57.556 position:5% line:89% align:start
No good?

00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:59.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa giggles]

00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:02.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
You two are on good
terms after all.

00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:05.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mitsui!

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:08.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, from the other day...

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I can't remember who
you two were again.

00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:12.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
[both] Huh?

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean who were we?

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:17.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
You received one from
Fuko too, didn't you?

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:20.447 position:5% line:89% align:start
One that looks like this.

00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:25.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you mean this
little star thing?

00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:27.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mitsui, you accepted
one, remember?

00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you said you'd attend
Fu-chan's sister's wedding.

00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:38.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry, I don't know what
all of this is about.

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:40.101 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko, it's about Fuko!

00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:42.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's right in front of
your eyes.

00:05:44.437 --> 00:05:45.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mitsui] Her?

00:05:45.872 --> 00:05:46.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, not her!

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:49.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can't you see there's
another person there?

00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.214 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's no one over there.

00:05:53.313 --> 00:05:55.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is this some kind of little
joke or something?

00:05:57.185 --> 00:05:58.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:06.060 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan...

00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:08.663 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko!

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, this is so weird.

00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:18.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's being forgotten by
everyone she knows.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:21.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It may be because her
condition has changed.

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:24.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone's losing their
memory of her.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
It may be that her very
existence is beginning to fade.

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:28.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] But that's...

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:34.622 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, Fuko,
don't let it bother you.

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:37.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mitsui was just joking around
with you, that's all.

00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:40.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if wasn't, she must
have misunderstood.

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, she probably just
didn't remember.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:46.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know how the seniors are
so busy with entrance exams.

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:49.805 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you worry about it,
Furukawa and I are with
you all the way.

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:53.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, tomorrow, Sunohara
should be there for you as well.

00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:56.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
And don't forget your legion
of many ardent fans too.

00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, don't lose your
momentum, cheer up a little!

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I promise I'll do my best.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I'm getting better at
this starfish business.

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] The starfish pastries
are quite popular, you know.

00:07:19.902 --> 00:07:22.471 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] We have those who buy
them regularly.
[Akio] Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:23.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you serious?

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:25.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
If no one else thinks so,

00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:26.642 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think they're a great hit.

00:07:26.742 --> 00:07:29.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] I'm so glad! [laughs]

00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:32.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio laughs]

00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.618 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] Then, I'll make a
special starfish pastry
just for you.

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:39.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really you will?
I'm so thrilled!

00:07:40.757 --> 00:07:44.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, you're awfully
quiet today.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes, I was engrossed
in carving the starfish.

00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Customer] Excuse me!

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:54.704 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyone here?

00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:56.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have a customer
in your store.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Don't talk to me,
I'm doing a difficult part.

00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:02.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Customer] Isn't there
someone working?

00:08:04.348 --> 00:08:06.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't you go and see
what she wants?

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:08.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] It's okay, just pretend
that we're out.

00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:14.657 position:5% line:77% align:start
Shame on you! Besides, with all
the noise we're making, there's
no use pretending that.

00:08:14.757 --> 00:08:17.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:19.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something's different
after all...

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
All that griping is getting on
my nerves, you little brat!

00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio screams in pain]

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:26.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear!

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've got the first-aid kit,
my darling!

00:08:27.837 --> 00:08:30.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sanae, it's all over for me...

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
Get a hold of yourself,
my dearest darling!

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:38.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, Mom. I'll take good
care of the bakery.

00:08:38.182 --> 00:08:41.719 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I leave the rest to you,
dear daughter...

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:45.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much for coming.

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:48.759 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] NOOOO! Intense pain!

00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:50.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] More gently please!
[Tomoya] I have to say,

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:52.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm very relieved that your
family is still the same.

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:55.165 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] Akio, I can't treat
the wound if you're moving
so violently.

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I understand!
[Sanae] Fuko, hold him down.

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:01.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
Furukawa...

00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:03.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] [crying] I know,
I'm sorry.

00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:05.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was holding it back, but...

00:09:11.749 --> 00:09:13.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] What's going
to happen now?

00:09:13.817 --> 00:09:17.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
Will everyone just steadily
forget Fu-chan?

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:23.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
It could be that you and
I will too.

00:09:27.098 --> 00:09:29.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no way that would
ever happen.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, the wedding is right
around the corner.

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:35.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
You and I will do our best
to support Fuko and her project.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:42.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes, until her
dream ends.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Misae] I've had it, you guys!

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:02.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well tell me, what did they
all do this time?

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're all so darn picky
about their food.

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:06.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was going to give them
all a piece of my mind.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're not in grade school,
you know.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told you, Misae, you're
too easy on 'em.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.314 position:5% line:77% align:start
If they don't eat what you
serve, do your special move
on them, no questions asked.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, I bet the entire team
will have a change of heart.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:20.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
So is that the way it is with
you guys?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
Misae, here.

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kouko Ibuki, a former teacher
here is getting married.

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:35.000 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's in place of an
invitation. We'd really
like you to come.

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:38.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei laughing]

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:40.574 position:5% line:83% align:start
What were you doing yesterday
and today?

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko was waiting, you know?

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:46.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko-chan?

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:51.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
I skipped a few of my classes
and did some research

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
on the girl named Fuko Ibuki.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why did you do something
like that?

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:01.660 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] The woman getting
married on Sunday is named
Ibuki, isn't she?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, Fuko's last name
is Ibuki after all.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko Isogai is a lie.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Fuko Ibuki is in
the hospital.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, who is this girl with us?

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, do you even know who
this girl really is?

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:17.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
For all we know she could
be faking her identity.

00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:24.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
If she's a fake, then that's
okay too, I guess,

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I don't think she is.

00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:28.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have a hunch that she's...

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:31.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki...

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it okay if I verify her ID?

00:11:33.394 --> 00:11:34.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do what?

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:36.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was thinking about going to
the nearby town

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:39.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
and have myself a good hard
look at Fuko Ibuki.

00:11:39.634 --> 00:11:42.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's stupid! Don't do it!

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
And why not?

00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:49.377 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>I think if he sees the</i>
 <i>hospitalized Fuko,</i>
 <i>he'll forget Fuko too.</i>

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki...

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not telling me
something, are you?

00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:56.117 position:5% line:89% align:start
About Fuko Ibuki.

00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:03.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't want to tell me,
I won't force you,

00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:06.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I have to check it out
or I won't be satisfied.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:16.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Excuse me, little boy,
here you go.

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:19.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Excuse me...

00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:26.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
That guy was even a more ardent
fan than the others.

00:12:26.415 --> 00:12:29.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are even more people
passing her by than yesterday.

00:12:29.717 --> 00:12:31.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Good morning, Nagisa!

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:32.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
And you too, Okazaki.

00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:34.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Morning?
It's lunch time already.

00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:37.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Sunohara, did you just
arrive at school?

00:12:38.092 --> 00:12:40.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] A strange thing
happened...

00:12:40.662 --> 00:12:43.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that what amnesia's like?

00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:45.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
A little while ago,
when I came to,

00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:47.768 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was walking out of a hospital
in the neighboring town.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:51.772 position:5% line:77% align:start
I honestly don't remember
at all why I went all the
way over there.

00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:54.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, why did I go
to a hospital?

00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:56.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe I was half asleep
in a daze.

00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:59.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara, don't you
want one of Fuko's starfish?

00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:01.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] A starfish?

00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:03.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You haven't received
one yet, have you?

00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:05.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you please accept this?

00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:08.757 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, Youhei!

00:13:08.857 --> 00:13:10.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Kyou!

00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were late again today,
weren't you? Remember

00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:14.329 position:5% line:77% align:start
that if you don't have enough
attendance days, don't look
at me!

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.567 position:5% line:77% align:start
So tell me why you're
so concerned about my
attendance all of a sudden?

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:21.136 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] When you cut classes, the
teacher scolds my sister, the
class leader.

00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:23.673 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] And that is not
cool with me.
[Nagisa] Fu-chan...

00:13:23.772 --> 00:13:25.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Huh? What's that?

00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:27.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
It looks like a star.

00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:30.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you guys holding
on to those things?

00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:34.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Sis, doesn't it remind
you of something?

00:13:34.384 --> 00:13:36.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I kind of feel
that way too.

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:38.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this is Fu-chan!
Don't you remember?

00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:40.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
We all had a pretend
class together.

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:43.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can't you see her? She's right
here! Look at her!

00:13:46.763 --> 00:13:48.331 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, you should have
one like it at home!

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:50.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you took one,
you have to remember it.

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, Kyou, you simply
have to remember!

00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:57.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] No good, I can't
remember.

00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:59.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! It's so irritating!

00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:01.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Sis, calm down.

00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:05.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh Fu-chan...

00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:09.687 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] So, the forgetting</i>
 <i>starts with those who didn't</i>

00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:12.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Someday, I too...</i>

00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:26.737 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:31.108 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] You were always by</i>

accept this?
[Girl A] So where were you?

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:51.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl A] Really? Where?
[Fuko] Excuse me.

00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:53.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Will you please
accept this?

00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:56.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Take this, please.

00:14:57.101 --> 00:14:58.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Hey, the two of you.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
You want to go eat?

00:15:00.438 --> 00:15:04.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, go on by yourself,
we're a little busy here.

00:15:04.743 --> 00:15:07.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, being alone with this
guy is boring, isn't it?

00:15:07.612 --> 00:15:10.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's go to the cafeteria
and talk of love!

00:15:10.849 --> 00:15:12.851 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh... Well... Well we...

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop it, will ya?!

00:15:16.987 --> 00:15:19.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tch. Why are you acting
so irritated?

00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:24.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Fuko, will you say
something to him already?

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:28.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh-oh. I just said something
really strange, didn't I?

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:29.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] A person's name...

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:31.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just said a girl's name,
didn't you?!

00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:34.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, please!
You have to remember!

00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:38.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
N..No, I can't.

00:15:38.243 --> 00:15:41.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't remember anymore.

00:15:41.146 --> 00:15:42.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
But there's a feeling left,

00:15:42.447 --> 00:15:44.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
like there was someone
like that.

00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:46.685 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's kind of hard to explain it.

00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:52.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here. Take this.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
So why do I have something
like this little thing?

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:02.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it exactly?

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
Some kind of star?
Is it a shuriken?

00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:07.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't understand.

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:12.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki, Nagisa,
please listen.

00:16:12.244 --> 00:16:16.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't- I didn't dislike her.
I honestly didn't.

00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:18.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what I think at least.

00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:20.853 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] It's Fu-chan, Sunohara.

00:16:20.953 --> 00:16:22.555 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Fuko!

00:16:22.655 --> 00:16:24.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Fuko-chan?

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's all right,
that's enough.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks so much,
you're a good friend.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's such a kind person.

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:36.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
No. He's an idiot!

00:16:36.603 --> 00:16:38.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
He didn't even try to be close
friends with Fuko

00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:40.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
when he could see her and
the just wasn't cool.

00:16:40.172 --> 00:16:43.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
He is going to come to
Miss Ibuki's wedding.

00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:46.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you forget about
that, Okazaki.

00:16:48.314 --> 00:16:50.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you going to the
wedding in that outfit?

00:16:52.017 --> 00:16:55.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] If I go home,
I have other clothes.

00:16:55.187 --> 00:16:57.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We can't go get them,
can we?

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:02.128 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] The wedding will be
held at school, so isn't the
uniform still appropriate?

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's true, but shall
we buy some accessories?

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] I don't have any money.

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.504 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] If it's not anything
extravagant, I'll buy it
for you.

00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:13.240 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] When is your birthday?
[Fuko] July.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.943 position:5% line:77% align:start
If it's in July then it's a
little early for a birthday
present.

00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:20.146 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll do it to commemorate
your promise never to say
"the worst" again.

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:21.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll keep on saying it.

00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:23.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, to commemorate your
graduation from starfish.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
I will walk with the
starfish forever!

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:29.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, come on Okazaki I think
that our desire to purchase our

00:17:29.456 --> 00:17:32.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
friend Fu-chan a present is good
enough, don't you?

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess so.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.599 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] [laughs] It doesn't
match her!
[Nagisa] Okazaki stop!

00:17:38.699 --> 00:17:41.268 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] That was very insulting!
[Tomoya] It doesn't match
her at all!

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh. This is your
kind of stuff.

00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:48.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's a birthday
party set.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko!

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:53.447 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan?

00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:57.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I imagined myself
wearing that.

00:17:57.752 --> 00:18:00.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I take it that you really
want this then?

00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:02.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't want it!

00:18:02.223 --> 00:18:03.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Then, let's go.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
You are such a little child.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no! I can't seem to get
it out of my head!

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's so very enticing. I can't
stop thinking about it!

00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:15.636 position:5% line:77% align:start
If Nagisa and I weren't here,
Okazaki, you'd buy it for me
in a second. I know you would.

00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:17.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would never.

00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:20.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so very, very happy.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, just as long
as you're happy.

00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:29.183 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have to say, that I'm starting
to feel that you're not such a
bad sort, Okazaki.

00:18:29.283 --> 00:18:32.421 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] That's weird, because
you've thought of me as a bad
person up until now.

00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
I like you better than
a sea slug.

00:18:35.057 --> 00:18:36.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Really? Great!

00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:39.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I have no idea what
level that would be.

00:18:39.394 --> 00:18:43.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
I like the sea slug fairly well,
so you should be glad.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you think that's
nice, Okazaki?

00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:47.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Right now,</i>
 <i>Fuko thinks...</i>

00:18:49.538 --> 00:18:51.106 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I really don't want to
be sandwiched between
those things.

00:18:51.206 --> 00:18:54.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki just has a sharp tongue.

00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:57.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's really a warm person
on the inside.

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:02.085 position:5% line:77% align:start
Furukawa, I'm surprised you can
say such embarrassing things
out loud like that.

00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it embarrassing to you?

00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:08.190 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm leaving.

00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:14.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!

00:19:14.563 --> 00:19:16.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look, Okazaki, a fountain!

00:19:21.104 --> 00:19:24.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fu-chan, ook over here
a pretty fountain!

00:19:33.716 --> 00:19:34.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomya] Hello?

00:19:34.484 --> 00:19:36.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] We're all home!

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:37.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:39.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:40.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, Dad?

00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:42.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, no, no there's
nothing wrong.

00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:45.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought there was a girl
standing between the two of you.

00:19:45.495 --> 00:19:47.998 position:5% line:83% align:start
Been like this all day.
I don't know.

00:19:48.098 --> 00:19:51.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
It feels like I've forgotten to
do something very important.

00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:55.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like I might even eat Sanae's
pastries by mistake.

00:19:55.139 --> 00:19:57.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
For times like this,
this is the only remedy.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be hitting some balls
with the kids.

00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:03.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Come on!

00:20:03.546 --> 00:20:05.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Dad's having a hard
time with it.

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:10.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] He hasn't forgotten
completely, like Sunohara
and Kyou.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:11.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] I know.

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.557 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Akio likes you too.

00:20:13.657 --> 00:20:15.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why he's suffering so.

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:17.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Then, I'm happy.

00:20:19.997 --> 00:20:21.297 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Mother?

00:20:22.198 --> 00:20:24.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
Welcome home, my darling Nagisa,

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:28.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
and to Mr. Okazaki,
and you Fuko.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Glad to be here.
[Nagisa] We're all home now.

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:34.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Did you have fun
at school today?

00:20:34.912 --> 00:20:39.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perhaps maybe the three of us
can take a hot bath together.

00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:43.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
Little Fuko? And my little
daughter Nagisa as well.

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:45.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mother?

00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:51.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanea] I can't see Fuko!

00:20:51.863 --> 00:20:54.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
[crying] Today, I went
to the hospital.

00:20:54.331 --> 00:20:56.034 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard about Miss
Ibuki's marriage

00:20:56.134 --> 00:21:02.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
and thought Fuko might be
Miss Ibuki's sister, so I went
to verify it.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.111 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Sanae...
[Sanae] Since then, I've been
just like Akio.

00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:09.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Our dear little Fuko is
disappearing from our minds.

00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:15.754 position:5% line:77% align:start
But she... Fuko's still here,
isn't she? Tell me she's
still here!

00:21:15.854 --> 00:21:19.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, she is, she's right here.
She's right here.

00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:22.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dear Fuko...

00:21:22.228 --> 00:21:25.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can stay here forever,
if you want to.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
Akio, Nagisa and I all think
of you as family.

00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:39.811 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] This moment
really comes.

00:21:39.912 --> 00:21:44.582 position:5% line:77% align:start
So it seems that my own
mother and father have
already forgot.

00:21:47.652 --> 00:21:49.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, do you want to
go to school, Fuko?

00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:52.490 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] Huh?
[Tomoya] My dad's gonna be
at my house all night

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:55.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I don't think I have time to
take you to Sunohara's place.

00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:44.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki...
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:23:45.072 --> 00:23:48.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] That dream about you that
I mentioned before...

00:23:48.109 --> 00:23:49.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you remember it?

00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:51.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Dream?

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:54.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] The dream about the
Starfish Festival.

00:23:54.615 --> 00:23:56.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ever since I met you and Nagisa,

00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:58.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's what it's been like.

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:00.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
You always took me
to fun places.

00:24:00.821 --> 00:24:02.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
Every day was like a festival.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's been a lot of fun.

00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:06.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:24:06.594 --> 00:24:08.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had a lot of fun.

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:11.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
The most fun I've ever had.
