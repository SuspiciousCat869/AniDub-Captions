[Nagisa] If you'd like...

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:07.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll take you to a
special place in town.

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
A place where...
all your wishes come true.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh... uh...

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:24.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you doing out here
this late at night, Okazaki?

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:26.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you forget something
at our house?

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:29.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] N-no, I was
just out for a walk.

00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:31.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what were you
doing just now?

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
Referencing lines from a play.
It's a really beautiful story

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:39.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I want to do if I can
revive the Drama Club.

00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:42.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
So it was just
lines from a play?

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.902 position:5% line:89% align:start
I always come here to practice.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
I saw you, so I decided
to do it for you.

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:51.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, you've decided to start
up the Drama Club again?

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:55.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, yes! Of course, I don't
know how far I'll get,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I would really
like to give it a try.

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:02.322 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.169 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] The girl's</i>
 <i>life was very lonely.</i>

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>There was no one</i>
 <i>else besides the girl.</i>

00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:50.413 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>That was only natural.</i>

00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:53.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Nothing is born here...</i>

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Neither does anything die.</i>

00:02:57.153 --> 00:02:59.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>That's the kind</i>
 <i>of world this is.</i>

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>That body was for me.</i>

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Do I just have to wish it?</i>

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>To be born here?</i>

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>The one warm spot</i>
 <i>in this world...</i>

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:20.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Before I realized it...</i>

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>that's what I was seeking.</i>

00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:34.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
Reviving the Drama Club is she?

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I suppose it'll
keep her from being bored.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya!
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:43.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get out of the waaaaaay!

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:44.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya yells]

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:49.613 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, be careful, will ya?!

00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:52.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should watch were you're
going! You almost killed me!

00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:59.291 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou laughs] To tell you
the truth, I'm not used
to driving this thing.

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:01.594 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just got my license last week.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.967 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good. Not even a scratch.

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:10.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like I won't charge
you for any repairs.

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:12.272 position:5% line:89% align:start
You had better be grateful.

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:14.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen here. If either
of us should be grateful,

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's you that I don't
have you arrested.

00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:18.046 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou laughs]

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kyou Fujibayashi, eh?
Have you ever noticed,

00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:24.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's a lot of violent
girls at this school.

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:26.989 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well look who's
decided to show up.

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:29.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
Pretty unusual for
you to be on time.

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:33.096 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, you see, I like to pay
people back as soon as possible.

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:36.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I am referring to
that other violent girl.

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:39.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You sure
are persistent.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was out of practice
the other day!

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:43.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
Things are different today!
And for your information,

00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:45.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
if somebody doesn't
pitch for while,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
even the best pitcher around...

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:49.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
could easily have his balls hit!

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:52.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] I would have</i>
 <i>phrased that differently.</i>

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:56.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Trust me, I'd turn and
walk away now, if I were you.

00:04:56.155 --> 00:05:01.495 position:5% line:77% align:start
Or don't you care that you may
not be able to walk yourself
to school anymore?

00:05:01.596 --> 00:05:04.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei chuckles] Don't worry,
we'll see who will be the one

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:06.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
who won't be able to
come back to school.

00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:09.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a sorry excuse for a man.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:13.576 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey you there, looking
stupid. You vouch for me
that this was self defense?

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:16.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sure, he's the one
who's starting it, after all.

00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:19.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay. Now, what do you
want me to do to you?

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:22.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about I turn you into
something a little less human?

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] You think
you can do that?!

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:27.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
Never mind all this yammering,
just come amd fight me already!

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yells]

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, he's really flying...

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:36.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
You there! Get the
trash chute open!

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! Oh, yeah!

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei shouts]

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:45.111 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Help me!

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:51.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] If you let go,
you'll fall. What will you do?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you wanna fall? I see.

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:56.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I haven't said a thing!

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:05.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did I go too far?

00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:08.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's cool. He's small,
but resilient!

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey! You okay?
Are you alive or not?

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:15.947 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei, in the distance]
Damn! I'm not gonna let
this be the end of it!

00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:19.150 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] See?
[Tomoyo] I wish he'd just
let this whole thing between

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.586 position:5% line:89% align:start
the two of us drop.

00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:24.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you know, watching the
two of you boys together,

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
I sort of feel a
little nostalgic.

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:28.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:29.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nothing at all.

00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:31.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forget I said anything.

00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:36.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy 1] You saw it, right?

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.240 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 2] Yeah, I guess
it's really true.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:42.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, it was here just now,

00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:43.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
the ghost of that student!

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:45.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, the one
they're talking about!

00:06:45.414 --> 00:06:46.716 position:5% line:89% align:start
She comes up and approaches you,

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:49.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then gives you something
with a curse on it.

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
She looks like an average girl,
but there's something about her

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:54.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
where you can tell
she's not quite right.

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:02.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Looks like
it's unlocked.

00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perfect. Looks like I'll
be able to take a nap.

00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:23.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
He-hey! Don't do that!

00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:25.527 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Huh?
[Tomoya] That book
belongs to the library!

00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:27.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't just cut
it up like that.

00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:31.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow, these are some
pretty advanced textbooks.

00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:38.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, are you a truant as
well as a library vandal?

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:40.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what are you
barefoot anyway?

00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:47.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
I made this lunch all by myself.

00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:50.789 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Kotomi] I think this
came out especially well.

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know you're not suppose to
eat or drink in the library.

00:07:53.892 --> 00:07:55.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
Would you like some?

00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:02.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, since you offered.

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:04.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Oh no.
[Tomoya] What's the matter?

00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
I only have one
pair of chopsticks.

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:08.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]

00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:18.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's really good!

00:08:21.124 --> 00:08:23.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
You might want to get started
cleaning this stuff up.

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:25.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Classes are going to start
in a couple of minutes.

00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:28.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there something
else you need to do?

00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:33.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:36.841 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] That wasn't the</i>
 <i>ghost of the girl who died</i>
 <i>in that accident, I hope.</i>

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was probably Kotomi
Ichinose of Class A.

00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:42.948 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi Ichinose?

00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:45.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's a genius who ranks in
the top ten at every subject

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.655 position:5% line:83% align:start
on the national mock exams.
I understand that she's

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:52.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
free to cut classes anytime.
And study whatever she wants.

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:55.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's practically a legend
in our school, you know.

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:57.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, so she's a genius, is she?

00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:59.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then it's no wonder
she was so strange.

00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:02.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, about your big sister...
Your parents really need to

00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
think about keeping
her on a leash.

00:09:04.807 --> 00:09:06.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Did my sister
do something to you?

00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:09.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, as a matter of fact!
She and her bi-

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:11.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, you! Tomoya!
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:16.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Come with me right now!
[Tomoya] Huh?!

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.254 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girl 1] Did he just say "bi"?

00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:18.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Did they just say "bi"?

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:19.157 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girl 2] What's "bi"?

00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:20.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
Bi?

00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:22.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright, you big mouth.
What were you planning

00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:24.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
to say in the middle
of the classroom?!

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was planning to tell
your sister that you an-

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:29.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, you nitwit, are you
trying to get me expelled?

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:33.606 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know it's against the
school policy to come to
come here on a bike!

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:38.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, what were you talking
about with my sister just now?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
Alright, everybody! Listen up!

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:44.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
I found out Kyou Fujibayashi,
in Class E, is bi!

00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:46.855 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Boy] "Bi"?
[Girl] "Bi"?
[More students
question the "bi" part]

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:49.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's bi?

00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:50.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 1] Bi?
[Boy 2] What is bi?

00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:53.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now that you mention it,
she is a little masculine.

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:00.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I'm... gonna kill you!
[Tomoya] I... can't breathe!

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.174 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Is it true, sis,
what he just said?
[Tomoya] Can't breathe!

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:05.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on! Don't you
believe him too!

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:06.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a "bike"!
A motorized scooter!

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know, like a Vespa!

00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:14.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:20.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What's wrong?

00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:23.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you on clean-up duty?

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:26.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
All alone?

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:29.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's the matter?

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did something happen
to you today?

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, it's nothing, Okazaki.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:37.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'll
be done real soon.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you go and wait
for me in the club room?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.691 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Okay.

00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here's my thought.
We won't get anywhere

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
unless we get more
members to join.

00:10:51.662 --> 00:10:53.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
I say we put up
a recruitment sign.

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:55.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:10:56.335 --> 00:10:59.405 position:5% line:83% align:start
But we should probably wait
until after Founder's Day.

00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:00.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:11:02.374 --> 00:11:03.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm done!

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:06.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
But isn't your sign
missing something?

00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:07.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Hm. What could that be?

00:11:08.014 --> 00:11:10.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
What if you add the line,
"The most beautiful and sweet

00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:15.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
club leader on campus will be
there and be waiting for you"?

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:19.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] "The most beautiful
club leader on camp-"

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you... You wouldn't
be referring to m-

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:23.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, who else would
I be talking about?

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:26.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] What?!
[Tomoya] If you write that,

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:28.805 position:5% line:77% align:start
maybe some of the dumb
guys in class will take
the bait and join.

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:31.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want people to come
because of something like that!

00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:34.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, you're the one who
should be the leader, not me!

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
As I said yesterday, I'm only
doing this to help you out.

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:39.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have no vested interest
in any drama club.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:44.322 position:5% line:77% align:start
Even if the club is revived,
I have no intention of
being a member of it.

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.024 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you being serious?

00:11:46.124 --> 00:11:48.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the one who should
be the leader in any of

00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:49.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
the drama club's activities.

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:52.932 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, it's the leader
who makes all the decisions.

00:11:53.032 --> 00:11:56.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are plays that you
wanna do, aren't there?

00:11:56.403 --> 00:11:59.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
I... I don't know if
I can do it or not.

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:00.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on now, get cracking.

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:02.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just write whatever slogan
you want on the poster.

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:04.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it'll be amazing.

00:12:05.613 --> 00:12:07.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really? Anything I want?

00:12:07.316 --> 00:12:10.685 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well then, could I
maybe draw my very,
very favorite picture on it?

00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:12.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well... Yeah, sure. Why not?

00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:15.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
It would look sort of dull
if it only had just words.

00:12:15.492 --> 00:12:18.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really?! In that case...

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:26.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
♪Dango, dango, dango,
dango, dango.♪

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
♪Big dango family!

00:12:29.307 --> 00:12:31.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]
[Nagisa] There!

00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:35.914 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya sighs in frustration]
Okay, maybe that song was
popular way back.

00:12:36.014 --> 00:12:38.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes! It's called
"Big Dango Family"!

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's my favorite song!

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Why "Big Dango Family"?

00:12:43.524 --> 00:12:46.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's so old.
It's not popular anymore.

00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:50.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I still think that it's
a really cute song to sing.

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:52.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying you
don't like it?

00:12:53.068 --> 00:12:54.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, no! Never mind, really!

00:12:54.803 --> 00:12:56.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine, as long
as you want to do it.

00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, I did tell you
to do whatever you want.

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:01.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tonkatsu!

00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:02.611 position:5% line:89% align:start
W-what?!

00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:08.385 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's just something I say
to cheer myself up when
I'm embarassed.

00:13:08.485 --> 00:13:13.657 position:5% line:77% align:start
If I do really well, I
promise to reward myself
with a favorite food.

00:13:13.757 --> 00:13:16.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's weird, isn't it?
[Nagisa chuckles nervously]

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No, it's not weird.

00:13:18.796 --> 00:13:22.601 position:5% line:77% align:start
On our way home, let's
pick up a big dango family
instead of a tonkatsu.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:25.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
After we put up all
the signs, that is.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:31.811 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I have too
much time on my hands.

00:13:56.672 --> 00:13:59.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry,
did I scare you?

00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:01.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean to.

00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:03.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you mind telling me
if this the Art Club room?

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:05.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you're just doing your art

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:08.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
class homework here then?

00:14:08.254 --> 00:14:09.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh!

00:14:09.355 --> 00:14:10.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, what is that?

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you mean this?

00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:14.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:16.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
my favorite...

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:17.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
ever...

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:19.733 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:23.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko chuckles, then goes
into amorous sighing]

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.382 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:39.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
The blade is chipped.

00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:41.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's dangerous to be using
a dull knife like this.

00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:43.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it back to me!

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really should be
using a carving knife

00:14:44.962 --> 00:14:46.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's properly sharpened.
I'm sure that they must

00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:48.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
have a few extras
in the art room.

00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:50.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it back, please?!

00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:52.304 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your hand hurts, doesn't it?

00:14:53.171 --> 00:14:54.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
It doesn't hurt.

00:14:54.272 --> 00:14:56.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Give me five!
[Fuko] Okay!

00:14:57.008 --> 00:14:58.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
See there? Your hand does hurts.

00:14:58.444 --> 00:15:00.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
It doesn't hurt!

00:15:01.814 --> 00:15:02.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon. Five up high.

00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:04.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean like a high five?

00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like in basketball. You know
how when you make a basket,

00:15:06.752 --> 00:15:08.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
you slap the other
players on their hand.

00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:11.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know about that!
I've seen it on the TV!

00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:13.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, give me a high five.
C'mon, let's do it.

00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:16.465 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dribble, dribble... Shoot!

00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:17.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Do you have
to start there?

00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:19.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
I did it!

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:22.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay! That was a really
nice shot! Way to go!

00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:24.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Both] Yeah!

00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:27.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
See there? It hurts, doesn't it?

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I'll hold
on to this for ya.

00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:32.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess I'll see ya around.

00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:39.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's the last one.
Good job.

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:41.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Drama Club Member Wanted?"

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me this this
is what you've been up to?

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:46.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
What about you, man? What
have you been doing all day?

00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:49.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
Special training to
defeat Tomoyo Sakagami.

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:52.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the Drama Club?
Are you serious?

00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:57.911 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm amazed that you're
interested in something as
disgusting as club activities.

00:15:58.012 --> 00:16:04.219 position:5% line:77% align:start
I mean, come on. I thought those
guys doing club activities made
you sick enough to throw up.

00:16:06.254 --> 00:16:08.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh well. Maybe one day
I'll let you explain it all.

00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:10.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
See ya around.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki...

00:16:15.064 --> 00:16:18.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, do you really
hate club activities?

00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:21.272 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, i-it was nothing.

00:16:21.372 --> 00:16:22.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
He was just talking.

00:16:26.712 --> 00:16:30.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What else can I do,
if they no longer sell them.

00:16:30.883 --> 00:16:33.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, this is better than
nothing I suppose.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoyuki] Oh, how nostalgic...

00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:45.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, son. What are
you going to do with this?

00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:48.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm giving it to a
friend of mine, alright?

00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:51.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.
Why not let me help you, son?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
What should I do?

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
Won't you tell me?

00:16:57.213 --> 00:16:59.015 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't touch it!

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:00.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
GOD!

00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:01.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will ya just quit it already?!

00:17:01.984 --> 00:17:03.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why do you have to talk
to me like I'm some

00:17:03.654 --> 00:17:05.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
kind of a stranger?!

00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:06.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
What am I to you, anyway?!

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
WHAT AM I?!

00:17:10.094 --> 00:17:11.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Naoyuki] Tomoya...

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:36.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa gasps]
It's the Big Dango Family!

00:17:36.924 --> 00:17:39.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not the real
thing, of course.

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:42.097 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:44.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
You've made me really happy.

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:46.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's really a big family.

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:54.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish... I just wish I could
become one of the big dangos.

00:17:55.246 --> 00:17:56.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've been depressed all day.

00:17:56.981 --> 00:18:00.852 position:5% line:77% align:start
At clean-up time,
the whole class was
working together at first,

00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:03.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
but before I knew it,
I was all alone.

00:18:03.622 --> 00:18:04.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I see...

00:18:05.023 --> 00:18:08.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, I've
always been kind of clumsy.

00:18:08.728 --> 00:18:13.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everybody I've always known used
to always tease me about it.

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
But now, thanks to you,
I feel so much better!

00:18:16.737 --> 00:18:19.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not depressed
at all anymore.

00:18:25.648 --> 00:18:28.384 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] That stuff we were
talking about earlier...
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:18:28.484 --> 00:18:32.354 position:5% line:77% align:start
My friend and I were
drafted a long time
ago as school athletes.

00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:34.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
You do know what that
means, don't you?

00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:38.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara was signed
for the soccer team.

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:40.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
And me, I got signed
for the basketball squad.

00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:43.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I quit as soon as
I entered this school.

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:46.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
So did you come to hate
playing basketball?

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it at all.

00:18:47.873 --> 00:18:52.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I can't remember the last
time I touched a basketball.

00:18:52.478 --> 00:18:55.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Okazaki. In that case,
why not play with me?

00:18:56.081 --> 00:18:59.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's play basketball
after school tomorrow.

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:02.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
I may not look it,
but I've got good reflexes.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll wait for you at the
basketball court after school.

00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:06.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, that's okay.

00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:09.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's play basketball.

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:17.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei snoring]

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:20.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, why
not play with me?

00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:23.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's play basketball
after school tomorrow!

00:19:25.215 --> 00:19:27.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki,
let's cut school today.

00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:30.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's Saturday and school's
just a half day today.

00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:32.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well...

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:33.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Thunder rumbles]

00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:42.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Why do you keep looking
outta the window like that?

00:19:48.108 --> 00:19:50.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you mind if I borrow
your umbrella, Sunohara?

00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:52.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:53.915 --> 00:19:55.716 position:5% line:89% align:start
She wouldn't be still...

00:20:01.723 --> 00:20:03.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya gasp]

00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:07.430 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:20:11.902 --> 00:20:13.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Okazaki...

00:20:13.537 --> 00:20:15.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you some kind of idiot?!
It's raining.

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should've gone
home a long time ago!

00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:22.714 position:5% line:77% align:start
But if you came after I left,
I wouldn't have been able
to meet you to play.

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:25.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
There was no guarantee that
I would come, was there?

00:20:25.952 --> 00:20:29.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you... you did come,
didn't you?

00:20:30.057 --> 00:20:34.193 position:5% line:77% align:start
You see, you've always
been there to help me
with my problems.

00:20:34.293 --> 00:20:39.901 position:5% line:77% align:start
So I thought I could at least
play basketball with you
to pay you back.

00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:42.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] In this rain?
How can we?

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:47.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, just show me
how you shoot a basket.

00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:53.717 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wanna see it. I've never seen
a basketball player shoot a
basket up close.

00:20:53.817 --> 00:20:58.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
You take a cool stance like
this before shooting, right?

00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:02.292 position:5% line:77% align:start
A real professional doesn't
throw underhand like
I do, do they?

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:31.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't raise my right
arm anymore at all.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:35.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
When I was in the ninth grade,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
my dad and I got in a bad fight.

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:39.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
Injured my right
shoulder pretty badly.

00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:42.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
The best doctors tried
to fix the problem.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I can't play
basketball anymore.

00:21:46.743 --> 00:21:47.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Never again.

00:21:50.882 --> 00:21:54.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
I-I didn't mean t-...

00:21:54.752 --> 00:21:55.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
Furukawa, no!

00:21:55.888 --> 00:21:56.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm always...

00:21:57.056 --> 00:21:59.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm always causing
you trouble...

00:21:59.223 --> 00:22:01.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just ha- ah, aah.

00:22:02.028 --> 00:22:03.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Furukawa!

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
Furukawa... Furukawa!

00:23:43.844 --> 00:23:46.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, you may be
just a little silly,

00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:47.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I think it's kind of sweet.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Really? You do?
[Tomoya] Yeah, if you ask me,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.124 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] you're not really the
type to handle something like
this that easily, are you?

00:23:55.224 --> 00:23:59.061 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] You don't think so?
[Tomoya] I'm the type of guy who
says exactly what he thinks.

00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:00.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're telling me...

00:24:00.563 --> 00:24:02.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sometimes your words stab me.

00:24:02.598 --> 00:24:05.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry 'bout that.
Believe in your own words.

00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:10.107 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] 'Kay...
[Tomoya] I want you to keep
hangin' in there, okay?

00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:11.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will!
