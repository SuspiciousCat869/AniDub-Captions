00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:03.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] How did it go?

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:05.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm at a loss
for words.

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:07.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What did they tell you?

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:10.332 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] All recruitment for
potiential new members
is forbidden.

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:12.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why in the world would they?

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] The Drama Club is
currently on hiatus,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:18.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
so club activities are
suspended as well.

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:22.145 position:5% line:77% align:start
Therefore, they cannot
approve the posting of
recruiting posters.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.450 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's ridiculous! Not to
mention unfair! They
can't do that!

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:27.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you just tell them,
"Okay, I understand?"

00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:30.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
I did my best to convince them,

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:33.558 position:5% line:77% align:start
but all they would say were
rules are rules and they
can't bent.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.603 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't want you to give up.
There just has to be a way
to get what you want.

00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:44.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
You really think so?

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to start one
up on our own.

00:00:46.707 --> 00:00:47.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not right you would
have to

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
give up your dream
because of this.

00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:51.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh Okazaki!

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:53.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] So tell me, are you
seeing that Drama Club girl?

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:32.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:33.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
I thought it was odd that you

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:35.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
should get involved with a club.

00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:36.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you're just doing
it to be with her,

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:38.341 position:5% line:89% align:start
then I can understand.

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, her family runs a
little shop, a bakery.

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:47.651 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Huh?
[Tomoya] The pastries her mother
makes are really good.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] If you taste it once,
you'll be hooked.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:53.526 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you're friends with her,
you can eat all the pastries
you like.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?! Are you serious?

00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:58.898 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] If not, I wouldn't be
involved with the Drama Club,
would I?

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, it's true I don't really
think that she's your type.

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:04.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's plain and seems so
earnest and goody-goody.

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:09.111 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You just go on thinking
about getting revenge on Tomoyo
Sakagami.

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:09.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:10.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
[cat meows]

00:03:14.883 --> 00:03:16.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
You really are persistent.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think so too.

00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:20.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just came because I wanted
to see you,

00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:22.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're so beautiful, you know.

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I can't believe
anything you say.

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:26.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
[yells]
Oh, no!

00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:29.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've forgotten the fake breasts
I needed for my next class!

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:32.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo, would you please lend
me your breasts, will you?!

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.272 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:03:33.372 --> 00:03:34.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
I did it! I caught you!

00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
See that? Did you see that?!

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:38.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you trying
to say exactly?

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:41.249 position:5% line:77% align:start
Her asking why means she
can lend her breast to
me, right?

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.086 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then that- That means
her breasts aren't real!
They're removable!

00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:46.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course they aren't removable.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:47.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] See there!

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
In the first place...

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:50.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
In the first place?

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei yelling]

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll get her next time.

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:59.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
You intend to continue this?

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:02.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course! Just watch me,
I'll get her next time!

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:05.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute,
there's the weird guy!

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not a weird guy, so it has
nothing to do with me.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, Weird Guy.

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:11.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you talking to me?

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:12.853 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's only natural!

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:15.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no one around here
as weird as you.

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
Someone weird like you
appears once in ten years.

00:04:17.626 --> 00:04:20.895 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't think it's an
exaggeration to say
something like that.

00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:23.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I know for sure it's
not an exaggeration!

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:26.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't need to thank me.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm Tomoya Okazaki of 3-D and
this is my friend Youhei.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who is this little kid?

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is she someone you know?

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like it's double
weird guys!

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? And just what is weird
about me?

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your hair is an
impossible color!

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:44.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Our first meeting?
That's a rude thing to say.

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:47.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just want to talk to
Weird Guy #1.

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to speak privately,
so come with me.

00:04:51.132 --> 00:04:52.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] This is far enough.

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:55.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
What I wanted to talk about...

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Both] What?

00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:58.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Oh no! It's double
weird guys!

00:04:58.408 --> 00:04:59.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Both] You told us to
come with you.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:02.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] But I only wanted
to talk to you!

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:05.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said I was a weird guy too.
Or have you forgotten?

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's because you
have weird hair!

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you, your whole existence
in life is weird!

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:13.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
This kid is definitely
picking a fight.

00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:15.194 position:5% line:83% align:start
She says my whole existence
is weird.

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're lucky she says only
a part of you is weird.

00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:20.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Don't worry, I'll let
it go this time, little girl.

00:05:22.737 --> 00:05:24.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Okay now, Weird Guy...

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:25.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I told you, stop
calling me that.

00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:27.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] I forgot your name.

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:29.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
I told you, I'm Tomoya Okazaki.

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:31.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, Okazaki.

00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:33.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you have something that
you want to say to me?

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:35.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something to say?

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:36.986 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:05:37.788 --> 00:05:40.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
One, two, one, two, one, two...

00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
One, two.

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:42.993 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please stop that!

00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:44.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's about the present
I gave you.

00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:46.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying that was
a present?

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:47.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Yes, it was.

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:49.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, well thank you.

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:50.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later!

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Please wait!

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:54.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
My one and only big sister's
getting married very soon.

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:58.212 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Is that so?
[Fuko] She's marrying someone
named Yusuke.

00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:00.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
Won't you please congratulate
the both of them?

00:06:00.948 --> 00:06:04.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko's sister, congratulations
then. See you.

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.756 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] That's not it!
[Tomoya] What is it?
I congratulated her.

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:10.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to congratulate her
on the day on her wedding day,

00:06:10.594 --> 00:06:11.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
where it happens.

00:06:11.828 --> 00:06:13.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
So in other words,
you gave me a present,

00:06:13.663 --> 00:06:16.701 position:5% line:77% align:start
and you want me to attend your
sister's wedding with you?
Is that it?

00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:17.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's it.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.170 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why me?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the first place, I don't even
know you very well.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.881 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] Well you see, my sister
was the art teacher at this
school until three years ago.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.519 position:5% line:77% align:start
I want more than anything for
everyone to come to my
sister's wedding.

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I'm giving out these
gifts as invitations.

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] To every single student
at the school?

00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:40.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Yes! If they receive
something as cute as this,

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:42.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
they should all be deeply moved.

00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:44.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's so cute!

00:06:49.706 --> 00:06:50.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:04.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
My nose felt funny just now.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:06.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Darn, she didn't drink any!</i>

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:11.599 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You know,
I think it's impossible.
[Fuko] What is?

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.504 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, I mean, if you said
that your sister worked here
about three years ago,

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:18.908 position:5% line:77% align:start
then she- she wouldn't have
known any of the students
that are here now.

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:23.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
And they wouldn't know your
sister so I doubt they would
come to a stranger's wedding.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:24.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you really think so?

00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:29.688 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, I mean the
seniors are busy with
entrance exams.

00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:31.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I'll do my very best,

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:36.295 position:5% line:77% align:start
I want everyone to celebrate
and rejoice in my big
sister's wedding.

00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
I may not appear so,
but I'm very busy.

00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:44.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say I don't have
much time for this either.

00:07:45.807 --> 00:07:48.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well I think that this time I'll
take a different approach.

00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:50.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you're always claiming
that you'll do that.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:52.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
This time I swear I'm
really different!

00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:54.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
Auck!

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:55.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
Baah!

00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:57.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh my goodness,
are you all right?!

00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:00.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
I inadvertently put everything
in that kick.

00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:02.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was a good kick,
I'll give you that.

00:08:02.326 --> 00:08:04.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
But after any fight always comes
reconciliation.

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:06.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come with me.

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:09.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] What is it now?

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:12.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Come on, never mind.
It's not far.

00:08:12.137 --> 00:08:14.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:15.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] What are you guys
trying to do?

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:17.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
Trying to get me into
the boys' bathroom?

00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:21.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
My gosh, there's no limit to
harassment you give me!

00:08:22.017 --> 00:08:23.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
He just wants to watch you
go to the bathroom

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
and make sure you're
really a girl.

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's all.
[Tomoyo] What?

00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:28.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're too strong, so he
suspects that you may

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:31.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
actually be a guy in
girl's clothing.

00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:35.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you going
to get mad?

00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:37.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] More than that,
I'm shocked.

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
All this time I was under
the impression that I was

00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
finally acting like a girl and
not some bully at this school.

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:45.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're very
sensitive about it.

00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:51.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Even with this, I'm
trying very hard to change.

00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:58.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you worry, I'm not letting
it end like this.

00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:05.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Show a little
more spirit, will ya?

00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:08.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd like to but I don't think
I can think of any good ideas.

00:09:08.304 --> 00:09:12.242 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Instead of putting up
posters, how about handing out
flyers directly?

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
I asked about doing that but
they told me I couldn't.

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:19.452 position:5% line:77% align:start
And I don't think that
collecting signatures for
a petition wouldn't go well.

00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:25.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've heard all about
what you're doing.

00:09:28.428 --> 00:09:29.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Help us attract
club members?

00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:33.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Yeah, besides,
I'm tired of school pastries.

00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:35.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? What pastries?

00:09:35.537 --> 00:09:38.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Nevermind. It has
nothing to do with you.

00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:42.278 position:5% line:77% align:start
What I heard is that the student
council is blocking your
gathering members, right?

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:44.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is gonna be easy.

00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:46.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
So do you have a good idea
on how to help?

00:09:46.584 --> 00:09:49.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
Call the Student Council
chairman out behind the school,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.556 position:5% line:89% align:start
and everybody beat him up!

00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:55.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you mustn't do that!
That would be mean!

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not the Student
Council's fault.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.699 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Well that's the
quickest way to fix this,
isn't it?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] In any case, violence
is not a solution.

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Then, negotiation?

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid that isn't my forte.

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We have a great
difference in values then.

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:10.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
But thank you for your concern.

00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:12.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can you help us non-violently?

00:10:12.815 --> 00:10:15.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay then, you guys just leave
it to me.

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:19.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>If this were a role-</i>
 <i>playing game...</i>

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:22.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Game Voice] Youhei Sunohara</i>

00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:24.195 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:35.742 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>things too simple.</i>

00:10:35.842 --> 00:10:38.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, I have to say, it
really doesn't make any sense

00:10:38.344 --> 00:10:40.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
to think only amongst
yourselves.

00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:43.452 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you both think it's better
to confer with someone
like maybe...?

00:10:43.552 --> 00:10:45.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
You may have a pretty
good point there.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you have someone in mind?

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:50.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course! If I didn't,
I wouldn't mention it.

00:10:50.326 --> 00:10:52.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oi oi oi.

00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:54.932 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Botan, you came again?

00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:58.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] What a problem, we still
have a whole of classes.

00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:01.239 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] We'll catch Tomoya or
Youhei and make them watch her.
[Botan] Oi oi oi.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:02.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure they won't mind at all.

00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:05.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm not mistaken, I think
they're talking about us.

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:10.016 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hm. You would think the class
leader would know the rules
about bringing pets so school.

00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:11.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
But she is with her sister.

00:11:11.718 --> 00:11:14.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, I want you to go and bring
the younger sister over here.

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:16.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you tell her there's someone
who wants to confess his love,

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:18.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
the older sister will probably
stay away.

00:11:18.526 --> 00:11:21.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! Great idea. Good job, man.

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:26.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
What were you and Youhei talking
about just now?

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:29.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You think of what
you're going to ask.

00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:32.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, what do you want?

00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:34.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
The one who wanted
to see you is...

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.514 position:5% line:89% align:start
...her!

00:11:35.614 --> 00:11:36.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:38.750 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm Nagisa
Furukawa of 3-B.

00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:45.058 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry for calling you out
suddenly. I didn't mean to
startle you.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:49.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Uh, that's alright. I'm
Ryou Fujibayashi of D Class.

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You're the Class
Leader, aren't you?

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:52.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Y..Yes!

00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:54.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's terrific.

00:11:54.103 --> 00:11:57.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not something I could ever
do. I really admire you.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it's not such
a great thing.

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have something to ask you.

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:03.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you listen to me, please?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.884 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Yes!
[Tomoya] I want you to answer
as honestly as possible.

00:12:06.984 --> 00:12:10.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's being completely honest
with you, Ryou.

00:12:10.222 --> 00:12:11.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, if you'd wait a minute.

00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:15.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
I uh, I didn't think it was
a girl and I...

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sex really doesn't matter,
does it?

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
The important thing is what's in
the deepest part of your heart.

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:23.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sometimes you're a lot smarter
than you look, you know.

00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:26.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
I get a bad rap but I'm
essentially a good guy.

00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:28.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Is it strange
that I'm a girl?

00:12:28.677 --> 00:12:30.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] No, you're very cute.

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:32.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
But with me?

00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:35.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, what can I say...

00:12:35.117 --> 00:12:36.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm flattered.

00:12:36.552 --> 00:12:38.689 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been a little
troubled by it,

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:41.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I decided to be brave
and embrace it.

00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:45.430 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you were that troubled by it?

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.966 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is kind of exciting.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to be honest, that I
don't know what to do anymore.

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:51.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you would please just
hear me out.

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:54.107 position:5% line:89% align:start
I do understand.

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:56.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will listen to you seriously.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh please... Pretty please...

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:05.187 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you would please, help me
form my own school theatrical
drama club.

00:13:05.287 --> 00:13:06.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:07.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:10.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Kyou!

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyou!

00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:13.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
How dare you ridicule
my sister?!

00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:25.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's the case, why didn't
you say so in the first place?

00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:28.014 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's all his fault.

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:29.415 position:5% line:89% align:start
And what about you?!

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:32.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I'm not very good
at explaining things.

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:35.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
It made my heart beat so fast.
It's okay.

00:13:35.223 --> 00:13:38.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that these are
the only friends you have?

00:13:38.593 --> 00:13:40.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
My friends? Oh, no...

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:45.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're- They're just helping me
restart the school's Drama Club.

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:47.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
They must have an
ulterior motive.

00:13:47.971 --> 00:13:50.374 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you give up these guys
and be friends with us?

00:13:50.473 --> 00:13:52.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're a lot more fun
to be around.

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:53.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh? Um, well I...

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:56.514 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] You think so too,
don't you, Botan?
[Botan] Boi!

00:13:56.615 --> 00:13:58.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
Such a terrible way to put it.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
Getting pastries is your
motive, isn't it?

00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:03.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, I appreciate your thinking
about me,

00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:05.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
but they've been helping me.

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:07.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
And it wouldn't be right to
abandon them like that.

00:14:08.062 --> 00:14:11.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki and Sunohara
are really nice guys.

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:14.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like we've managed
to reconcile.

00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:17.472 position:5% line:77% align:start
You wouldn't by any chance
be after this little red head,
would you?

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:18.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
No. Of course I'm not.

00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:21.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
In order for any student to
reactivate a suspended club,

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:27.151 position:5% line:77% align:start
first you need members.
For club activities, you need
at least three and an advisor.

00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.853 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's the rule.

00:14:28.953 --> 00:14:30.922 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, you're right about that.

00:14:31.022 --> 00:14:31.991 position:5% line:89% align:start
Three then!

00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:33.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it's the recruitment
of those members

00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:35.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
that they're not allowing.

00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:36.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:14:36.463 --> 00:14:38.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] You already have
the head count.

00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:39.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Youhei] I do?

00:14:39.766 --> 00:14:42.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] This girl and
you and you.

00:14:45.673 --> 00:14:47.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya & Youhei] No, no, no...

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Give me a break.

00:14:50.212 --> 00:14:52.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, we're not interested
in doing theatrics.

00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:53.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are we? Well?

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We might not be
able to use

00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:56.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
posters and flyers to recruit,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
but there's no rule against
inviting people. Is there?

00:15:00.724 --> 00:15:03.028 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, interesting idea, man.

00:15:03.128 --> 00:15:05.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
So do you seriously mean
to help her?

00:15:05.263 --> 00:15:08.868 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well yeah, because if I don't
I can't get any of those
delicious pastries.

00:15:08.968 --> 00:15:12.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'll do my best to help
Nagisa earnestly too.

00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:14.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
She seems like a genuienly
nice girl to me.

00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:17.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
School might be fun if I'm
friends with her.

00:15:17.311 --> 00:15:20.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, tomorrow I'll make a
homerun with Tomoyo!

00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's a beautiful
world you live in.

00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:25.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
A homerun!

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well that's kind of out
of the blue.

00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:28.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was just talking to myself!

00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:31.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Exactly how long is
this squable going to go on?

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:35.466 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm truly different today.
My perspective about your
identity has changed at last.

00:15:35.565 --> 00:15:37.001 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] What do you mean?

00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] [whispering] First,
compliment what she's wearing.

00:15:39.237 --> 00:15:42.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
What you have on your hair
looks good on you.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:45.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks, I guess.

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I accept that
Tomoyo is a girl.

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:53.320 position:5% line:77% align:start
Since that's the case, I think I
should simply take advantage
of that.

00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:56.558 position:5% line:77% align:start
Okay, you do realize she
actually can't stand you
at all, right?

00:15:56.657 --> 00:15:58.960 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that is precisely why
I need your help.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, you seem to get along
with Tomoyo.

00:16:01.464 --> 00:16:03.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, well,
better than you.

00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:06.002 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] So, teach me how
to talk to her to get her
to like me.

00:16:06.103 --> 00:16:08.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're better at dating
than I am.

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:11.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
The uniform looks good
on you too!

00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:13.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] You're so creepy.

00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:15.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it going well?

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.681 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's going great, man.

00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:18.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next, I want you to give it a
long stretch and tell her,

00:16:18.884 --> 00:16:20.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
"You're so pretty, you must be

00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:22.455 position:5% line:83% align:start
the most popular girl in the
whole school." You got it?

00:16:22.555 --> 00:16:26.693 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] You're so pretty, you
must be the most popular girl
in the whole school!

00:16:26.793 --> 00:16:28.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] He's really saying it.</i>

00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:30.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Is this working?
[Tomoyo] You're doing fine.

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:35.303 position:5% line:77% align:start
Next, I want you to say, "Oh
man, do I really want a pretty
girlfriend really really bad."

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:36.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
While doing hindu squats.

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:39.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I want a pretty
girlfriend really, really bad.

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:42.579 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] That's totally
unnatural!
[Tomoyo] You're doing fine.

00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:45.415 position:5% line:77% align:start
Next, I want you to make like
you're rolling a bowling ball
and say,

00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:49.020 position:5% line:77% align:start
"Please make my breakfast
every morning for me,
sweet cheeks."

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.326 position:5% line:77% align:start
Tomoyo, please make my breakfast
every morning for me,
sweet cheeks!

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:01.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there any meaning to
these poses?!

00:17:01.469 --> 00:17:02.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Not especially.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then don't make me do them!

00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:07.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, he was teasing me with
these compliments after all?

00:17:07.476 --> 00:17:11.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's the case, the first
move means victory!

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.984 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:26.097 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Sorry man, I
unconsciously kicked you back.
[Youhei] Ouch.

00:17:26.198 --> 00:17:29.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please make this the last time
you talk to me.

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:31.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, wait a minute, Tomoyo.

00:17:31.837 --> 00:17:34.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Do you have any
interest in drama?

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:35.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
In drama?

00:17:35.509 --> 00:17:36.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We're recruiting
members.

00:17:36.843 --> 00:17:39.514 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can wear feminine clothes.

00:17:39.614 --> 00:17:42.850 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] I'm a little
interested, but it's
probably impossible.

00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:45.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's almost time for Student
Council chairman elections.

00:17:45.787 --> 00:17:47.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have no time for
club activities.

00:17:47.756 --> 00:17:49.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
Student Council chairman?

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:51.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be very
busy very soon.

00:17:51.861 --> 00:17:53.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
Find someone else.

00:17:53.863 --> 00:17:55.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
Student Council chairman...

00:17:58.002 --> 00:17:59.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, Ichinose.

00:18:01.573 --> 00:18:03.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ichinose...

00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:07.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] So fast, that's</i>
 <i>a genius for you.</i>

00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:09.415 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kotomi Ichinose.

00:18:11.452 --> 00:18:12.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi.

00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:15.490 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kotomi.

00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:18.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi?

00:18:21.464 --> 00:18:24.934 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Huh?
[Tomoya] I'm Tomoya
Okazaki of 3-D.

00:18:25.034 --> 00:18:27.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're Ichinose
of 3-A, right?

00:18:27.904 --> 00:18:31.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um... Why yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] You're Kotomi Ichinose.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:34.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hear you're famous.

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:36.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can call me Kotomi-chan.

00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:39.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
At least, let me drop the"-chan", will y

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:45.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you would like to come
and read with me?

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:46.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I didn't come to read.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.165 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you like to eat
lunch with me?

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:55.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I came to recruit
you for a club.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have any interest
in acting?

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Acting?

00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:00.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm looking for some
new members.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I can just use your name
maybe to get others...

00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:05.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
My name?

00:19:07.318 --> 00:19:11.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to be honest, it's such
a strange request.

00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:15.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya... kun...

00:19:15.294 --> 00:19:18.432 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No, you don't have to
put a pause there for no reason.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll come back some other time.
Will you please think about it?

00:19:21.868 --> 00:19:22.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya-kun?

00:19:22.969 --> 00:19:25.206 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What?

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:26.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you again.

00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] You had no luck either?

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] No, I asked a number
of students,

00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:35.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
but unfortunatly
no one's intersted.

00:19:35.585 --> 00:19:39.390 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] When you think
about it, no one was interested,
so the club was suspended.

00:19:41.058 --> 00:19:44.895 position:5% line:77% align:start
I thought it would be easy,
but it looks like it'll take
a lot of work.

00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:47.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
The seniors have college exams.

00:19:47.532 --> 00:19:51.104 position:5% line:77% align:start
The sophomores might be
interested because they're
so new to the school.

00:19:51.204 --> 00:19:52.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I don't know a lot of them.

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
The sophomores, yeah...

00:19:59.714 --> 00:20:01.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, you're still here?

00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:03.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Oh, Weird Guy.

00:20:03.485 --> 00:20:04.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well how do you do?

00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:08.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Nagisa
Furukawa of 3-B.

00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:10.460 position:5% line:89% align:start
How do you do?

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Fuko, do you happen to
have any interest in acting?

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Intrest in acting?

00:20:15.332 --> 00:20:17.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] The Drama Club
is recruiting members.

00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:20.405 position:5% line:77% align:start
And you're a sophomore.
You haven't joined a club
yet, have you?

00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:21.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] I'm very busy.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't have time for school
club activities.

00:20:24.243 --> 00:20:25.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh come on,
Fuko, don't say that.

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:28.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not making those things
all day and all night, are you?

00:20:28.615 --> 00:20:32.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do this from morning to night,
right through, right here.

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:34.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You say that, but you
go home, don't you?

00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:37.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
No. I never go home.
I'm always in school.

00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:39.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh!
[Tomoya] Oh that's not possible.

00:20:39.127 --> 00:20:40.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to go home sometime,
you know.

00:20:41.096 --> 00:20:43.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'm not lying!
I don't go home.

00:20:43.132 --> 00:20:45.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm always at school.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
From morning to night?

00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:48.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:49.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't go home at all?

00:20:50.007 --> 00:20:53.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. There's no
reason to go home.

00:20:58.983 --> 00:21:02.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you, by chance, run away
from home?

00:21:02.188 --> 00:21:06.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be honest with you, I can't
really tell you why I'm here.

00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:08.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
On the way home from the school
entrance ceremony,

00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:11.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was almost hit by a car.

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:14.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
And before I knew it I was
here at the school.

00:21:14.503 --> 00:21:15.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hit by a car?

00:21:15.737 --> 00:21:19.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I may ask you, what would
your last name be, Fuko?

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:21.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Ibuki; I'm Fuko Ibuki.

00:21:21.978 --> 00:21:24.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko Ibuki...

00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:27.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miss Ibuki's younger sister?

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:32.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, this girl is someone
who knows my big sister.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh, yeah...

00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:36.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
