[Nagisa] Mr. Koumora would
be advisor to both clubs?

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:11.859 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, we were thinking, I mean,
we watched yesterday's match
with intensity,

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.462 position:5% line:77% align:start
and then after the match the
three of us got together and
talked it over.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:18.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's when we thought our two
clubs could share an advisor.

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think Mr. Koumora would
be opposed to the idea.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.704 position:5% line:89% align:start
If it's all right with you.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:25.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is great, Nagisa!

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:27.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Now we can finally revive
the the Drama Club.

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:29.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Yeah.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's not gonna work.
[Tomoya] What?! Why not?!

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:33.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have everything we need,
don't we?

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:36.716 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] They said that
the school doesn't allow
concurrent advisors.

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:40.151 position:5% line:77% align:start
There's a rule that we can't
have club activities without
an advisor present,

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:45.156 position:5% line:77% align:start
and since Mr. Koumora's already
busy with the Choir Club we
would have to alternate days.

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:47.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you tell them you'd
be okay with that?

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:50.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
I tried, but they... they said
there is no precedent so...

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:53.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
Augh! I swear, the student
council at this school

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
is nothing but a bunch of stuck
up bureaucrats!

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:57.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa!
[Kotomi] Nagisa?!

00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:58.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Nagisa?
[Kyou] Nagisa!

00:00:58.970 --> 00:02:01.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa! What's wrong, Nagisa?

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:39.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for taking care
of her, we appreciate it.

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine, she's our friend
after all.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Her parents seemed really
nice. Didn't they?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.309 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] They said Nagisa will
have to stay home from school
for a while.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm really worried about her.

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if we do get an advisor,
without a manager,

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:57.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Drama Club will have
to go on hiatus.

00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:01.854 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, this is the second
time you've helped Nagisa
out like this.

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:02.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:04.456 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I just...

00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:06.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
I...

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>...didn't do anything.</i>

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:18.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Okazaki, it's morning!

00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:20.371 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're gonna be late.

00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:25.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Okazaki.

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:26.611 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoyo!

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:29.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?!

00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:31.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
I stopped by to wake you up

00:03:31.248 --> 00:03:32.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you won't be late for
school, of course.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But you came all the
way to my house?!

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:37.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's on the way to school, so
it's not like it's any trouble.

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:41.893 position:5% line:77% align:start
Besides, if I can help a friend
make it to class on time then
it's worth it.

00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:45.328 position:5% line:77% align:start
I couldn't tell you yesterday,
so I just stopped by. Did I
really surprise you?

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.398 position:5% line:77% align:start
Damn straight you did! You can't
just barge into someone's house
unannounced!

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:52.769 position:5% line:77% align:start
I did nothing of the sort, I got
permission from your father
before I came in.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:57.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you saying you met my dad?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. What? Is there
something wrong with that?

00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.279 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's nothing.
Forget I mentioned it.

00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:07.117 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Let go of my arm!

00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:09.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] No way, if I let go,
you'll run away.

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:10.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why are you picking on me?

00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:13.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lots of other guys are to school
too, you know!

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah? Like who?

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you want? What do you
want?! [whimpering]

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:20.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Actually I'm just here
at Okazaki's request.

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:21.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I thought you'd like
to share in the joy

00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:24.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
of being woken up by a pretty
girl, that's all.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
He keeps his room
pretty neat, huh?

00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:30.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh. What's this?

00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] [screams] Don't look!
[Tomoyo] Oh a porno mag.

00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:34.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
Leave my stuff alone!

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:36.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, you're a guy,
so it's no surprise.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:39.080 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] I hate you!
[Tomoyo] No need to
be embarrassed.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.750 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Youhei] Shut up! I don't want
to hear it!
[Tomoyo] It's a natural part
of adolescence.

00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:44.685 position:5% line:89% align:start
We made it in time after all.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:45.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
See ya later.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's have lunch together again.
Don't forget, okay?

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow this is pretty
fancy for boxed lunch.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] My sister put it all
together this morning.

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.739 position:5% line:83% align:start
It almost looks too beautiful
to eat, doesn't it?

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mm. It's good.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:11.577 position:5% line:89% align:start
I knew you'd think so.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:14.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
My sister's cooking is in a
class of its own.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here's yours, Botan.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.719 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Eat up.
[Botan] Boi boi!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey come on, you two,
squeeze in closer.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
We need to make room
for the food, you know.

00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:26.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey!
[Kyou] Now that I look at it,

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] you two actually make
a pretty cute couple.

00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:31.264 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Right, Botan?
[Botan] Boi boi!

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:34.167 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Candidate] I swear to you here
and now, that if I am elected
[Tomoya] Future plans?

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.169 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Candidate] Student Council
President, I will double the
[Kyou] Yeah, like what are you
planing to do after graduation?

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.838 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Candidate] offerings on
the school lunch menu!
[Kyou] Oh come on. You're
kidding me, right?

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:42.274 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Candidate] In your daily
battles for food
[Kyou] You're a senior and you
haven't even thought about this?

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:44.176 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Candidate contiues speech]
[Tomoya] Come back to me later.
What about you two?

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:45.944 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Candidate contiues speech]
[Kyou] It might sound
strange but,

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:47.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I was thinking of
becoming a kindergarten teacher

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] As for me, I was
considering nursing school.

00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:52.449 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later! Thanks for lunch.

00:05:54.152 --> 00:05:57.354 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't forget, tomorrow it's
Ryou's turn to make lunch
for us.

00:05:57.454 --> 00:05:58.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
So look forward to it, okay?

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you doing just
standing there?

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:01.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and follow him.

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.495 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Hey, are you sure
about this?
[KYou] About what?

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:08.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I don't know, I just...
I feel bad for Nagisa.

00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:12.602 position:5% line:77% align:start
Listen, Tomoya said himself that
he and Nagisa weren't going
out or anything.

00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:16.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no reason for you
to hold back.

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:20.910 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you keep hesitating like that
you're gonna end up losing him
to that Tomoyo girl.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay with that?

00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:28.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
[school bell rings]

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:30.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
I gotta go. See ya.

00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:32.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Kyou, I...

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:38.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] I'm sorry.

00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
So Nagisa couldn't make it, huh?

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:45.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Feels lonely without her.

00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:48.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're gonna go visit her
today, right?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me come along too.

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:51.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
She might not want
me there everyday.

00:06:51.572 --> 00:06:52.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to wear
out my welcome.

00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:55.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd rather just give her some
time to rest.

00:06:55.576 --> 00:07:00.282 position:5% line:77% align:start
Okazaki, tell me the truth, do
you and Nagisa have a thing
going on or not?

00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:01.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
How many times do I have
to tell you?

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not looking for
a girlfriend.

00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:04.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh? Why not?

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
[both] Ah!

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait. Why not what?

00:07:07.487 --> 00:07:09.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you want a girlfriend?
Of course.

00:07:09.323 --> 00:07:12.525 position:5% line:77% align:start
You don't make a decision
like that unless you have
a good reason.

00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:14.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should know.
You've seen my dad.

00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:16.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm a good-for-nothing
delinquent and on top of that

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
my home situation
is a total mess.

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
As things are now, I'm not fit
to have a girlfriend.

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:25.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you say so, but your dad
looked nice to me.

00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:28.308 position:5% line:77% align:start
Whatever, now that we've met
up, we might as well walk
home together.

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:31.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't trust me to walk
home by myself?!

00:07:31.344 --> 00:07:32.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sounds great! Let me tag
along too.

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I don't remember
inviting you.

00:07:35.282 --> 00:07:39.286 position:5% line:77% align:start
I hate to break it to you, but
when you invite Okazaki,
you invite me too.

00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:42.788 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] I have to make a stop
on the way back, so keep me
company, okay?

00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:46.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
Damnit! She beat
us to it this time!

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why'd you have to come
to a place like this?

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:54.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
[quietly] You'll find out
soon enough.

00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:56.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
[boys laughing]

00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:59.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
It gets better.

00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:00.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! Sakagami?!

00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:02.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Delinquent 2] What are you
doing here?!

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Delinquent 3] Oh damn, run!

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:06.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Well now you know.
They hate me here.

00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:08.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
They all treat me like some
kind of monster.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.351 position:5% line:77% align:start
So the rumors that you use to
beat up troublemakers turned
out to be true after all.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
That was ages ago.

00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:17.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Delinquen 5] Oh no!
It's Sakagami!

00:08:19.723 --> 00:08:22.126 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei chuckles quietly]

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:23.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
[quietly] That was
a dirty trick.

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:25.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
[quietly] Those guys are always
harassing me.

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't let this chance go
to waste. That was great!

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:29.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was totally worth it.

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:31.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, will you hurry
and finish up

00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:34.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
whatever you need to do here?
I'm ready to leave to now.

00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:36.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually this isn't the place
we needed to go,

00:08:36.406 --> 00:08:39.343 position:5% line:77% align:start
we just happened to pass
through here on the way
to someplace else.

00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:41.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Huh?!
[Tomoya] Keep your mouth shut.

00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:43.646 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just play along or I'll tell her
why you really dragged
her out here.

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:45.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anything but that!

00:08:46.383 --> 00:08:49.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see, so you just wanted to
come to this coffee shop?

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:51.954 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] And guess what?
All of this is Sunohara's treat.

00:08:52.054 --> 00:08:53.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
See? He's not such a bad
friend after all.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.427 position:5% line:77% align:start
Mhm! And from now on, you
can consider me a friend
too. Okay, Sunohara?

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:00.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it would be my pleasure.

00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:04.133 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, it's always been
his dream to bring a girl
to this place.

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:05.800 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Really?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Thanks for earlier.

00:09:07.203 --> 00:09:08.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] For what?

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:09.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You knew I didn't want
to stay there,

00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:11.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you said something
to bail me out, right?

00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:15.677 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Not really, I wasn't
too keen on staying
there myself.

00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:18.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Okazaki...

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.950 position:5% line:77% align:start
Unlike before, I've made a lot
of good friends at school
this year.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
And today, I really enjoyed
being with you and Sunohara too.

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:28.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or rather, I really enjoyed
being with you, I mean.

00:09:28.822 --> 00:09:30.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
Glad I didn't dissapoint.

00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:32.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] See you tomorrow.

00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:49.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Okazaki.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.279 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] [sleepy groan] Hi...
[Tomoyo] Looks like you're
still half-asleep.

00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:53.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're making a pretty
funny face.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know. How about I do this and
make it even funnier?

00:09:58.151 --> 00:09:59.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What the hell
are you doing?!

00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:01.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm waking you up.
You should be grateful.

00:10:01.888 --> 00:10:04.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't tell me you plan
on doing this every day?

00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:06.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course. Aren't you happy?

00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:09.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
To tell you the truth,
it's more of an imposition.

00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:12.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, no need to be shy.
We're all friends here.

00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:16.068 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] I wasn't planning on
coming but Okazaki insisted
that I wake you too.

00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:17.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope you're grateful.

00:10:17.503 --> 00:10:19.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] And underclassman wakes
an upperclassman from his

00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:22.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
peacefull slumber and
expects gratitude for it?!

00:10:22.274 --> 00:10:24.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're a real stickler for
social ranking, huh?

00:10:24.743 --> 00:10:28.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
You think some half assed
apology will get you off, huh?

00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:30.348 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Who said I was
apologizing?

00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:35.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, up close, you've got a
pretty nice body. I can dig it.

00:10:35.253 --> 00:10:38.457 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] This guy's doomed</i>
 <i>to be the sidekick for the rest</i>
 <i>of his life.</i>

00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:41.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you're interested in my
body, are you?

00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:44.295 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you beg me on your hands and
knees, then maybe I'll let you
touch me.

00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.397 position:5% line:89% align:start
For real?!

00:10:46.497 --> 00:10:47.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what's it gonna be?

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:48.865 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I'm begging you!

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] That's too pathetic.

00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:53.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good boy. Now get your reward.

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:58.942 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] What's this?
[Tomoyo] The hand's an important
part of the body, right?

00:10:59.042 --> 00:11:02.979 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Alright! That's it
you've pissed me off for
the last time!

00:11:04.848 --> 00:11:06.682 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I'm gonna die!

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.755 position:5% line:77% align:start
Is it just me, or did he say
something while I was
kicking him?

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:15.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
He said, "Awesome."

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
I should have known.
What a freak.

00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:24.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
Boi boi!

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:25.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow. You actually came.

00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:27.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah of course. I promised,
didn't I?

00:11:28.036 --> 00:11:30.671 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou clears her throat]
[Ryou] I made the boxed
lunchs for us today.

00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:33.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, of course Kyou gave
me some pointers.

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:36.512 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] She really outdid
herself, so savor the
flavor, okay?

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll do my best. Anyway,
I appreciate it.

00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:42.817 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Botan] Boi!
[Kyou] Hey, Botan, watch
your manners!

00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:46.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Botan] Boi!

00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:54.562 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] I'm sorry. I should have
tasted it first. I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:11:54.661 --> 00:11:58.466 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey don't worry about it. If
nothing else I thought the
spring rolls were great.

00:11:58.566 --> 00:12:01.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you really mean it?
I was so worried.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
Poi!

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness you're all right.

00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:07.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well guys, I'm going
to the front gate

00:12:07.407 --> 00:12:08.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
to take Botan outside. See ya!

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Kyou, wait!

00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:16.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Is something
troubling you?

00:13:18.108 --> 00:13:21.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I don't know if I would
say "troubling".

00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:24.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just the other day I was reading
a spell book that has just the

00:13:24.113 --> 00:13:25.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
solution you might be
looking for.

00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:27.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
Would you like to try it?

00:13:28.818 --> 00:13:30.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
There. Got it. What's next?

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:34.056 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yukine] Let's see. Now you put
another ten-yen coin on top of
that one.

00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:35.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding? There's no way.

00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:39.528 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yukine] The book says you have
to, otherwise the spell
won't work.

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:44.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? I did it!

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:45.900 position:5% line:89% align:start
After stacked all the coins,

00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:49.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
chant "Bita funi kousoku iita"
three times.

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:51.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Bita funi kousoku iita.

00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:53.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
Bita funi kousoku iita.

00:13:53.508 --> 00:13:56.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
Bita funi kousoku iita.

00:13:56.177 --> 00:13:58.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this supose to do anyway?

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.082 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yukine] It's a spell to be
locked in the gym storage
with a girl,

00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:02.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
just the two of you that is.

00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:05.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
Think of someone and it will
come true.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:09.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I would say Nagisa but she's</i>
 <i>absent so that won't work.</i>

00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:10.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Kyou?</i>

00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:13.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I guess Kyou would be okay.</i>

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.998 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatever. It's not like this
is for real or anything.

00:14:18.098 --> 00:14:21.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you change your mind, there's
a way to break the spell.

00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:23.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is take off
your shirt and chant

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:27.374 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Noroi nante henoheno kappa"
three times.

00:14:27.474 --> 00:14:29.008 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Not interested.

00:14:29.108 --> 00:14:30.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, you've got all
these books,

00:14:30.377 --> 00:14:31.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
can't you teach me
something useful?

00:14:31.978 --> 00:14:34.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd be more than happy to
give a bit of advice,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
but you have to tell me what
your problem is first.

00:14:38.117 --> 00:14:41.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
When you put it that way
I'm not sure where to start.

00:14:41.487 --> 00:14:42.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I know...

00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:44.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you think about our
student council?

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.259 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] I think they're very
devoted to their work,

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:49.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
but as a result I feel they can
be a bit unreasonable at times.

00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:53.298 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, I agree, I don't
see why they can't approve this
whole advisor thing.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:56.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
But on the bright side, the
policies will probably change

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
once the new officers
are chosen.

00:14:58.771 --> 00:15:01.673 position:5% line:77% align:start
The student council elections
are right around the corner,
you know.

00:15:01.774 --> 00:15:03.642 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right! The elections!

00:15:03.742 --> 00:15:07.179 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>That's right! If Tomoyo is</i>
 <i>elected as student council</i>
 <i>president</i>

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>the problem will be solved.</i>

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:11.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Come on Nagisa, get well soon.</i>

00:15:11.148 --> 00:15:12.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I've got good news for you!</i>

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Ah, Tomoya!

00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:19.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
Grab that ball for me,
will you?

00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:23.060 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] P.E. class ran long
today, so the other students
took off in a hurry.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since they're all gone it's my
job to clean up.

00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:27.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's fine, but why
do I have to help?

00:15:27.164 --> 00:15:29.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] This is the least you can
do. You shouldn't complain to

00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:31.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
the girl who feeds you everyday.

00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:35.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like someone left the
storage room open.

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:39.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] H-Hey!

00:15:39.876 --> 00:15:40.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What's wrong?

00:15:40.811 --> 00:15:41.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
The door won't open.

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:43.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
It locks automaticaly when
you close it.

00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:45.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
So we're stuck.

00:15:45.448 --> 00:15:46.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Forgive me!

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:48.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you apologizing for?

00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:51.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Did you plan this?!

00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:52.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the big idea?

00:15:52.856 --> 00:15:54.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
L-Listen, you better not try
anything funny!

00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:55.759 position:5% line:89% align:start
You hear me?

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:57.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you're
saying that!

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-Hey!

00:16:03.132 --> 00:16:05.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] We can't!
How can I put this?

00:16:05.334 --> 00:16:08.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
I- I mean, it's not like we're
even going out or anything.

00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:10.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
Besides, what about Ryou?

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:13.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just stop right there! Listen!

00:16:13.475 --> 00:16:16.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, just think this over for
a second. I know you're a guy,

00:16:16.612 --> 00:16:18.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you probably want to do these
kinds of things,

00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:23.117 position:5% line:77% align:start
but you can't just force
yourself on someone, the
feelings have to be mutual,

00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:24.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I- I can't betray Ryou.

00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:26.822 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said hold on, damnit!

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:30.291 position:5% line:77% align:start
This was an accident! I didn't
think that stupid spell would
actually work!

00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:34.060 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Kyou] Huh?
[Tomoya] I'm talking about the
spell that locked the two of us
in the gym!

00:16:34.162 --> 00:16:35.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
It really worked!

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:37.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't look at me like
I'm crazy!

00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:40.967 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Even if it did work, who
would come up with such a
ridiculous spell?!

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't ask me, I feel the
same way!

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:45.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec, why would you pick
me to be locked up with?

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:47.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You just came to mind.
I wasn't thinking!

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see, so what you're saying is,

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:56.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you had to be locked up with
someone, I'm your first choice?

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Damn, I don't like</i>
 <i>where this is headed.</i>

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:03.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
You must know.
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:06.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why I keep inviting you to have
lunch with Ryou, I mean.

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not just cause I want
to hang out.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.129 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, I have an idea.

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.997 position:5% line:89% align:start
And yet you still chose me.

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, but I didn't mean
it like that.

00:17:29.447 --> 00:17:31.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Don't just stand there.</i>
 <i>Say something!</i>

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I didn't mean anything by</i>
 <i>picking you, I promise!</i>

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:38.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya, would you rather
Ryou just leave you alone?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] N-No, I wouldn't
say that.

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:43.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, in that case...

00:17:43.293 --> 00:17:44.696 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's it!
[Kyou] What is it?!

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't think about anything else,

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
just leave this to me!

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, wait!
Y-You aren't serious?!

00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:51.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm dead serious!
I don't need to think this over!

00:17:51.168 --> 00:17:54.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what about Ryou? And
besides, I- I really don't know

00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:55.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
how this kind of stuff works.

00:17:55.806 --> 00:17:57.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is my first time.

00:17:57.341 --> 00:17:58.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's my first time too,

00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:00.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
but leave everything to me.

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:04.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
D- Don't give me such a
serious look, I... I...

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
Turn around for a sec. I need to
take off my shirt, 'kay?

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:08.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, okay.

00:18:10.052 --> 00:18:11.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
Noroi nante henoheno kappa.

00:18:12.054 --> 00:18:13.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
Noroi nante henoheno kappa.

00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:16.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
Noroi nante henoheno kappa!

00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:23.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyou, are you in here?

00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:25.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
The teacher's been calling
for you.

00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:27.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait. What are you doing?

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Um... nothing...

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, I'm glad
we finally got out.

00:18:34.276 --> 00:18:36.378 position:5% line:83% align:start
[nervous laugh] To tell
you the truth,

00:18:36.478 --> 00:18:38.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was starting to get
worried there for a second.

00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:42.817 position:5% line:77% align:start
But anyway, I'm really sorry.
I guess I was starting to act
a little strange in there.

00:18:44.286 --> 00:18:46.288 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's pretend this never
happened, okay?

00:18:46.388 --> 00:18:48.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, don't feel bad. I'm the
one to blame here.

00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:50.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Girl] Kyou!

00:18:50.224 --> 00:18:51.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess I better get going.

00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:52.627 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll see you tomorrow!

00:18:52.727 --> 00:18:54.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
See ya.

00:18:55.964 --> 00:18:56.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Okazaki!

00:18:57.097 --> 00:18:58.799 position:5% line:89% align:start
Want to walk home together?

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
You didn't have to look so
surprised, it was just me.

00:19:02.037 --> 00:19:03.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to ask you...

00:19:03.537 --> 00:19:05.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
How's the big campaign for
student council coming along?

00:19:05.138 --> 00:19:07.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why are you so curious suddenly?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, if you were elected
studen council president,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was hoping I could
ask you for a favor.

00:19:14.113 --> 00:19:16.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:17.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] The guys from before!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Delinquent 1] Just 'cause you
took us out before,

00:19:19.352 --> 00:19:21.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
doesn't give you the right to
come struting around our turf.

00:19:21.521 --> 00:19:24.290 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Delinquent 2] But if you're
looking for a fight, then
you've got one!

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, you better stay back.

00:19:26.192 --> 00:19:28.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
No way! If you get in a fight,
in front of the school

00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:30.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'll blow your chances
in the election.

00:19:30.897 --> 00:19:32.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoyo don't!

00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:34.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't reason with
these people.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:40.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko has arrived!

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.681 position:5% line:77% align:start
Finally, the time has come to
unleash the invincible power
of the starfish heat!

00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:52.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ready? Starfish Heat!

00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:55.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
Prepare yourself, for I,
the great Fuko,

00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:59.390 position:5% line:77% align:start
have hidden adorable little
starfish wood carvings all
throughout the school.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.427 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now, now, I made more than
enough for everyone so there's
no need to panic just yet.

00:20:03.527 --> 00:20:09.166 position:5% line:77% align:start
However, the truly devoted
starfish collectors had better
be prepared to search hard.

00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:13.336 position:5% line:77% align:start
The starfish carvings with my
autograph are especially
well hidden.

00:20:13.437 --> 00:20:16.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
That being said,
Starfish Heat, go!

00:20:16.641 --> 00:20:19.844 position:5% line:77% align:start
You see, now their minds will
be filled with the thoughts
of the starfish.

00:20:19.944 --> 00:20:23.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
They'll be so obsessed with
finding them that they'll
forget all about you!

00:20:23.313 --> 00:20:25.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh?! They don't want the
starfish at all?

00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:27.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
The plan failed?!

00:20:27.484 --> 00:20:30.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, um, is it okay
if I leave now?

00:20:30.587 --> 00:20:31.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go ahead.

00:20:31.554 --> 00:20:32.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:35.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
What was that all about?

00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:37.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
Feels like I've seen her
somewhere before.

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:42.132 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Wow. In a situation
this desperate, even a cat's
help would be welcome.

00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:43.967 position:5% line:89% align:start
Desperate enough for a cat, huh?

00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:45.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually I'd perfer the
cat to him.

00:20:45.969 --> 00:20:50.572 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't say that, after all,
yesterday's rival can become
tomorrow's friend.

00:20:50.673 --> 00:20:53.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, you're more like a
punching bag than a rival.

00:20:53.242 --> 00:20:55.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, I hold my own against
Tomoyo!

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:57.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Okay fine, so what
were you saying?

00:20:57.378 --> 00:20:59.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
As I was saying,
Tomoyo and I may be

00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:02.017 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Youhei] bitter rivals most
of the time.
[Tomoya] Yeah we got that part,
now hurry up and to the point.

00:21:02.117 --> 00:21:05.787 position:5% line:77% align:start
but when a challenger comes
from another school, we become
comrades in arms!

00:21:05.888 --> 00:21:07.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll just get in the way.

00:21:07.188 --> 00:21:09.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
I promise I won't be a burden
just humor me!

00:21:09.524 --> 00:21:12.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you assholes want to fight
or just do comedy all day?!

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
Screw this! Let's murder
those punks!

00:21:13.895 --> 00:21:16.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Delinquents] Yeah!

00:21:16.898 --> 00:21:17.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
Crap! Leave the rest to me!

00:21:23.671 --> 00:21:26.373 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm on your side, remember?

00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:30.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't tell you
apart. Sorry!

00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:33.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's so hardcore she even beats
up her friends!

00:21:33.213 --> 00:21:35.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is looking bad.
We better bail!

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoyo!

00:21:39.318 --> 00:21:41.353 position:5% line:89% align:start
HEEEEEY!

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:44.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh crap! Run away!

00:21:46.193 --> 00:21:48.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Oogami] What the hell's
going on here?!

00:21:52.298 --> 00:21:55.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, you again, huh?

00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:56.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
No sir, the truth is I'm...

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:58.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's right,
I'm the one who started it!

00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:01.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
The girl there had nothing
at all to do with this.

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:03.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
You got a bad record already.

00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:05.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
This time you'll probably
be suspended.

00:22:05.477 --> 00:22:06.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
Be prepared for that!

00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:10.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki...

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] I see, so he took the
blame for Sakagami and was
suspended.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.911 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Kyou] Morning, Tomoya! We
thought you might appreciate
a little snack.
[Botan] Boi boi!

00:23:51.011 --> 00:23:55.448 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] I thought Tomoya must
be hungry with no one to cook
for him.

00:23:55.548 --> 00:23:57.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make up your mind already.

00:23:57.184 --> 00:24:00.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a second, are you telling
me that was the only reason

00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:04.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
you transferred to this school?

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
This place holds special
memories for me.

00:24:07.827 --> 00:24:09.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why I have to protect it.
