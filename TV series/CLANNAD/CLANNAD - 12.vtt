00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:07.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Thank you for letting
me use the violin.

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:10.420 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] And we're terribly
sorry that we kept it for
a whole week.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.324 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well actually, this isn't
officially school property,
you see.

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
A student who graduated
several years ago

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
left it behind when
she went to college.

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:22.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rie] The music teacher
asked me to test it

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
and see if it plays properly.

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:28.638 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a very old
violin after all.

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
It may be an old violin,

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I can see that the strings
are a little worn,

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:36.413 position:5% line:83% align:start
and the wood does look
a little warped to me,

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:40.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I still think it's
a wonderful violin.

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:43.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] So, please don't
throw it away.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:47.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yes, that's what I intend
to tell the teacher.

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a relief!

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:52.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, there's
something I forgot.

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:55.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why hello there. How do you do?

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Kotomi Ichinose of 3-A.

00:00:58.568 --> 00:00:59.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love reading.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you and I could be friends,
I would be so very happy.

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:06.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I'm not mistaken,
she's been introduced already,

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:09.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
but let's just clarify who
you are, shall we?

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes, my name
is Rie Nishina.

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm very happy to meet
both of you.

00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:18.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll see you again.

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:20.190 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, see you around.

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:26.630 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Looks like you're
making lots of friends here.
[Kotomi] Uh-huh...

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.534 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Sure would be nice
if you keep meeting people
like this.
[Kotomi] Uh-huh...

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:10.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi doesn't go to the
library anymore these days.

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
Instead,
she's attending classes.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, how about we go
take a little peek?

00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] Say, Ichinose,

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:20.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
about problem three here...

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] This is
x = cos (theta),

00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:27.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
and when you solve it,
then the result is pie/ 9.

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:29.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl] So, that's it!
Thank you!

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:31.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh my goodness, Ichinose,
you're so smart!

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:35.927 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kay] I just realized!
That was you performing
at the violin concert!

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:37.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
That was amazing!

00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:39.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl] What?
You play the violin?

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:41.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should've told us!
We'd have gone to see you.

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:46.938 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kay] Well, I passed by, and
I don't know whether you could
really call that playing.

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:48.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that, Kay?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kay] Almost like,
"Never mind, I'll play!"

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:52.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] I have to say,
it's a little bit embarrassing.

00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] You're too naive!

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:04.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
The world of comedy doesn't
tolerate anyone who is sub par!

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why you can
see the rejects

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:09.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
with their silly neckties
far beyond the horizon!

00:04:09.494 --> 00:04:12.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, if you flub your lines
or sound unnatural...

00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:14.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you know what will happen?

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:16.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
What will happen?

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:19.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Why? Are you stupid?!

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:19.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eep!

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Snap out of it!

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:21.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
Out of what?

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:23.508 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, just forget it!

00:04:23.608 --> 00:04:25.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't you see?!

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.715 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't you see that everyone
will attack you with severe
backhand chops?!

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:33.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's just how things
are in the real world!

00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:35.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think retorts can
be very scary.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
In any case,

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
even if you're reborn
a million times,

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
you won't make it as a comedian.

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:43.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
S-Sister, that's a bit too
harsh, don't you think?

00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:47.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
I agree! I mean, if we all work
together, then I'm sure...

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.433 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] It's useless!

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:50.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter how many
zeros you have,

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:51.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
they always add up to zero.
[whimpering]

00:04:52.038 --> 00:04:54.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're being really mean
to those girls, you know that?

00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:58.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believe this calls
for a last resort.

00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:01.279 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to have to deliver
an amazing gag!

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can only hope it's not
another moldy old joke of yours.

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just learned it on television.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] It's very fresh.

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:14.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, here I go.

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:20.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
This bends like this.

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
[snrk]
[giggling]

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.971 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's a gag?

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:27.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look, don't ask me.

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:29.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
And then this part comes off.

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:30.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
It is a gag!

00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:33.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't cry!

00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:34.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
[all] Wow!

00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.716 position:5% line:89% align:start
You made so much food for us.

00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:39.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] That's because I wanted
everyone to have some.

00:05:40.087 --> 00:05:43.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, Kotomi, what do you
do when there's no school?

00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:46.026 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I always read
all of my books.

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:49.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
And me, I usually just hang
around at Sunohara's place.

00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:52.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just basically stay
at home too.

00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:54.134 position:5% line:89% align:start
How hopeless!

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
Every one of us are
at the peak of our youth,

00:05:56.435 --> 00:06:00.473 position:5% line:77% align:start
and all of you are doing nothing
but wasting away your time
and bodies!

00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:02.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you're saying you have
a lot of things to do?

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:04.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Not a thing!
[Tomoya] Figured as much.

00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:07.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
But just now, I came up
with a really good plan.

00:06:07.546 --> 00:06:11.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone, meet at 9 AM tomorrow
in front of the station!

00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:14.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] We have a group date!
A really, really exciting
group activity!

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.390 position:5% line:77% align:start
It will be the perfect symbol
of our innocent and
proper youth!

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm the only guy?

00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:30.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara would have
come if you asked.

00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:33.073 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] I rejected him!

00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:34.574 position:5% line:89% align:start
One fool is plenty enough.

00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:37.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Fool?
You talking about yourself?

00:06:37.177 --> 00:06:39.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Don't make me laugh.

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:40.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean you, who else?

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:41.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh really?

00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:44.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, you're a pretty
big fool yourself.

00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:49.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Kyou, Kotomi's birthday's
is coming up soon.

00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:51.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Yes, this Saturday.

00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:55.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] All right! I'll think of
the perfect birthday present!

00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:02.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
Rrr...

00:07:06.506 --> 00:07:07.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>No way!</i>

00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, it didn't even
budge an inch!

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:13.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, you there! The position
of this machine is all wrong!

00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:14.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
No one has a chance with this!

00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:16.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
[clerk] Not again?

00:07:16.117 --> 00:07:17.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you give
it up already?

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:18.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
[onlooker] She's gonna
try again?!

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:19.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>This is what she meant</i>

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>by the "perfect present"?</i>

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:24.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've never seen a stuffed
animal that's that enormous.

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:29.462 position:5% line:77% align:start
Could it be possible that the
stuffed version is bigger than
the real animal?

00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:31.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
[clerk] Here you go.

00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:32.799 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, this will be my 34th
consecutive attempt at success!

00:07:36.304 --> 00:07:38.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, listen to me,
this is your last try!

00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:40.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've cleaned me out.
I'm flat broke.

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:42.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Next is your turn, Ryou!

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:44.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, no! I have no confidence.

00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:45.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
I failed last time.

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Then you, Nagisa!

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, ask someone else,

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:52.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
because I'll just be a waste
of Okazaki's hard-earned money.

00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:54.421 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, then,
maybe you should-
[Kyou] You're so hopeless!

00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:58.693 position:5% line:77% align:start
Isn't there anyone brave enough
to step forward and say,
"I can do it"?

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:04.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko-chan at your service!

00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:11.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Okay, who are you?

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:12.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
You seemed to be
having difficulties,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.409 position:5% line:77% align:start
so I have rushed here with
the sole purpose of being
of service.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please leave this to Fuko!

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:21.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, haven't you and
I met somewhere before?

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:24.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it.
You don't have to remember now.

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:27.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day is sure to come
when we cross paths again.

00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:29.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute,
are you sure about this?

00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:31.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
In my neighborhood, people say

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:34.795 position:5% line:77% align:start
that if you put me in a
crane, there isn't a thing
I can't grab.

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:37.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am a certifiable master
at this little carnival game.

00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:39.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
What kind of neighborhood
is that?

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:43.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait, I've had this
conversation before...

00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:45.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
The one you're after
is that big one right there.

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:47.008 position:5% line:89% align:start
Understand?

00:08:47.808 --> 00:08:48.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is it!

00:08:48.643 --> 00:08:50.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Here I go!

00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:52.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.330 position:5% line:77% align:start
My hand moved on its own,
drawn by the shape of this
precious object.

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:12.466 position:5% line:77% align:start
Alright, you are aware that
that is a star, not a starfish,
aren't you?

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:15.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I wasn't able to be
of service this time,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I would like to appear
again one day!

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:19.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well then...

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who was that girl?

00:09:24.012 --> 00:09:27.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
And why did I say
it was a starfish?

00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:28.750 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder...

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:32.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
And after all that,
we ended up with no present.

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:34.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] There's still time
to try again.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's just put a little
more thought into it.

00:09:37.192 --> 00:09:39.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! A vapor trail!

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:41.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, it's so pretty.

00:09:43.665 --> 00:09:45.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, what's the matter
with you, Kotomi?

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:54.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] We're going
to go this way.

00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:58.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Nagisa, Kyo, Ryou,
see you tomorrow.

00:09:58.513 --> 00:10:00.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Goodnight.
[Ryou] Yes.

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:02.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Bye-bye.

00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you so very much, Tomoya.

00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:10.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I had never met you,

00:10:10.993 --> 00:10:15.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would never have felt this
much joy with wonderful people.

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:20.203 position:5% line:77% align:start
I didn't do anything. It was all
Nagisa, Kyou, and Fujibayashi's
idea to go out together.

00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:21.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
They really like you.

00:10:21.703 --> 00:10:23.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] That's all.

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:27.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's true, then
I'm a really happy girl.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:30.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen, Tomoya,

00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:33.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's a little something
that I would like you to have.

00:10:35.084 --> 00:10:38.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
I honestly think you would
really like it.

00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:42.657 position:5% line:77% align:start
You can have it, because I have
already memorized everything
that's in there.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, what? Do you want
me to read it or something?

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:52.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, you don't have
to read it.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Just hang on to
it for a while for me.

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:57.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:10:57.773 --> 00:10:59.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:03.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait a minute,
isn't that the guy?

00:11:03.212 --> 00:11:04.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the bad man...

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:05.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-Hey!

00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:18.895 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] He's gone.

00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:21.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just who is that guy anyway?

00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:23.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] And what does
he want with you?

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:34.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:57.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
[yawn]

00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:01.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>I've been having</i>
 <i>some bad dreams lately.</i>

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:03.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Tomoya, guess who!

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh- Hey, wait a minute!

00:12:07.444 --> 00:12:09.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can feel your boobs!

00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:12.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Icanfeelyourboobs?
Yourboobs?

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:14.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stop talking like
a Russian gymnast!

00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:15.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi, you're standing
so close to me

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.423 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I can feel your boobs
are pressed against my back!

00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:20.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Oh.
[Tomoya] Ah!

00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:24.228 position:5% line:89% align:start
My heart is beating so fast!

00:12:24.328 --> 00:12:27.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whose the weirdo who put you
up to this embarrassing trick?!

00:12:27.498 --> 00:12:29.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid I did!

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:30.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well stop it, will you?

00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:31.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
Quit making Kotomi
do such sick tricks!

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:32.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's a sweet girl.

00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:33.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with it?

00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:35.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not going to make
them smaller.

00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:37.107 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Kyou!
[Kyou] Huh?

00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:41.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's up, Nagisa,
where's the fire?

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:46.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kyou, Ryou commutes to school
by taking the bus, doesn't she?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
Every day. So, why do you
want to know so bad?

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:52.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, Ryou's always on the
bus around this time, isn't she?

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.260 position:5% line:77% align:start
What's wrong? Why do you want
to know about Ryou's method
of transport?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's been a bus accident
over at the intersection,

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:02.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
and a crowd has gathered
to see the carnage!

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:05.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems like
a serious accident.

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:06.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] What if Ryou...

00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:09.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no way!
That's just not possible!

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.178 position:5% line:77% align:start
There's no way I wouldn't
sense it if something happened
to my own sister!

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:15.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kyou!

00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:26.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
[boy] Oh man! I've never seen
a bus turned over like that!

00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:28.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] It's a bad intersection...

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:31.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
There could be a lot of
casualties in this one.

00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:32.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:32.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ryou!

00:13:32.863 --> 00:13:34.031 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Sis?

00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:36.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Ryou!

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:38.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fujibayashi, you're all right?!
Are you hurt at all?

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, Ryou, weren't
you on that bus this morning?

00:13:41.606 --> 00:13:43.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I took the next one.

00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:45.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
The roads were really crowded,

00:13:45.142 --> 00:13:48.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
so crowded that I was late
getting to the bus stop on time.

00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:50.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] That bus
wasn't in service,

00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:52.983 position:5% line:89% align:start
so there were no passengers.

00:13:53.084 --> 00:13:57.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bus driver and the driver
of the other car are over there.

00:13:57.589 --> 00:14:00.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the one that went through
the light, you blind nitwit!

00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:03.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was yellow, so I just
stepped on it a little!

00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:04.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's your fault for not looking!

00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:07.432 position:5% line:77% align:start
[policeman] Okay, okay,
that's enough. I'll hear
you out over there.

00:14:07.532 --> 00:14:11.802 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm just so happy that no
one was hurt in the terrible
bus accident!

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:13.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
[relieved sigh]

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.175 position:5% line:89% align:start
I-It's okay, sister...

00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:20.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry that I over-reacted
to the situation, Kyou.

00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:23.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm just relieved that
no one was hurt at least.

00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:24.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:28.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, are you okay?

00:14:28.753 --> 00:14:31.522 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Kotomi, Ryou is okay.

00:14:31.623 --> 00:14:33.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
[whimpering]
[Nagisa] Isn't that great?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi?

00:14:40.098 --> 00:14:41.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi?

00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:46.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
[panic]

00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:49.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
[wailing]

00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:57.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
[hurried footsteps]

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:58.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Kotomi!
[Kyou] Kotomi?

00:14:58.783 --> 00:14:59.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter with you?

00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:02.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kotomi! Kotomi, hey!

00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:04.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] I'll be good...

00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:08.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be a good girl...
I'll be good, I will!

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Kotomi!

00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:12.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Kotomi, don't cry!

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:14.098 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] The hospital!
An ambulance!

00:15:14.198 --> 00:15:16.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
L-Let's take her
to the infirmary!

00:15:18.437 --> 00:15:19.371 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean she left?

00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:21.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, apparently,
she left all by herself

00:15:21.906 --> 00:15:23.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
in the middle
of the first period.

00:15:23.642 --> 00:15:27.045 position:5% line:77% align:start
At least that's what the
physician on call said
at the infirmary.

00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:29.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was suffering so much,
do you guys really think

00:15:29.315 --> 00:15:31.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
that it's okay to leave
her alone, like that?

00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:34.653 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's what we were worried
about, so we asked him the
same thing.

00:15:34.753 --> 00:15:36.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] But he said
it's a personal matter,

00:15:36.522 --> 00:15:39.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
and wasn't able to tell
us any more than that.

00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:42.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something personal, eh?

00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:44.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think we should go to
the teachers' office.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
The teacher in charge should
know what happened to her.

00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:50.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
[teacher] She came
to tell me herself...

00:15:50.235 --> 00:15:52.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
She wasn't feeling well,
so she wanted to leave

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:53.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
and to go home alone.

00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:56.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
But exactly what happened
to Ichinose?

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:58.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is this personal
matter of hers?

00:15:58.644 --> 00:16:01.146 position:5% line:83% align:start
[teacher] Well, I can't tell
you because it's private.

00:16:01.246 --> 00:16:04.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should wait until she's
ready to tell you herself.

00:16:04.183 --> 00:16:08.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't mean to pry, but do
you think it would okay for
us to visit her at home?

00:16:08.722 --> 00:16:10.790 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should
let her be for now.

00:16:10.889 --> 00:16:12.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I'll give you her address.

00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:16.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just don't force
yourself on her.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
[teacher] Here you go.

00:16:20.933 --> 00:16:25.037 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Kotomi thought I had
been seriously hurt and
went into shock.

00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:26.573 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is all my fault!

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:29.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't blurted out that
there had been an accident...

00:16:29.308 --> 00:16:31.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What happened today
was no one's fault.

00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:32.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:16:32.812 --> 00:16:34.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you serious? Really?

00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:37.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe all of us haven't really

00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:39.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
become friends yet.

00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:47.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] She's not home?

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:51.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or maybe she could
just be resting in bed.

00:16:52.097 --> 00:16:54.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't we call it a day
and come back tomorrow?

00:16:55.901 --> 00:16:58.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki?

00:16:58.338 --> 00:17:00.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki, is something
the matter?

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:01.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's nothing.

00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:11.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.552 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what is it, Nagisa?

00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:16.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems like you've been
in a daze since earlier today.

00:17:16.756 --> 00:17:17.956 position:5% line:89% align:start
That house we saw today...

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:21.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel there's something
familiar about it,

00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:23.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I can't figure out
what it is.

00:17:23.229 --> 00:17:24.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's strange...

00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:27.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter with you?

00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:28.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
You guys just go on home

00:17:29.035 --> 00:17:30.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I'll see you tomorrow.

00:17:30.103 --> 00:17:32.038 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Hey, wait up!

00:17:40.613 --> 00:17:43.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, you! What're you doing
sneaking around like this?!

00:17:43.183 --> 00:17:44.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're that boy who was with-

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of business

00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:47.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
do you have with this house?

00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:48.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look kid, I'm sorry.

00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:51.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess that my behavior
is bound to arouse

00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:53.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
more than a little suspicion
around here.

00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:56.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] I rang the bell,
but no one answered.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I went around the back
and was looking around.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
So tell me who you are exactly.

00:18:02.937 --> 00:18:06.206 position:5% line:77% align:start
Actually, I'm just an old
work acquaintance of
Kotomi's parents.

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:09.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was one of the members
of their science research team.

00:18:09.242 --> 00:18:12.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I've known Kotomi Ichinose
ever since she was little.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec, are you saying you
came to see Kotomi's parents?

00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, I see.

00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:19.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you must not be aware of it.

00:18:19.854 --> 00:18:22.456 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Wait?
[man] Well, if she hasn't
told you about it,

00:18:22.556 --> 00:18:25.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
then I'm afraid it's not
my place to say.

00:18:25.158 --> 00:18:27.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a personal matter
I should discuss.

00:18:29.128 --> 00:18:30.898 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That's what</i>
 <i>the teacher said.</i>

00:18:30.997 --> 00:18:34.033 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kotomi's parents are really
important scientists, isn't
that correct?

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:38.071 position:5% line:77% align:start
Are they both famous for any
scientific experiments that
they were doing?

00:18:40.908 --> 00:18:44.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] The universe is not just
that which we can see.

00:18:44.712 --> 00:18:48.249 position:5% line:83% align:start
When this world was developing
its ideal shape and form,

00:18:48.349 --> 00:18:51.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
a microscopic dimension
was sealed away.

00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:53.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
A hidden world exists.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Ichinoses were the first
to ascertain that.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps it's more
correct to say,

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:01.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
they were supposed to
have ascertained that.

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
All that sounds awfully complex
to a kid like me.

00:19:03.864 --> 00:19:08.202 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can say, that for those
of us who assisted this
revolutionary research,

00:19:08.302 --> 00:19:10.304 position:5% line:89% align:start
it was the honor of a lifetime.

00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
However...

00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:15.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid that's about all
I can say regarding this matter.

00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:20.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me ask you something, did
Kotomi say anything about me?

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:24.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
She said that you
were a bad man.

00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:28.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess to Kotomi, every one
of us are all still very bad.

00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:32.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, are you a classmate
of hers by any chance?

00:19:32.894 --> 00:19:36.363 position:5% line:77% align:start
She and I are in different
classes, but we're friends
all the same.

00:19:36.898 --> 00:19:38.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:42.202 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you have a chance, would
you please give her a message
for me?

00:19:42.303 --> 00:19:44.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
None of us really expect
her to be forgiving,

00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:49.544 position:5% line:77% align:start
but there's not a member of the
team that does regret what
happened back then.

00:19:49.644 --> 00:19:50.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
What happened back...?

00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:52.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] That's all.

00:19:52.112 --> 00:19:53.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, excuse me.

00:19:58.687 --> 00:20:00.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>I've seen this</i>
 <i>place before.</i>

00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:07.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>No, I've never entered</i>
 <i>through the front door.</i>

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:09.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Somewhere else...</i>

00:20:42.797 --> 00:20:46.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] The day before
yesterday, I saw a rabbit.

00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:13.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day before yesterday,
I saw a rabbit.

00:21:14.562 --> 00:21:17.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:21:26.408 --> 00:21:29.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
And today, it's you.

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:32.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
[rustle]

00:21:53.102 --> 00:21:55.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:04.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
You and I did meet...

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We met when
we were children.

00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:44.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
The third period was
changed to study hall.

00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:47.584 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say I was getting
worried about you.

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:52.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, what are you doing
loitering around here?

00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:53.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just a little shopping.

00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:57.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, aren't you
Mr Moneybags, then?

00:23:57.661 --> 00:24:00.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alrighty then, I guess I'll
put in a little more work.

00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:02.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
[teacher] Let me ask you,

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:04.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
did you know that
there's talk of Ichinose

00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:06.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
going abroad to study?

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:08.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Studying abroad?

00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Goodnight, Kotomi.</i>
