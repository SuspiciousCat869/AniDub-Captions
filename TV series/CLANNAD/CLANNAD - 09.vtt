00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:11.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Furukawa, won't Sanae
and your dad be worried

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:14.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
that you're gone this
late at night?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You don't need
to worry, Okazaki.

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:19.812 position:5% line:77% align:start
I told my parents that
I was going to be with
Fu-chan tonight.

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:22.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really? How did your
dad react to that?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You mean hearing
Fu-chan's name?

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:26.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looked like he might
remember something again.

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:31.420 position:5% line:77% align:start
So, I guess that he hasn't
forgotten everything about
her after all.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] If we're discovered,
we'll be scolded, I guess.

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:14.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We'll just worry
about that when it happens.

00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:16.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
[rip, rip, rip]

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, you're being
a little hasty, aren't you?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just can't wait anymore!

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:22.513 position:5% line:83% align:start
I swear you're such
a little kid.

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not little, I'm just short.

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:26.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Inside, I'm more
adult than you!

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:31.288 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't believe I'm being told
that by someone opening a toy
like it's Christmas morning.

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:35.891 position:5% line:77% align:start
Even if my head knows it,
I can't control what my
hands do!

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:39.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
[content cooing]

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:44.733 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki?

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:45.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh no! My hat is gone!

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.070 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where did it go?!

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's over here.

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:53.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
Waah!

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't take my super special
treasure away from me!

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're such an adult,
then show your self-control.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.379 position:5% line:89% align:start
Errr...

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm an adult but I'm becoming
a child momentarily!

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.684 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Oof!
[Nagisa] Fu-chan! Okazaki!
[Fuko] Give it back!

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:09.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:03:09.252 --> 00:03:11.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
[gasp]
[crash]

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Are you all right?

00:03:16.191 --> 00:03:17.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
[pained groan]

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was a child only
for just now.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me.

00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:24.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
N-Never mind, just hurry
up and get off of me!

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're heavier than you look,
you know that?

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're the same age as me,
then act like it.

00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:32.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're much more
of a child than I am.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:33.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, if you were
really an adult,

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:36.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
you could call a close female
friend by her first name.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please tell me how can you jump
so far off the subject?

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.082 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm just saying that Yusuke
calls my sister by her
first name,

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
and my big sister always
calls him Yu-kun.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're both very adult people.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, yeah. I always call
you Fuko, don't I?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Nagisa.

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:54.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
You two seem very close to me,

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:58.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
yet you both call each other
by your last names

00:03:58.326 --> 00:03:59.428 position:5% line:89% align:start
a lot of the times.

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:00.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
It seems too distant.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.230 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, if you're both adults,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
you should call each other
by your first names.

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:05.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
That is not a very
logical argument.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's not. This is too sudden
for me to talk to you that way.

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:13.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well then, it won't kill you if
you both just try it, will it?

00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:15.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki, you use "chan",

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:18.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
and Nagisa you can
add "kun" to it.

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:19.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:21.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ready, set, go!

00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
U- Nagi...
[groan]

00:04:25.883 --> 00:04:28.619 position:5% line:89% align:start
T-Tomoya-kun?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa-chan...

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:30.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
How can I say that?!

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.190 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I agree with Okazaki.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is unbearably
embarrassing for me, too!

00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:39.662 position:5% line:77% align:start
See there? That just proves that
the two of you are more
childish than me.

00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:40.730 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute!

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
At least let me drop
the "chan", will you?

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the way I talk
to Kyou and Tomoyo.

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:47.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, try it,
why don't you there?

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:51.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh... Nagisa...
[sigh]

00:04:51.138 --> 00:04:53.107 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is easier.

00:04:53.207 --> 00:04:55.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was a little bit easier,
I guess.

00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:57.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, the same with me,

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:00.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I... I still need
a little more time

00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:03.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
to be totally comfortable
talking to you this way.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Let's compromise
with that.

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:07.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you acting so bossy
all of a sudden?

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:13.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I... Because I like
both you and Nagisa very much,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I only want you to be
very happy together.

00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:20.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just like my sister and
Yusuke are happy together.

00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:29.804 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] H-Hey...

00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:31.371 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:39.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
There you go. We're all done.

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:43.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
[awe and giggling]

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:46.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
Does it look good on me?
Does it look good?

00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
With that party hat on,
you're the best in Japan.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:50.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
No mistake about it.

00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:52.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You look really
adorable, Fu-chan.

00:05:52.556 --> 00:05:54.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, you're embarrassing me.

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:02.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm the best in Japan!

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe that you're in
such high spirits already.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
The wedding's the day after
tomorrow, you know.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:11.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder... Can we have
an advance celebration?

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
Advance celebration?

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean for the wedding?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bride and groom
aren't here.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do they have to be here?

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I think it will
be okay, Fu-chan.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:25.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's have a little celebration,
just the three of us.

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're right. There are vending
machines on the first floor.

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:30.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] There must be matches
in the home economics room.

00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:36.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Ooh!

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is absolutely wonderful!

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.999 position:5% line:77% align:start
I bet you'd just be happy to sit
here all night with that hat on
your head, you know?

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, that's not the only thing
that makes me happy!

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
[content sigh]

00:06:51.338 --> 00:06:53.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] All together now!

00:06:53.207 --> 00:06:54.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
My dear sister,

00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:56.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
congratulations!

00:06:56.642 --> 00:06:58.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Kouko,
we wish you all the best!

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:01.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
Miss Ibuki, congratulations
on your big day!

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
[pop, pop]
[clapping]

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh dear, my ears are ringing...

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Fuko, you have
tape in your hair.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Hee, hee.
You too, Okazaki.

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:21.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Furu... No...

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa, you too.

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, yes...

00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:43.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's wrong, Fuko?
Are you cold?

00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:46.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's sit close together
like oshikuramanju.

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
That way, it'll be
a lot warmer for us.

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:50.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll be the Big Dango Family.

00:07:55.092 --> 00:07:58.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sitting like this, we really
are like one happy family.

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, we are.

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:20.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
[birds tweeting]

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-Furukawa?

00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:43.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's going on? Why are we
sleeping here on the floor?

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:45.800 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki?

00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:48.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:56.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, did we spend the
entire night here at school?

00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:59.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sure seems that way,
doesn't it?

00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:02.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I guess we were planning
to get the the Drama Club

00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:04.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
up and running again and
we fell asleep?

00:09:04.749 --> 00:09:08.619 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now that you mention it,
I think that may be
what happened...

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
But all this...
This is a strange...

00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:16.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry for staying
out without permission!

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:18.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We fell asleep
by accident.

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:20.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door slamming open]

00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:23.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] You think an excuse
like that will pass?

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:25.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Akio, no!
[Nagisa] Father, stop!

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:28.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I... I know that's
what you told me,

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I really want
to believe you,

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:32.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it's just so hard
to swallow.

00:09:32.306 --> 00:09:35.343 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] It's a little farfetched.
[Sanae] Me too.
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:39.446 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] I seem to have heard
you had something important to
do and wouldn't be home today.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:42.715 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Sanae] Yes,
I distinctly remember...
[Tomoya] I don't suppose
you remember

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:46.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
what that was by any chance?

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:50.554 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] Strangely, I don't
remember the details of what
you two were doing.

00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:52.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Aarg! I have to say,

00:09:52.956 --> 00:09:55.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
this is really getting
me aggravated!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm not like your
father, but I've been
feeling hazy.

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:06.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like that something I can't
remember is very important.

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:11.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, look at this.

00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:16.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was in the Drama Club
room this morning.

00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:18.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
And there was one
in my room as well.

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:22.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
Strangely, I don't remember
where I could have received it.

00:10:23.282 --> 00:10:25.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I look at it,
I feel calmed.

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:30.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
When you look at it, don't you
experience the same kind
of feeling?

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
looking so dazed?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's because I'm trying
to remember something.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:49.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
Remember something? Like what?

00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:52.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
Beats me.
I just don't know what.

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:55.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, so you've got free time?

00:10:55.675 --> 00:10:57.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, why don't you come
with me tomorrow?

00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:58.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going shopping
with my little sister.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:01.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why not join us? It'll be fun.

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:02.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow?

00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:04.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like I have
plans tomorrow,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I don't know what they are.

00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:07.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's with the vague answer?

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:08.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just say yes or no!

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not trying to be vague.

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:12.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I just can't
shake the feeling

00:11:12.123 --> 00:11:14.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
that there's really something
going on tomorrow.

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:18.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Something very
important that I have to do...

00:11:20.797 --> 00:11:22.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Is that so?

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
You too?

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:24.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, and I feel like

00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:26.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
that there's something important
happening tomorrow,

00:11:26.902 --> 00:11:29.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I can't remember what it is.

00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:32.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
There must be something to it.

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's try to remember.

00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:42.248 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Mr. Koumura, what are
you doing with that brush
and banner?

00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:44.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't you see for yourself?

00:11:45.984 --> 00:11:48.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, is someone you know
getting married?

00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:52.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
You sure ask strange things.

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:55.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me your memory
is going bad at your age?

00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
Being told that by you is more
than a little depressing.

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:02.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look at it closely and
remember our discussion.

00:12:07.669 --> 00:12:08.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:09.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember!

00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:11.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miss Ibuki!

00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:16.844 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was because of your request
that caused this wedding will
be held at the school.

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right.
That's what it is.

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:22.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no! We forgot something
this important?

00:12:22.281 --> 00:12:27.119 position:5% line:77% align:start
Furukawa, I can't remember,
why did you and I want to
celebrate Kouko's marriage?

00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:29.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Koumura] There you go saying
strange things again.

00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:34.291 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was because you have that
kind of relationship with her,
isn't it?

00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:35.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I remember correctly,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.696 position:5% line:83% align:start
wasn't I the one who introduced
you to Miss Ibuki?

00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:42.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I... Somehow I feel like
there was one more person

00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:44.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
who brought us together.

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:46.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just certain that there
was somebody else.

00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:49.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
There was another person...

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, it Miss Ibuki's sister,
wasn't it?

00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.708 position:5% line:89% align:start
Her sister?

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:58.311 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, if you'll excuse me.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:04.116 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, did he say
Miss Ibuki's sister?

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Fuko!

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right! It was Fuko!

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:12.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're here...

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:14.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan...

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:17.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, you were... You were
beside us all this time?

00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:18.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes...

00:13:19.729 --> 00:13:21.063 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm the worst, aren't I?

00:13:21.164 --> 00:13:24.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, it's the one thing
I didn't want to forget,

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:25.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I forgot it.

00:13:25.535 --> 00:13:27.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're not the worst, Okazaki.

00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:29.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's only natural.

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:35.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, please Fuko, don't say
anything so sad!

00:13:35.242 --> 00:13:38.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Fuko. We want to be
with you always.

00:13:38.612 --> 00:13:40.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan, let's stay together.

00:13:41.047 --> 00:13:44.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
Until the wedding,
be together always.

00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:13:56.893 --> 00:14:01.264 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] It seems having the
wedding at the school was
the bride's request.

00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:06.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
None of the students are here
to celebrate the big occasion.

00:14:06.268 --> 00:14:10.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Okazaki and you are here
to celebrate with me.

00:14:19.012 --> 00:14:21.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
[minister] The shape of the
wedding ring has two meanings.

00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:23.449 position:5% line:89% align:start
One is eternity.

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:25.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
The other is completeness.

00:14:25.884 --> 00:14:27.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
These two halves of one circle,

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:32.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
forever intertwined comprise the
holy sacrament of marriage.

00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:34.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
With the exchanging
of the rings, you promise

00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:37.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
to be loyal to each other for
the rest of your lives.

00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:38.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
Repeat after me:

00:14:38.662 --> 00:14:40.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
With this ring...

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:44.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
I pledge my eternal and
undying love to you.

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:46.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yusuke] From now until
death do us part.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.903 position:5% line:89% align:start
[applause]

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki,
where are we going?

00:14:54.542 --> 00:14:57.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's send them off
with louder cheers than anyone.

00:14:57.211 --> 00:14:58.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right, Fuko?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, what is this?

00:15:15.426 --> 00:15:16.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
[oinking]

00:15:18.562 --> 00:15:20.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyou... Fujibayashi...

00:15:22.031 --> 00:15:22.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought you told me
that you were

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:24.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
going shopping this afternoon?

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:29.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, well, that's what
we had planned, but then...

00:15:29.572 --> 00:15:33.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
This morning, when we got up
and saw this reminder star,

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:34.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
we remembered the wedding.

00:15:35.042 --> 00:15:38.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
We felt that we just had to come
to congratulate them.

00:15:39.346 --> 00:15:39.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey there!

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:41.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara!

00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:42.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You came after all,
didn't you?

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:45.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I had a little time
on my hands.

00:15:45.718 --> 00:15:48.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like all these
other guys did, too.

00:15:57.961 --> 00:15:59.530 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Father! And Mother!

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well look at this, you're
here too. I should've known.

00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:07.069 position:5% line:77% align:start
Really, to forget about a
beautiful wedding until
the very day of it!

00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:09.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
I must have been crazy.

00:16:14.609 --> 00:16:15.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your thoughts reached them.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:17.779 position:5% line:89% align:start
They all remembered.

00:16:17.878 --> 00:16:20.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Everyone remembered
the wedding.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:25.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I just can't believe it.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it super?

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
[applause & cheering]

00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:47.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki...
[Tomoya] Hm?

00:16:47.603 --> 00:16:49.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] That dream about you
that I mentioned before...

00:16:49.104 --> 00:16:51.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Dream?
[Fuko] Do you remember it?

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:54.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] The dream about
the Starfish Festival.

00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:58.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
As I played alone on the beach,
you pulled my hand.

00:16:58.179 --> 00:17:00.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said,
"What are you doing?"

00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:03.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Today is the Starfish
Festival, you know."

00:17:03.882 --> 00:17:05.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ever since I met you
and Nagisa,

00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:07.553 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's what it's been like.

00:17:07.654 --> 00:17:10.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
You always took me
to fun places.

00:17:10.556 --> 00:17:13.057 position:5% line:89% align:start
Every day was like a festival.

00:17:13.891 --> 00:17:15.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's been a lot of fun.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:17:17.228 --> 00:17:19.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sniffling]
[Fuko] I had a lot of fun.

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:23.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
The most fun I've ever
had in my life.

00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:27.503 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffling]

00:17:32.707 --> 00:17:34.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Okazaki, Nagisa?

00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:38.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kouko...

00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:41.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Is something wrong?

00:17:41.115 --> 00:17:43.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
You both seem so sad.

00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:48.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to listen
to my story.

00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:52.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
There was someone who waited
so long for this day.

00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:57.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Someone who worked
so hard just for this day.

00:17:57.161 --> 00:17:59.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
She lived and dreamed
just for this day,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it was all that
kept her going.

00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:05.802 position:5% line:77% align:start
All alone, she gathered
blessings for you and
your fiancé.

00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:06.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] We loved her.

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because we truly loved her...

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:17.678 position:5% line:77% align:start
I see it so clearly now. You and
Nagisa were always with her,
weren't you, Okazaki?

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:21.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was because she and I enjoyed
spending time with her.

00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:22.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
We were happy together.

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:26.185 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you see? Everyone here
felt the same way.

00:18:27.186 --> 00:18:29.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, Miss Kouko, please...

00:18:29.155 --> 00:18:30.989 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's all we want, Kouko!

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:33.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be happy for
your sister, Fuko!

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:43.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:14.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations,
my dear big sister.

00:19:15.993 --> 00:19:20.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please be happy.
Please be happy forever.

00:19:21.064 --> 00:19:24.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Forever and always,
be happy...

00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:26.335 position:5% line:89% align:start
in your love.

00:19:27.503 --> 00:19:29.205 position:5% line:89% align:start
My dear Fu-chan...

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:53.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Fu-chan said,
"Congratulations."

00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:56.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Please be happy forever."

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:02.265 position:5% line:77% align:start
I think... I think that she must
have been congratulating me in
her dreams.

00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:04.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] That thought reached me.

00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:08.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
If we continue to be happy,

00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:10.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
she can be happy too.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can believe that now.

00:20:15.042 --> 00:20:17.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
Believe it with all my heart.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Did you hear?

00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:26.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
The rumor about the student
who was in a coma

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.954 position:5% line:83% align:start
after the accident
two years ago.

00:20:28.053 --> 00:20:31.924 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] She's the sister of Miss
Ibuki who was married the
other day.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
You remember, don't you?

00:20:33.893 --> 00:20:36.461 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard that sister
is really cute.

00:20:37.829 --> 00:20:39.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? And who's saying that?

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
A rumor, just a rumor.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you know, doesn't it seem
sort of real in a way?

00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:47.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, I feel like I know
this girl somehow.

00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:50.773 position:5% line:77% align:start
And that she's still here,
always running around
the school.

00:20:53.408 --> 00:20:55.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
It does kind of seem that way.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
Doesn't it?

00:20:58.345 --> 00:21:01.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
Say, it's been bothering me,
but that carving you have...

00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:05.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean this little thing?
I just found it in my dorm room.

00:21:05.184 --> 00:21:09.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's funny that I don't
remember how I got it exactly,

00:21:09.121 --> 00:21:10.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
but wait... Hey wait a minute!

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is...!

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:12.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
It is!

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:15.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why, yes! I believe it's a...

00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:17.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
[everyone] A starfish!

00:21:20.565 --> 00:21:22.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
But how could any
of us know that?

00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:24.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
How could we...?

00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:26.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, wake up, you!

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:27.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't just sleep through this,

00:21:27.737 --> 00:21:29.538 position:5% line:89% align:start
join in the conversation.

00:21:29.638 --> 00:21:31.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya!

00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:35.343 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That girl student</i>
 <i>suddenly became the talk</i>
 <i>of the school.</i>

00:21:36.811 --> 00:21:40.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Pure and earnest, running</i>
 <i>around the school...</i>

00:21:42.883 --> 00:21:44.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's the image of the girl.</i>

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.122 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>And then, we all waited,</i>

00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:52.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>for the day that girl</i>
 <i>might awaken.</i>

00:21:54.092 --> 00:21:56.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I was definitely one of them.</i>

00:21:56.995 --> 00:22:00.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>And that day will someday...</i>

00:22:01.532 --> 00:22:04.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please...
please be my friend!

00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:07.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
Be one of my very best
friends, would you?

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what are you, a bully?

00:23:44.484 --> 00:23:46.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Yes, well,
what I mean to tell you is

00:23:46.853 --> 00:23:50.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I think you're a really
fun person, Ichinose.

00:23:50.823 --> 00:23:51.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will she bully me?

00:23:51.991 --> 00:23:53.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, if you would like me to.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.461 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, will I have
to shed any tears?

00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think, if the
role calls for it,

00:23:58.563 --> 00:24:02.900 position:5% line:77% align:start
you might have to shed a few
tears and maybe cry
a little bit.

00:24:03.001 --> 00:24:04.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I really don't want to cry.

00:24:04.668 --> 00:24:08.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even so, if you have to cry,
you'll cry.

00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:10.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, are you
a bully, too?

00:24:10.206 --> 00:24:11.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes!
