00:00:02.214 --> 00:00:05.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Good morning!
How are you, Okazaki?

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:05.983 position:5% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:08.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look at my newest creations!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a second, could this be...

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:15.624 position:5% line:77% align:start
I spent the entire Golden
Week developing these
yummy pastries.

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:19.194 position:5% line:77% align:start
I designed every single one
of them from cream-filled
to jam-filled.

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:21.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, what do you think
of my culinary work?

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:26.566 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Actually, I think
it's the worst.
[Sanae] That's the exact same
reaction as Akio's!

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:31.570 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Where is he, exactly?
[Sanae] He left the shop just as
soon as I had pulled them out of
the oven.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.773 position:5% line:77% align:start
His last words were,
"Sanae, you are the cutest
woman in the entire world."

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:40.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
"However, the pastries you make
are the worst I've ever tasted."

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was crying a moment before
you came in here,

00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:44.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
but then I thought,
"I'll just go it alone,"

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then I pulled myself
together by my boot straps.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:52.017 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] So, Okazaki, how about
tasting just one of them, huh?
[Tomoya] I don't want any.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
Akio, it's impossible for me
to do it alone without you.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were awfully quick
to perceive that.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:34.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] I guess I'll
go look for Akio.

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:38.264 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you want to see Nagisa
and Fuko, they're inside.

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:40.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door opening and closing]

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, good morning
to you, Okazaki.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:43.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
How are you?

00:02:43.168 --> 00:02:44.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where'd Ms. Sanae go to?

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
There was a telephone
call for her just now.

00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:48.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
She went on a little
mission to find Akio.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of call was it?

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:52.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was breathing heavily,
and laughing a lot,

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:56.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then he kept saying "I love
you, I love you," over and over.

00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:58.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Isn't that
a crank call?

00:02:58.146 --> 00:03:01.950 position:5% line:77% align:start
But he said, "Seriously,
please stop making those
starfish pastries."

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, it was Akio.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, and when Fu-chan
said his name,

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.587 position:5% line:83% align:start
he started screaming
and he cut the phone line.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:11.423 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, he was declaring his
undying love to his daughter's
friend after all.

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:14.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] This is...

00:03:15.092 --> 00:03:17.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
So this is the barrier
that imprisons Fuko!

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:19.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:21.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Look, every time
she recovers,

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
her eyes greet this countless
number of starfish!

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
They send her back
into her fantasy.

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:32.204 position:5% line:77% align:start
At this rate, it will be
difficult to ever bring
her back to this reality!

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
And...

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:35.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
After several hundred years,

00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
when a more evolved humanity
controls mankind,

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:44.013 position:5% line:77% align:start
a lone traveler approaches
the Furukawa home,
fallen into ruins.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:55.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
[traveler] Legendary
starfish tamer,

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
lend us humans your power.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
Appear, Fuko!

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Not likely to sell...

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
No! I think it was
very interesting.

00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:25.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to hear more
of that story.

00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:27.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's a joke.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
But looking at it from
this perspective,

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
it won't be a joke for long.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki, what...

00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:37.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll pay for it later.

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:40.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] No, it's not
like that...

00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:43.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I messed up last time.
This is my revenge.

00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:48.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
[smooch]

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:49.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eh...

00:04:49.262 --> 00:04:51.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
My nose felt funny just now!

00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:53.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Is that so?
That's strange.

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
And my throat is all wet
for some reason.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
I finally did it,
success at last!

00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:01.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, stop!

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:03.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Here, it's a present.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please accept it.

00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:07.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Day after day, I'm
amazed she can keep on doing it.

00:05:07.877 --> 00:05:11.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
She must have approached at
least half the student body
with those starfish.

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:13.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me...

00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:19.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
Excuse me, sir,
please accept this.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
[student] What is this?

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, I would like
more than anything

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:26.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
for Fu-chan and Miss Ibuki
to finally meet.

00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:28.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Because Fu-chan
is working so hard.

00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:35.931 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll go to the art room and
get more pieces of unwanted
wood, okay?

00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute,
I'll go with you then.

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] No, Okazaki, you stay
here and watch over Fu-chan.

00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:42.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Furukawa! Wait!

00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:43.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I said I'd go with you!
[Fuko] Waah!

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is your problem?

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:46.539 position:5% line:89% align:start
Help me, Okazaki!

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.507 position:5% line:77% align:start
There are lots of people
like you chasing after me!
I'm scared!

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
So if these people chasing
you are like me,

00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:53.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
why are you
asking me for help?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Necessity knows no law!

00:05:55.446 --> 00:05:57.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What's wrong with you?
That's no way to ask for help!

00:05:57.915 --> 00:05:59.449 position:5% line:89% align:start
[fanboys] Oh, Fuko!

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:01.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, are you
a friend of Fuko's?

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
He is not! He's my enemy!

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:04.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't say things that will
complicate matters any further.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:08.221 position:5% line:77% align:start
We want to start a Fuko Fan
Club because we just
worship Fuko-chan.

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:12.492 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] What kind of fan club?
[fan a] Or maybe we'll start
a support group of some
kind for us.

00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:17.328 position:5% line:77% align:start
All of us are simply dumb-struck
by Fuko giving her beautiful
hand carved star carvings

00:06:17.428 --> 00:06:19.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
to all sorts of kids in our
class that she didn't even know!

00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:21.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
We thought that all of Fuko's
avid fans could possibly

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:24.701 position:5% line:77% align:start
help bring her new levels
of excitement to her
sister's wedding!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.869 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, what do
you think?
[Fuko] I don't want your help.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.070 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
[fan b] We'll do our
best anyway!

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.574 position:5% line:77% align:start
[fan c] To be honest, we didn't
expect her to accept
us immediately.

00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:34.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think all of you are
just wasting your time.

00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:37.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
She's not the type to
be emotionally moved
by something like that.

00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:42.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] That's like saying
I'm a cold and wild person.

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:44.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm actually the type
that honors kindness.

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:47.151 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know about that. You're
pretty unsociable with me.

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:52.221 position:5% line:77% align:start
All of us will work our fingers
to the bone until the day Fuko
trusts all of us!

00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:55.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because we are absolutely
infatuated with Fuko.

00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:58.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
O' dear brother of Fuko,
we seek to beg your pardon.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
They think you and
I are siblings.

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's terrible.

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:04.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's my line!

00:07:06.632 --> 00:07:10.136 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] It's true that there
are more people accepting
a starfish,

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:13.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it's only a fraction
of the total student body.

00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:15.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, look here.

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:17.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's almost
Founder's Festival.

00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
Every year in May, we have
a mini-school festival.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:23.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now, every club
is busy with preparations.

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:25.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everybody's really looking
forward to it.

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:28.949 position:5% line:77% align:start
On the day of the festival,
students are happy and there
will be outside guests.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
If we distribute them there,

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
there'll be more people
who will come to the wedding.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
[door opening]
Hmm?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
This sales meeting is for
which department store?

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:39.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Oh, it's the guy with
the weird hair color.

00:07:39.123 --> 00:07:40.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're still very rude to me.

00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:43.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
And after I came all this
way to help you guys out.

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:46.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, are you going
to help us, Sunohara?

00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:49.297 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wonderful of you to volunteer.

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:50.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute, are you serious?

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:51.900 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course, you know how much

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want get on
Nagisa's good side.

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:56.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I'm joining your little
group to help you out!

00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:58.604 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] Don't want you.
[Tomoya] Well,
goodbye, Sunohara.

00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:00.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
Isn't that just a
bit coldhearted?!

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.941 position:5% line:83% align:start
Weird people will always
do weird things,

00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:04.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
so there will be problems.

00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know this first hand
from watching Okazaki.

00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:08.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're lumping me with him?

00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:11.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okay, then you
have a match with me!

00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:14.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stop it! You know
fighting's not good!

00:08:14.184 --> 00:08:17.385 position:5% line:77% align:start
She's right! You're going
to get kicked right into
the trash chute again!

00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:22.689 position:5% line:83% align:start
NO! Are you saying it's a sure
thing that I'll lose to her?!

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You mean
a carving contest?

00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
That conforms to sportsmanship
so I think it's a great idea.

00:08:29.128 --> 00:08:30.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is not a sport you nitwit.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:33.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I carve better than you can
carve, you have to let me in.

00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:36.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
If not, I promise
I'll give up the idea.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:37.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's okay with you?

00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:38.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm.

00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:40.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, the theme is...

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:42.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nue!

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:43.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nue?

00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:44.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] The head of a monkey,

00:08:44.538 --> 00:08:46.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
the body of a badger,
the tail of a snake,

00:08:46.407 --> 00:08:48.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
and the hands and feet
look like a tiger,

00:08:48.274 --> 00:08:49.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
a monster!

00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:51.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Ooh.
[Fuko] Let's see...

00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:53.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
The head of a monkey,
the body of a dog,

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:55.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
the tail of a pidge,
and it likes millet dumplings.

00:08:55.714 --> 00:08:58.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry but there was not one
single mention of what it likes.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, never mind. Ready?

00:09:00.818 --> 00:09:02.486 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:04.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki?
[Tomoya] Hmm?

00:09:04.154 --> 00:09:07.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you think you and I could
see a nue if we go to the zoo?

00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:11.459 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course not, it's a beast
that only appears in mythology
and legend.

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:14.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, is that so? I thought
it might actually exist

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:16.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I really wanted to see one.

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:18.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] This is a room
full of idiots.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Finished!
[Youhei] That fast?! No way!

00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:25.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] What?!
[Tomoya] Th-This is...

00:09:30.107 --> 00:09:31.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah!

00:09:31.307 --> 00:09:33.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
And where exactly
is the nue in this?!

00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:35.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] This is the best
that I could do.

00:09:35.744 --> 00:09:37.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:09:37.146 --> 00:09:38.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Good job, Fuko!

00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:40.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you carve something
different from the theme,

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:41.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
then you get zero points.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, the win is mine.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Irk!

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara's default, Fuko wins.

00:09:48.486 --> 00:09:49.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
You could worry a little bit!

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:52.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should go to the
infirmary right away.

00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:57.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Invite Miss Ibuki
to the Founder's Festival?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Yes, I think we should.

00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:03.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
We should invite Miss Ibuki and
arrange for them to meet.

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:06.034 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I see...
That may be a great idea.

00:10:06.134 --> 00:10:07.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko!

00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa and have something
we really have to do.

00:10:09.569 --> 00:10:12.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about you go on home and
we'll see you a little later?

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] We'll return
right away.

00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:19.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can she go home alone?

00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:22.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, Okazaki.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:23.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan's a big girl.

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:26.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, Nagisa, she's the
exact same age as I am.

00:10:26.982 --> 00:10:28.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
Someone could say you and I are

00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:32.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
just like Fu-chan's father
and mother, aren't we?

00:10:32.654 --> 00:10:33.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:36.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
N-Never mind,
forget I said that,

00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:38.457 position:5% line:89% align:start
please, please, please.

00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:50.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yusuke Yoshino?

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.303 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Nagisa] Are you saying that
you know him?
[Tomoya] Wait a minute,
hold on there.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:57.039 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't tell me that you're
actually the guy who's
Kouko's fiancé.

00:10:58.472 --> 00:11:00.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, her student, is that what
you're telling me?

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:05.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, in my first year,
she was a great help to me.

00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:09.148 position:5% line:77% align:start
We came here today because we
both wanted to invite Kouko
to the Founder's Festival.

00:11:09.248 --> 00:11:10.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's something
we want to show her.

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:14.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
It will surely be a terrific
day full of fun and festivities.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm. That's a very good idea.

00:11:18.454 --> 00:11:20.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you saying you'll come then?

00:11:20.522 --> 00:11:22.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whether she goes
or not is up to her,

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:27.294 position:5% line:77% align:start
but somehow I think that just
hearing about it will greatly
lift her little spirits.

00:11:27.394 --> 00:11:29.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good luck.

00:11:29.196 --> 00:11:31.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
You want me to go
to the festival?

00:11:31.164 --> 00:11:33.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I quit teaching at that
school three years ago.

00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:36.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now the only student I know
there is you, Nagisa.

00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:38.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you know some
of the teachers there.

00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:40.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
And besides, there'll be lots
of really great games,

00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:43.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
and food stands,
and refreshments.

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:45.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh please come;
you must!

00:11:45.774 --> 00:11:46.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, well...

00:11:48.077 --> 00:11:50.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] All right, I will.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:54.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
Before the accident,
I promised my sister...

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
made a solemn promise
to her that I would go

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:01.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
to the Founder's Festival after
she entered the school.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, I'll walk around and see
all the wonderful sights there,

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:07.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
then go tell my dear
sister about them.

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:11.094 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I-I'm sure
she'll be happy.

00:12:11.194 --> 00:12:12.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eep!

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:14.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa, what is wrong with you?!

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
please excuse me.

00:12:16.732 --> 00:12:18.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
What ever's the matter
with you, Nagisa?

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:21.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] She probably just needs
to go to the toilet very badly.

00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:22.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sniffling]
Well goodness, dear.

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:24.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you like maybe
to use my toilet, then?

00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:28.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I beg your pardon!
[sniffling]

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:38.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That was
very unnatural.

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
I couldn't hold it in.

00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:45.753 position:5% line:77% align:start
The fiancé seems
to be a kind person.
[sniffling]

00:12:45.853 --> 00:12:46.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:12:46.987 --> 00:12:48.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Getting Fuko</i>
 <i>and Miss Ibuki to meet</i>

00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:50.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>will clarify</i>
 <i>their relationship.</i>

00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:56.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if my sister will ever
be able to hear my voice?

00:12:56.228 --> 00:12:58.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffling]

00:13:04.768 --> 00:13:07.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Finally,
today is the day.

00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:09.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatever, she's working
too hard on this.

00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:12.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko worked all through
the wee hours of the night.

00:13:13.007 --> 00:13:16.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] And now we're forcing
her awake to take her...

00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:19.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, this is our only
choice, I guess.

00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.379 position:5% line:89% align:start
Quit your bellyaching, kid.

00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:22.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you were any kind
of real man,

00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:25.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
you should be able to juggle
a girl or two without a sweat.

00:13:25.482 --> 00:13:26.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't be absurd.

00:13:26.884 --> 00:13:28.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please just do your best,
will you?

00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:31.955 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] We will!
[Tomoya] Well, we'll
be going now.

00:13:35.424 --> 00:13:37.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fu-chan looks very
comfortable to me.

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:39.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
She may look that way,
but I think she'll say

00:13:39.927 --> 00:13:41.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
this is the worst ever
as soon as she gets up.

00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:45.931 position:5% line:77% align:start
Okazaki, Fu-chan doesn't
really hate you that much,
I promise you.

00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:50.034 position:5% line:77% align:start
She actually seems to enjoy
herself quite a bit whenever
you're around.

00:13:50.135 --> 00:13:53.904 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you ask me, she should let
her guard down more with
other people.

00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:57.040 position:5% line:77% align:start
She always seems to have her
guard up like a frightened
little animal.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think Fu-chan is doing
the best she can.

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:06.080 position:5% line:77% align:start
And I'm just certain that Miss
Ibuki will be happy when she
sees Fu-chan working so hard.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
I bet you're right.

00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:13.219 position:5% line:77% align:start
And let's make sure we all
give our congratulations
for her wedding.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:14.553 position:5% line:89% align:start
We will.

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:16.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:16.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, you're up.

00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:17.922 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:19.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki carried you
all the way here

00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:21.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
on his back without
ever complaining.

00:14:22.058 --> 00:14:24.194 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well I think that's
just terrible!

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:26.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
See there, I told you
she'd say something like that.

00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:32.266 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, Okazaki, Fuko said "I think"
so it's not really that
insulting to you at all.

00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:34.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's a doubtful follow-up.

00:14:35.402 --> 00:14:36.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] I'm sorry.

00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:39.305 position:5% line:83% align:start
I reflexively said
something rude to you.

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:42.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think going to the trouble
of saying "somehow" means

00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:45.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
that you didn't really mean
to say it that way on purpose.

00:14:45.243 --> 00:14:47.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
It must be because you were
carrying me on your back

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
that caused me to have
a strange dream.

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's about starfish, I bet.

00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:52.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, as a matter of fact, I was

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:55.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
playing with starfish
on a pretty beach.

00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:57.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:14:57.618 --> 00:14:59.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, Fu-chan!

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ya-hoo!

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
Check it out!
Okazaki's the best!

00:15:04.391 --> 00:15:07.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Then, you grabbed
my hand.

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:08.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What are you
doing all alone?!

00:15:08.927 --> 00:15:11.996 position:5% line:77% align:start
Today is the Starfish Festival
you know!
[giggling]

00:15:12.096 --> 00:15:14.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] So, what is the
Starfish Festival?

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:15.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
How would I know?!

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
But it sure seems like fun.

00:15:27.574 --> 00:15:31.811 position:5% line:77% align:start
I think that's the exact spot
where you should stand at the
school festival.

00:15:32.445 --> 00:15:33.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
I agree...

00:15:35.447 --> 00:15:36.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Here you go!

00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:37.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:44.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you very much for that.
It's so sweet.

00:15:48.957 --> 00:15:50.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:51.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Did you make
all of this?

00:15:53.727 --> 00:15:56.997 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course, because all of us
wanted to support Fuko no
matter what.

00:15:57.097 --> 00:15:59.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone who buys something
from our booth will get

00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:02.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
an impassioned expose about
Fuko's sister's wedding day.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you ask me, your senses
are on par with Sanae's.

00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:08.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Fu-chan!

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:11.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Stupid kid...

00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:17.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, wake up.

00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:20.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko, that outfit looks
so beautiful on you.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.118 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why am I dressed this way and
come to think of it, when did
I come to this world?

00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:27.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You were in a daze,
so we brought you here.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
You look so cute in that
uniform, Fu-chan.

00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:32.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is a joint project between
B and D classes.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
The class chairmen are twins,
so they volunteered to do this,

00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:37.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
wasn't that sweet of them both?

00:16:37.793 --> 00:16:40.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko, I bet if you presented
them to the customers,

00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:42.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
they're sure to accept them
without a second thought.

00:16:42.697 --> 00:16:44.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't mind helping as well.

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:46.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems to me that you
don't have enough help.

00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:47.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you short of starfish?!

00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:49.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not what she means!

00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:54.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Sorry to keep
you waiting.

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:56.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, thank you.

00:16:56.174 --> 00:16:57.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here! Here you go!

00:16:57.908 --> 00:16:59.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this? A coaster?

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
[customer] Is this a coaster?

00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:02.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] No, it's not a coaster!

00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:05.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look how hard
Fu-chan is working.

00:17:05.714 --> 00:17:09.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You look like
the real thing too.

00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:12.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you. I think that
waiting on my fellow students

00:17:12.253 --> 00:17:13.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
can be quite a lot of fun.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.122 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here!

00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:22.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl a] That girl's name
is Fuko, right?

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
[girl b] She seems to be
working hard for her sister.

00:17:24.628 --> 00:17:27.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
She looked so cute working,
didn't she?

00:17:27.598 --> 00:17:29.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like everything's
fine today.

00:17:29.366 --> 00:17:33.702 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, seems she became a big
school celebrity before we
knew it.

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:37.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, she's been
doing it every day.

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:46.513 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have learned something
very valuable from Fuko.

00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:48.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am going to look for new
Drama Club members

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
with just as much dedication.

00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:53.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I won't ever give up.

00:17:53.584 --> 00:17:56.419 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Then, we'll participate
in the School Festival, too.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.655 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you'll be kind enough to
let me help you, my dear Nagisa.

00:17:59.755 --> 00:18:04.626 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?
[Tomoya] What are you doing
slipping that in there
like that?

00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:06.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
My feelings for you are
very real, Nagisa.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, that girl looks
like she's not doing anything.

00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:10.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where? Where?

00:18:13.698 --> 00:18:15.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-Hey! Hey, you!

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Shall I show
you around?

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seems like his intentions
to you were short lived.

00:18:19.937 --> 00:18:22.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's okay,
that's not necessary.

00:18:22.172 --> 00:18:24.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I don't mind.
So tell me, baby,

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:26.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
what school are you from?

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:27.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oof!

00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:29.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch it!

00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:33.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
Get out of my way!
She's getting away!

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:37.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't get out of my way,
I'll use force.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, you're in for it now...

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.388 position:5% line:89% align:start
Out of my way!

00:18:46.457 --> 00:18:48.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
That kick, you must be Tomoyo.

00:18:51.627 --> 00:18:55.397 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] That's Tomoyo? The girl
who got rid of the bikers in
the school yard?

00:18:55.497 --> 00:18:59.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
I volunteered to patrol. Just
enforce school rules against

00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:02.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
people who would be rude
during this little get together.

00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:04.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] So,
what's with the costume?

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm actually kind of
famous in some parts.

00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:10.241 position:5% line:77% align:start
If I show my face, there
are some who would try
to pick a fight with me.

00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:11.442 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Excuse me...

00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:13.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you accept this, please?

00:19:13.477 --> 00:19:14.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
For me?

00:19:14.478 --> 00:19:16.279 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, it's a present for you.

00:19:16.379 --> 00:19:20.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say I don't usually
accept presents from strangers.

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:25.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this looks like
it's handmade.

00:19:25.286 --> 00:19:28.622 position:5% line:77% align:start
I receive a lot gifts from
girls, but they're not
usually handmade.

00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:30.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll accept it gratefully.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much.

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:36.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's a very kind person.

00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:38.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, what about Sunohara?

00:19:38.195 --> 00:19:39.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I wouldn't worry about him.

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:42.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's probably recovered and
chasing another girl.

00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:43.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:46.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Mitsui...?

00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:54.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, have you been doing
that all this time?

00:19:57.977 --> 00:20:00.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please accept one from me.

00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:08.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, what is the exact
date of your sister's wedding?

00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:10.786 position:5% line:89% align:start
The date isn't set just yet.

00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:13.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:20:13.155 --> 00:20:16.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mitsui] If it's not before
an exam, I may be able to go.

00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:18.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I'll see you.

00:20:20.628 --> 00:20:22.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please do your best.

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:30.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wasn't that nice of her?

00:20:30.768 --> 00:20:32.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
I thought it was.

00:20:32.503 --> 00:20:33.903 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes...

00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:36.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Yes!

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:58.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just realized, but it's almost
time for Miss Ibuki to get here.

00:20:58.122 --> 00:20:59.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:06.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miss Ibuki, over here!

00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:17.903 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, it's nice
to see you, Kouko.

00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:20.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't thank you enough
for coming, Miss Ibuki.

00:21:20.773 --> 00:21:23.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well hello there, Nagisa,
and you, Okazaki.

00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:26.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so terribly sorry,
was I a little bit late?

00:21:26.343 --> 00:21:27.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:29.413 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:31.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] It's been a while
since I've been here.

00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was a little nervous.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
The place hasn't changed,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it is like a
different school.

00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:41.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
Silly me, it must be because I
don't know any of the students.

00:21:41.322 --> 00:21:42.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:45.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, my goodness gracious me.
I'm so silly.

00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:48.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I was relieved
to see the two of you.

00:21:50.027 --> 00:21:51.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
The two of us?

00:21:52.163 --> 00:21:53.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:21:55.532 --> 00:21:57.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because I just can't.

00:21:57.467 --> 00:22:00.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Because my sister isn't
able to hear me from here.

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:03.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think that's why I'm here.

00:22:03.604 --> 00:22:04.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:07.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there something the matter?

00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:09.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Nagisa? Okazaki?

00:23:41.512 --> 00:23:44.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you would like to,
I would very much like

00:23:44.113 --> 00:23:46.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
you to come to my sister's
upcoming wedding.

00:23:46.548 --> 00:23:47.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
[oinking]

00:23:47.582 --> 00:23:49.984 position:5% line:89% align:start
A starfish can do that much!

00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:53.254 position:5% line:89% align:start
[contented cooing]

00:23:54.254 --> 00:23:56.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
I gotta tell ya,
after you left with Nagisa,

00:23:56.856 --> 00:23:58.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
a strange thing happened.

00:23:58.524 --> 00:24:01.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry to say that I'm
not versed on animals...

00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:03.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
I accept your challenge!

00:24:03.628 --> 00:24:06.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's out and out
harassment if you ask me.
