 <i>[Voice] Once again a new</i>
 <i>light is born.</i>

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:11.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Sometime long ago...</i>

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:16.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Or perhaps sometime in the</i>
 <i>distant future...</i>

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I was in a different world.</i>

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>That single sensation</i>
 <i>is all I remember.</i>

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:27.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] A different world?
What kind of a place was it?

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you remember? Do you think it
was a better place than this?

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:34.282 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Voice] I think so.</i>

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:35.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if the world wasn't empty,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
did you still feel lonely
sometimes?

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:40.721 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Voice] Probably.</i>

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:45.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] Were you ever as lonely
as you are now?

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:54.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] A girl living alone in</i>
 <i>a world that has ended...</i>

00:00:54.697 --> 00:01:00.002 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>An empty and still world.</i>
 <i>This was place that had</i>
 <i>nothing.</i>

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>It was void of all happiness.</i>

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Perhaps that is why</i>
 <i>I was born.</i>

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:09.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
Was this your wish?

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] Did you want to be born
into a world like this?

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:03.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Lend her your name?

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Yeah, all she needs
is numbers, right?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.895 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm not interested in acting,
but I don't mind if she puts
me down as a member.

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:11.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet Nagisa's gonna be real
grateful I'm helping out.

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
And one day the gratitude will
turn into love! [laughs]

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:18.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey Nagisa, I've got a big
surprise for ya!

00:03:18.103 --> 00:03:21.872 position:5% line:77% align:start
Guess what? Ryou and I have
decided to lend our names
to the Drama Club.

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:25.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't that great?

00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:28.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
To tell you the truth, I'm not
really interested in acting,

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:31.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I want to help you guys
get the club approved.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now the club has four members.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:36.215 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's enough for the student
council to offically
recognize us.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:38.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know guys, don't you
feel kind of guilty

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:41.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
for trying to trick the student
council like this?

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't be so uptight!

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:45.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on Nagisa, everyone's
trying to help you out.

00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:47.024 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not gonna let all that
go to waste, are you?

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:50.492 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Now that we've made up
our mind, let's get this show on
the road!

00:03:50.592 --> 00:03:53.695 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Forward march!
[Tomoya] Come on, Nagisa,
toughen a little.

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I'll do my best.
[Kyou] Hurry up, Tomoya!

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes ma'am
[Nagisa] Okay.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh I see. So you'd like to start
up the Drama Club again?

00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:08.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, we'd like to take part
in the School Festival.

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:11.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have enough members.
Now all we need is an advisor

00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:14.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
and the student council will
recognize us as a real club.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're desperate. Will you please
be our advisor, sir?

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:22.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well there's a junior at this
school named Rie Nishina,

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
that'll you'll need to settle
things with first.

00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:26.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
Rie Nishina, huh?

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:30.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean the same Rie Nishina
who lent us the violin?

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:35.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Ichinose.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello, Nishina. Nice to see you.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't seen you in awhile.
Do you need something?

00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:45.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm fine actually.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
But my friend Nagisa here needs
to talk to you.

00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:52.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi, I'm Nagisa Furukawa from
class 3-B.

00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:56.507 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Um, but to tell you
the truth, I'm not exactly sure
what's going on either.

00:04:56.607 --> 00:05:00.509 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sorry, but if you don't mind,
could I talk to her alone for
a sec?

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.946 position:5% line:77% align:start
I mean, I'm sure Nishina
and her friends don't
feel comfortable

00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:06.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
with all these seniors barging
in all of a sudden.

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:20.891 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] How did it go, Nagisa?

00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:22.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well you see...

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:23.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Harada] What are you going
to do, Rie?

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:26.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remember we were the ones who
approached Mr. Koumura first,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you don't need to back down
if you don't want to.

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:33.868 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah but Mr. Koumura was
originally the advisor
to the Drama Club.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:38.270 position:5% line:77% align:start
Also this is the last chance for
the seniors to form a club
before they graduate.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah but what'll happen
to the Choir Club?!

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.809 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't tell me you're gonna just
give up singing because of
something stupid like this!

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Rie] Of course not, but why
don't we try to come up with

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
a solution where everyone
can be happy?

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:51.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:05:52.347 --> 00:05:53.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Choir Club?

00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:56.852 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, Nishina and her friends
say they want to form
a Choir Club

00:05:56.952 --> 00:06:00.187 position:5% line:77% align:start
and the problem is they've
already asked Mr. Koumura
to be their advisor.

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:05.058 position:5% line:77% align:start
Isn't that kind of weird though?
Is the advisor of the Choir
usually a music teacher?

00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:08.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well usually but in this case,
I heard that the music teacher

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:09.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
has her hands full with the
brass band.

00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:13.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
And unfortunatly Mr. Koumura is
the only teacher on campus

00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:14.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
who isn't already an advisor.

00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:16.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
What a pain. So what's
the plan now?

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:20.301 position:5% line:77% align:start
Come on, don't tell me you're
gonna give up with out
a fight, Nagisa?

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
[door opens]
[Misae] Is Sunohara here?

00:06:25.773 --> 00:06:28.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Actually he hasn't
come back yet.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:30.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well he has a call from his
little sister.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.611 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you're not busy you think you
could talk to her and pass the
message on?

00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh that's right, he does have
a little sister, doesn't he?

00:06:36.147 --> 00:06:39.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well if she takes after her
brother she's probably like,

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:42.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Hi Youhei, it's me!"

00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:45.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
Scary huh? Like something
out of a horror flick.

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:47.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] Would you mind not
scaring my cat?

00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:50.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
[babbling incoherently]

00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:51.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Wh..What?!

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess she speaks human
language after all.

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:56.961 position:5% line:77% align:start
[cat meows]
[Mei] Hello? Was that
you, Youhei?

00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:59.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah that's right, I'm your
brother, Youhei Sunohara,

00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:02.566 position:5% line:83% align:start
the biggest stain on your
otherwise picturesque existence.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:04.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] What are you
talking about?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess nothing phases her. Huh?
[cat meows]

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:10.205 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] Anyway, I was thinking
about coming to visit you the
day after tomorrow.

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:11.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] If that's okay?
[Tomoya] Sorry, Sis.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But I'm actually
in jail right now.

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:16.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
I messed up and got arrested.
Better luck next time.

00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:19.778 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] There you go again, trying
to avoid me. I'm coming
for sure.

00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:22.814 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] What do you want
me to bring you?
[Tomoya] A Dogu statue.

00:07:22.914 --> 00:07:25.782 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] You really want
something like that?
[Tomoya] Yeah, totally.

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:28.652 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mei] Well, if you're sure
that's what you want,
then I'll bring you one.

00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:31.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] Wait, hold on a
second. This is fun and all

00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:33.955 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] but you really can't
tell I'm not your-
[Mei] Oh, Mom's calling, so I'd
better go.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] Remember the day after
tomorrow, okay?

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] See you then!
[Tomoya] Hey! W-Wa...

00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:38.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait! Hello?

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.326 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, heck.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, what's done is done.

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
[cat meows]

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:48.166 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Man, I can't believe
you guys had the nerve to go
home without me.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.969 position:5% line:77% align:start
When I came to the school
was empty and all the
lights were off.

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:56.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was hungry so I was about to
go home but then I found out
the gate was locked...

00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:58.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki, you listening?

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:04.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Hey Nagisa,
what you reading?

00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:06.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me,
it's a love letter?

00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:09.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's see...

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:13.584 position:5% line:77% align:start
"Forget the Drama Club and
quit while your ahead before
you get hurt."

00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:15.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
They sent you a threat?!

00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:21.090 position:5% line:77% align:start
I came back to class after
P.E. and found it stuffed
inside my desk.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I have no idea who
put it there.

00:08:23.024 --> 00:08:25.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well it's gotta be the Choir
Club, since they're the ones

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:28.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're having the whole
advisor dispute with.

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:31.164 position:5% line:77% align:start
No way! You can't just blame it
on them when you don't even
have any proof!

00:08:31.264 --> 00:08:35.700 position:5% line:77% align:start
Nishina wouldn't-  Rie and her
friends wouldn't do something
like that.

00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:37.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
They just want to be able
to sing together, that's all!

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:41.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're not bad people at all,
I just know it!

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:46.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, they lent their violin
to Kotomi and everything.

00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:48.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
So they can't be bad.

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:51.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess we'll just have
to find out.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:52.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
You got something in mind?

00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:54.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I have a way of finding
out the truth.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll have a report for you
by the end of the day.

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:57.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
So look forward to it, alirght?

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-Hey, hold on a sec!

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:01.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I won't rough them
up or anything.

00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:05.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't make it a habbit
of picking on girls.

00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:06.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
It just doesn't seem right.

00:09:07.023 --> 00:09:10.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't think Nishina would
do something like that, do you?

00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:16.429 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Turns out it was
someone from the Choir
Club after all.

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:17.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
A girl named Sugisaka.

00:09:17.664 --> 00:09:18.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have proof that
it was her?

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:20.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
One of her classmates caught
her in the act.

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:22.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
They said they saw her walk
into a senior classroom

00:09:23.068 --> 00:09:25.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
and put something inside
one of the desks.

00:09:25.304 --> 00:09:27.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't lie about
something like that.

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:31.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, look here's our
criminal right now.

00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:35.211 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Guess she's punctual
if nothing else.

00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you came alone,
I'm impressed.

00:09:37.946 --> 00:09:41.447 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sugisaka] It was my idea.
I decided to send the letter
on my own.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nishina didn't have anything
to do with it.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
I take full responcibility.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
You girls are seriously out of
touch with reality, aren't you?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.657 position:5% line:77% align:start
Do you honestly think we're
gonna but the whole "sefless
sacrifice" routine?

00:09:52.757 --> 00:09:54.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara, wait.

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:56.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Please let me
handle this!

00:09:58.961 --> 00:10:02.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
I met you yesterday in the music
room, with Nishina.

00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:04.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can we please talk this over?

00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:08.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sugisaka] You might not
have heard, but Nishina has been

00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:10.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
playing the violin ever since
she was a little girl.

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:14.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's done recitales, won
competitions and everything.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.441 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eventually people started
recognize her talent,

00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:20.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
and she decided she wanted
to study abroad.

00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:23.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then something
unthinkable happened...

00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:26.447 position:5% line:89% align:start
She had an accident.

00:10:27.515 --> 00:10:30.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
After that her grip got weaker,

00:10:30.351 --> 00:10:35.688 position:5% line:77% align:start
she tried to play, but she
just couldn't do it the way
she use to.

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:40.490 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was after that when she
came to this school, she
always so sad.

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:44.428 position:5% line:77% align:start
And that'd the reason we
formed a Choir Club becase
we didn't want her to give up!

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:48.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe she can't play the violin
anymore, but she can still sing.

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nishina's a really great
singer too!

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:54.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm begging you! Please don't
take that away from her!

00:10:56.803 --> 00:11:00.706 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] I...
[Youhei] Don't listen to that
crap, Nagisa!

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:04.176 position:5% line:77% align:start
People who try to get your
sympathy with sob stories
like that

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:05.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
are nothing but cowards!

00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:09.212 position:5% line:77% align:start
You think people should just get
their way because they have
a handicap?

00:11:09.313 --> 00:11:10.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not that easy!

00:11:10.612 --> 00:11:12.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sugisaka crying]

00:11:13.082 --> 00:11:14.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara...

00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:17.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
Handicap my ass!

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I don't want to hurt
Nishina and her friends.

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:28.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you haven't done
anything wrong!

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just forget about what she
said and move on!

00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:32.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I can't.

00:11:32.863 --> 00:11:35.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because now I know the truth.

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:41.169 position:5% line:77% align:start
The Choir Club isn't like us,
they're acutally serious
about music and singing.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
But the Drama Club is...

00:11:44.372 --> 00:11:48.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Listen Sugisaka,
I'll give up on the Drama Club.
[Sugisaka] Furukawa I...

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.145 position:5% line:77% align:start
So tell Nishina I want her to
make the Choir Club the
best she can.

00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:57.781 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara!

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:05.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara
is just like me.

00:12:05.887 --> 00:12:07.855 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was recruited by a school
sports team,

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:10.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
but was forced to quit part way
through the season.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
He never said anything.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:13.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
He use to be on the soccer team,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
but after he got in a big fight
with one of the upperclassmen

00:12:16.462 --> 00:12:18.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
the coach forced him
to quit the team.

00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:23.733 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now he's just like me, all he
and I ever do these days is just
sit around and waste time.

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:24.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really had no idea...

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:27.236 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know how he feels.

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:30.705 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's hard to just give up on
something you've wanted
for so long.

00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:32.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's probably why he can't
forgive people who take

00:12:32.706 --> 00:12:35.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
advantage something
like a disability.

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:39.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, are you really sure this
is what you want?

00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:44.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagiza] Okazaki...

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:45.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What is it?

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:47.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Even if this is where
it all ends,

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:50.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had so much fun working
together with you.

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:53.321 position:5% line:77% align:start
We may not have been able to
start up the Drama Club like
we wanted.

00:12:53.422 --> 00:12:57.958 position:5% line:77% align:start
But along the way I feel like I
found so many things that are
more important than that.

00:12:58.059 --> 00:13:01.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, you and I became good
friends because of all this.

00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:06.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now Kyou, Ryou, Kotomi and
Sunohara are all my friends too.

00:13:06.298 --> 00:13:10.700 position:5% line:77% align:start
To tell you the truth, I never
though that someone like me
could come this far in life.

00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:13.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
I owe it all to you, Okazaki.

00:13:13.103 --> 00:13:15.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't say that.
I haven't done anything.

00:13:15.604 --> 00:13:17.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now you're just being modest.

00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:19.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you've just gotten stronger,

00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:22.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're not the same girl I met
at the bottom of the hill.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.679 position:5% line:77% align:start
You may be a crybaby and you may
be clumsy but you've still made
it this far.

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:28.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I think you've
gotten stronger.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.050 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] But if you weren't here
with me, I don't think I could
have done anything.

00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:41.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
I was trying not to cry.

00:13:41.623 --> 00:13:42.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:56.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] HEY, YOU TWO!

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:58.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Youhei told me what happened!

00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:00.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
You got pulled into some stupid
sob story from the Choir Club

00:14:00.904 --> 00:14:03.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
and gave up Mr. Koumura
as an advisor!

00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:05.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why can't you stand up for
yourself for once?!

00:14:05.374 --> 00:14:07.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you keep giving in to every
little demand like that,

00:14:08.043 --> 00:14:10.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'll never make your
dreams come true!

00:14:11.979 --> 00:14:13.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] This just doesn't seem
right to me.

00:14:14.047 --> 00:14:16.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
If Nagisa's too kind hearted,
then I'll just have to take out

00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:19.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Choir Club with my
own two fists!

00:14:19.284 --> 00:14:20.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
You gotta be kidding me.

00:14:20.718 --> 00:14:22.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really think doing that
would make Nagisa happy?

00:14:22.887 --> 00:14:23.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
[frustrated yell]

00:14:23.887 --> 00:14:26.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
This sucks! Come on Okazaki,

00:14:26.423 --> 00:14:27.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
let's go blow off some steam!

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
Normaly I'd say yes, but I just
emptied out my savings

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:33.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
trying to fix up Kotomi's yard.

00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:36.096 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] It's good to see
you here again, Okazaki.

00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:39.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on a second.
What's going on here?

00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:42.201 position:5% line:77% align:start
Their coffee tastes great,
it's always nice quiet and
everything's free.

00:14:43.236 --> 00:14:44.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not a bad hang out, huh?

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:46.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, my name
is Yukine Miyazawa.

00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:50.740 position:5% line:77% align:start
I guess you could say I'm
the keeper of the "second
library" here at school.

00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:53.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't that kind of pointless?

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:55.878 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] I mean, why would you
want to have a library full of
books nobody reads?

00:14:55.978 --> 00:15:01.282 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, just because people don't
read them doesn't mean they're
not interesting.

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:04.451 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take this one for example.

00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:06.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
I love reading
people's horoscopes.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you tell me your
sign, Sunohara?

00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:11.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's see what the stars have
in store for you.

00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:13.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you can use that thing
to tell the future,

00:15:13.558 --> 00:15:16.692 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't you tell me how to get
the advisor from the Choir Club?

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
It says here that orange
is your lucky color.

00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:21.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your lucky word for this
month is basketball.

00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:23.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
Basketball's lucky, huh?

00:15:23.498 --> 00:15:26.033 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sounds like you're reading
Okazaki's fortune instead
of mine.

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
You are a kind person who
cares for his friends.

00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:31.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those around you are touched by
the earnestness of your actions.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.139 position:5% line:77% align:start
While you may feel that
your efforts are made in
vain, in actuality,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.042 position:5% line:77% align:start
many people are moved by
your will to challenge
the impossible.

00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:41.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
Will to challenge the
impossible, huh?

00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:44.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lucky word is basketball?

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:45.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's it!

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:46.714 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Sunohara.

00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:48.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
Later, Okazaki!

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
That idiot, what's he up to now?

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I don't care how many
times you ask me.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Judo girl] Please don't
say that.

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:57.256 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, Sakagami. You gotta
join the women's Judo Club.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.292 position:5% line:77% align:start
As captain of the men's
Judo Club, I'd like to
second her request.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:03.360 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you join, then our women's
club will become a national
contender.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've told you a thousand times,
I'm not interested.

00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:09.031 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Hi Tomoyo, looks like
you're popular as ever.
[Tomoyo] Okazaki, help me
out here.

00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:11.699 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Judo girl] Just come and watch
us practice, okay?!
[Tomoyo] These guys just won't
leave me alone.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:13.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Judo Boy] Just for today,
that's all I ask!

00:16:13.734 --> 00:16:14.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Judo Girl] Please,
I'm being you!

00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:16.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't! I have things to do!

00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:18.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey...

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fuko-chan at your service!

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:30.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sakagami, for coming to my
sister's wedding,

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:34.617 position:5% line:77% align:start
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Now allow to be of service in
your time of need.

00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:37.952 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have no choice but to summon
the power of my ultimate
technique

00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:41.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
the "starfish heat"!
Prepare yourself!

00:16:41.488 --> 00:16:46.858 position:5% line:77% align:start
But wait you two from the Judo
Club also came to my sister's
wedding! That's no good!

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:50.696 position:5% line:83% align:start
Forgive me. In a case like this
I can't take either side.

00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:53.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
Still I would like to appear
again some day!

00:16:53.464 --> 00:16:55.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
Until then... Thanks a lot.

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mind telling me what
that was about?

00:16:58.467 --> 00:16:59.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:01.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Judo Girl] Anyway, please come
to our practice.

00:17:01.704 --> 00:17:03.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just give us a chance,
you'll see.

00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:05.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] All right, you
two, that's enough.

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:06.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Judo Boy] Who the heck are you?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's go, Tomoyo.
[Tomoyo] Uh, right.

00:17:13.578 --> 00:17:15.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] I'm impressed. When
push comes to shove, you
don't back down.

00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:19.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to make such
a big deal out of it.

00:17:19.282 --> 00:17:21.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this is the Judo Club
we're talking about.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.119 position:5% line:77% align:start
And not just members either,
those two were the team
captains.

00:17:24.219 --> 00:17:25.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really weren't
scared at all?

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm used to people hating me.
Don't worry about it.

00:17:28.822 --> 00:17:32.359 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you hadn't come, they might
have kept pestering me until
I joined.

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:34.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
The thing is, I don't have any
interest in judo,

00:17:34.694 --> 00:17:39.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
and I'm going to be busy with
the student council election
soon anyway.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, I wish you luck
in the election.

00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:45.469 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you were president it'd be
a lot easier to reestablish
the Drama Club.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:17:48.237 --> 00:17:49.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. I was just thinking that

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:51.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're a nice guy, that's all.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:01.113 position:5% line:77% align:start
Really? So you haven't seen
Sunohara since he ran off
yesterday?

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:04.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, he didn't come back to the
dorm till really late at night.

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:09.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
Knowing him, he was probably
up to no good.

00:18:12.521 --> 00:18:14.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
About time you showed up.

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:16.157 position:5% line:89% align:start
Challenge the basketball team?

00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:17.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hold on a sec!
What made you come up

00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:19.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
with a crazy idea like that?

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:21.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remember what Yukine
told me yesterday?

00:18:21.662 --> 00:18:24.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
Many people are moved by my will
to challenge the impossible,

00:18:24.996 --> 00:18:27.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that my lucky word this
month is basketball.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.467 position:5% line:77% align:start
In other words! If we play a
game of basketball against the
school team and win,

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:35.004 position:5% line:77% align:start
then I can prove my point
to those crybabies from
the Choir Club.

00:18:35.104 --> 00:18:36.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to show them that
handicaps don't matter.

00:18:36.739 --> 00:18:39.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
And then, just like the
horoscope said,

00:18:39.775 --> 00:18:42.610 position:5% line:77% align:start
they'll be so moved by my
actions, they'll give up
their advisor.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.313 position:5% line:77% align:start
That kind of hare-brained plan
might work in an after school
special or something,

00:18:46.413 --> 00:18:48.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I doubt anyone would
actually fall for it.

00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:52.517 position:5% line:77% align:start
Listen, I know you can't shoot,
but if you're the point guard
you should do fine.

00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:54.719 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Come on!
[Tomoya] I don't have
time for this.

00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:56.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Nagisa.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:58.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki! Wait!

00:18:59.623 --> 00:19:01.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
I feel kind of bad.

00:19:01.123 --> 00:19:03.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
Was it okay to leave Sunohara
behind like that?

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:06.860 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't take it seriously. He's
always freaking out about
stuff like this.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.532 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I feel bad for ignoring him
because he's doing all this
for me.

00:19:12.632 --> 00:19:15.833 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>I guess it's kind of out of</i>
 <i>character for him to help</i>
 <i>people out.</i>

00:19:15.933 --> 00:19:18.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki!
Let's play basketball!

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:19.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki!

00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:20.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's play basketball!

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:21.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah come on, Okazaki!

00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's play!
Come on, let's play!

00:19:22.807 --> 00:19:24.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know you want to do it.

00:19:24.741 --> 00:19:25.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt,

00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:28.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
but Sunohara is disrupting
my studies!

00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:33.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Wait up, Okazaki!

00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:36.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh hi, Okazaki, let's go
to the club...

00:19:36.282 --> 00:19:37.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Run away!
[Nagisa] Huh?!

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:43.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Good, he won't be able
to find us here.

00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:45.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who won't be able to find us?

00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:47.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
You weren't running away from
Sunohara are you?

00:19:47.924 --> 00:19:49.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nothing, forget about it.

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:52.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
But...

00:19:52.294 --> 00:19:54.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] All right, I'll tell
you the truth.

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:56.930 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Uh-huh?
[Tomoya] He's just using this
whole basketball thing

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
as an excuse to spend
time with me.

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:00.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] An excuse?
[Tomoya] That's right.

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
I didn't want to tell you this,

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:02.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
but the truth is he really
likes me.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's totally in love with me.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki...

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.672 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:20:07.772 --> 00:20:09.807 position:5% line:77% align:start
Lately, I've been too wrapped up
in other things to pay much
attention to him.

00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:13.109 position:5% line:77% align:start
So he keeps cooking up all these
ridiculous plans to bring us
closer together.

00:20:13.209 --> 00:20:16.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess it's kind of pathetic in
a way, if you think about it.

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:19.714 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] B-But if he loves you
so much, maybe you should
consider his feelings.

00:20:19.814 --> 00:20:24.250 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's not his fault, but
unfortunately, I'm just
not into guys.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.018 position:5% line:77% align:start
And since I can't return his
love, the sooner he gives
up on me,

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:29.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
the less heartbreak he'll
suffer in the end.

00:20:29.287 --> 00:20:33.624 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh I see... that's so nice of
you to consider his feelings
like that.

00:20:33.724 --> 00:20:35.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm glad you
understand.

00:20:37.494 --> 00:20:39.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! There he is!

00:20:39.895 --> 00:20:41.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Finally caught up with you!

00:20:41.563 --> 00:20:44.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, why are you running
away like that?

00:20:44.365 --> 00:20:45.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're so-

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:47.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, I'm sorry but you
shouldn't...

00:20:47.634 --> 00:20:50.302 position:5% line:77% align:start
I mean, Okazaki doesn't like
that so you have to
respect that.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:53.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki and I are good friends.

00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:54.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the big deal?

00:20:54.807 --> 00:20:56.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, I know, but even
with friends,

00:20:56.141 --> 00:20:57.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
there's a line you can't cross.

00:20:57.509 --> 00:20:59.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I'm afraid you're just gonna
have to give up.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:02.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't give up! I need him more
than anything!

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:04.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I don't have him then all
of this is pointless!

00:21:04.814 --> 00:21:05.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you can't!

00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:07.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can't, because...

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:10.584 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, because Okazaki's
my boyfriend!

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:12.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Gah!
[Youhei] AH!

00:21:12.753 --> 00:21:13.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
W-What I mean is,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
no matter how much
you care for him

00:21:15.288 --> 00:21:18.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't let you take Okazaki
from me. So um...

00:21:18.223 --> 00:21:20.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Is she trying</i>
 <i>to protect me?</i>

00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
So that's it. Since when?

00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:27.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
[crying] HOW COULD YOU?!

00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:34.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei sobbing dramaticly]

00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:35.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey...

00:21:35.736 --> 00:21:36.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:21:36.737 --> 00:21:38.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just wanted protect you,

00:21:38.104 --> 00:21:40.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
so out of the blue,
I told this rediculous lie.

00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:42.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I didn't think he would
react like that.

00:21:42.775 --> 00:21:44.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! No, uh...

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Actually, thanks,
that made me happy.

00:21:48.512 --> 00:21:49.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Huh?

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.451 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Uh, excuse me...

00:21:55.551 --> 00:22:00.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
That boy running away, do you
know if that Youhei Sunohara?

00:22:00.187 --> 00:22:02.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
And who are you?

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:06.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name's Mei Sunohara,
I'm Youhei's little sister.

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:08.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Wha?
[Tomoya] Huh?!

00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:44.396 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoyo] So does that mean
you're going out with someone
right now or what?

00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:46.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No way! Why are
you asking me this?

00:23:46.732 --> 00:23:49.367 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] By the way, you said
something interesting back
in the classroom.

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:52.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Me? Sunohara and Tomoyo
we're the interesting ones.

00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:54.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I said interesting
not annoying.

00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:56.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, you said you don't have
a girlfriend, right?

00:23:56.171 --> 00:23:59.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Come on, Kyou,
what are you getting at here?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Oh nothing. You'll just
have to wait and see.

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:05.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Nagisa, Okazaki!
What are you doing in my room?!

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:08.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah! No way! You aren't turning
this into your love nest!

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:11.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh! No!
That's not it at all!
