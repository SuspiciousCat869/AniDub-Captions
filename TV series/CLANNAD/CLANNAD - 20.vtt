00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:07.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
[single note]

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:13.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hi, Okazaki...

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:14.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's up? Is something wrong?

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:17.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You weren't around,
so I went looking for you.

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:21.733 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't tell me you've been
practicing for the play in a
place like this every night.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not every night.
I can't really practice at home,

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:28.776 position:5% line:77% align:start
because if I sing or raise
my voice it'll bother
the neighbors.

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:30.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right,
but try to be careful.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's dangerous to
be in a place like this alone.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's right by my house.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:36.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Even if something
did happen,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
all I'd have to do is scream
and Dad will come running.

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:42.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, but you're kind
of dense, so I worry soemtimes.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? I don't really seem
that dense, do I?

00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:47.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I thought
it was obvious.

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:49.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm really shocked.

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.674 position:5% line:77% align:start
[sigh]
You get depressed
way too easy.

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not so bad.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
[giggle]
It was a joke.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:00.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've gotten used to it already.
All your teasing, I mean.

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:03.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
When you put it that way,
it makes me feel kind of guilty.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, sorry, I guess
I should watch what I say.

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine. Actually,
please don't change.

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:10.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
I like you just the way you are.

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:13.802 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No problem.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:19.944 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you decide on what
play you want to do?

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:22.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the same one I wanted
to do before.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.651 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't know the title, but
it's a story I heard when
I was young.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] So, what's it about?

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:34.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's a story about
a girl who lives all alone,

00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:36.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
because she's the
last person alive.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.738 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Nagisa] Nothing dies, and
nothing is born in the world.

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:44.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a tragic fantasy
on a cold winter's day.

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:26.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] It's done.

00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:59.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] I'm sorry.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] I'm sorry...

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffling]

00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:12.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>A young girl living</i>
 <i>in a world that has ended...</i>

00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:15.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Somehow I feel like I've</i>
 <i>heard of that before...</i>

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:17.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>No, I'm sure of it.</i>

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I just can't remember</i>
 <i>when and where.</i>

00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:25.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] I'm useless! Nothing
but a burden to the Bakery!

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] But I love your bread!

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:33.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
Argh, I screwed that up.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:35.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh?
What is it this time?

00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:37.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I was recommending
Sanae's bread

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:39.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
to one of our customers
and she said it was inedible.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae overheard
it and got upset.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
We call this one a rainbow roll.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
Feel the rainbow!

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm not really
sure what that means.

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:54.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] A girl living in a world
that has ended...?

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nope, sorry, but I'm afraid
that doesn't ring a bell.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Could you try a little
harder to jog your memory?

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:03.508 position:5% line:77% align:start
Like, did you ever read Nagisa
a fairy tale like that when
she was little?

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:06.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm... Nope, don't remember.

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:08.449 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Why don't you ask Sanae?

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see. All right then.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Hey, kid.
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:17.627 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't know what you're up to,
but to tell you the truth,
I don't like the sound of it.

00:05:17.727 --> 00:05:21.866 position:5% line:77% align:start
So, listen, if you find
out something strange,
don't tell Nagisa.

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:23.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Run it by me first.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:24.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why should I?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just do it.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] No, I don't remember
anything like that at all.

00:05:31.713 --> 00:05:34.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, can you try to think
back a little bit?

00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:35.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
It might not be a storybook;

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:37.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
it may have been
something on TV.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
It might help if you told
me how the story ends.

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:44.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa said it was
a tragic fantasy,

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:47.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I'm thinking it might
not have a happy ending.

00:05:47.132 --> 00:05:49.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
A tragic fantasy, huh?

00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:52.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't think of anything.

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:54.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, tragedies aren't really
my specialties,

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:58.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I can't imagine
I told any to Nagisa.

00:05:58.147 --> 00:06:01.051 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] It might be something
she heard at school or
somewhere else.

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:06:03.388 --> 00:06:05.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] I'm sorry, is it
something important?

00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:07.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, kind of.

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess.

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:11.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Something important?</i>

00:06:11.298 --> 00:06:14.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I don't know why, but somehow</i>
 <i>I get the feeling it is.</i>

00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:17.774 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, just because I don't
remember it, doesn't mean
she never read it.

00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:21.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe it's still lying around
the house somewhere, tucked
away in a corner?

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:23.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
You could also look
at the school library.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks, that's a good idea.
I'll try it.

00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:37.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I don't think
we have a book like that here.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.604 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yukine] We don't have many
children's books or
picture books.

00:06:40.704 --> 00:06:43.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a high school library,
so I guess that's no surprise.

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:46.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yukine] We have quite
a collection of plays
and drama videos

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:49.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
for high schoolers, though.
Do you think that might help?

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:53.922 position:5% line:77% align:start
I appreciate it, but I don't
think it was originally a play
or a performance piece.

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] I see.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
But hey, Yukine! Help me out.

00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:00.064 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm looking for a spell that
can tell me which girl has
a crush on me.

00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:01.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you think you can show me?

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
Geez, we were talking about
something serious here.

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've got just the spell.

00:07:05.938 --> 00:07:07.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Whoa! For real?!

00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:08.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Ta-da!

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:10.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
First you form
a little heart shape

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
with your thumbs and index
fingers, just like this.

00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:16.518 position:5% line:77% align:start
After that, repeat "She loves
me, she loves me not,"
three times in a row.

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:23.929 position:5% line:77% align:start
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me, she loves me not.

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:25.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Kay, now what?

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:27.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the last part of the spell
to work, all you need to do

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:29.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
is take a quick walk
around the campus.

00:07:29.737 --> 00:07:32.907 position:5% line:77% align:start
The first girl who talks to you
after that is the one who
likes you.

00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:34.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Woo! Awesome!

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:37.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here I go! Ha ha!

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:39.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey...
[Yukine] Yes?

00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:42.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] If there's a guy
and he likes a girl,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
do you think she would
like him to tell her?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, you mean like
you and Furukawa?

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.396 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I-I never said that...

00:07:49.496 --> 00:07:51.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Naturally,
if the feeling is mutual,

00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:53.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
then the girl would
be happy to hear it.

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
However, keep in mind the timing
is an important factor as well.

00:07:56.806 --> 00:08:01.512 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you're too sudden or too
forceful, it can cause her
feelings to change.

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:03.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
So that's how it is, huh?
[door opening]

00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:07.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] How did it go?

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
Leave me alone...

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] How many times
did you run around?

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.459 position:5% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even after all that, not a
single girl said a word to you?

00:08:15.898 --> 00:08:18.168 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:20.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on, let me get
you some water.

00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:21.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Alright, Okazaki.
Now it's your turn.

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:28.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm supposed to do it too?

00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:31.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
Form a heart with your fingers,
just like this.

00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:34.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright, but let's make
this fast.

00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:36.357 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, Sunohara, move.

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.594 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh-

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ssh!

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:46.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>It's nothing personal,</i>
 <i>but somehow I feel like</i>

00:08:46.872 --> 00:08:50.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>you're the last person I should</i>
 <i>get romantically involved with.</i>

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Listen, there's a big
bear that eats little girls

00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:56.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
prowling around
the school right now.

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:59.555 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you want to make it out
alive, then act like you're
dead and don't say a word.

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:01.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just pretend you're
a zombie, okay?

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:02.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Mmhmm.

00:09:04.028 --> 00:09:06.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
[zombie sounds]

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh man, that was a close call.

00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:12.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!

00:09:12.472 --> 00:09:14.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were late, so I came
looking for you.

00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:16.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are standing here
in the hall?

00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:19.249 position:5% line:89% align:start
U-Uh, well, I... I...

00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:21.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] She loves me,
she loves me not.

00:09:21.152 --> 00:09:23.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now just go outside. Start
walking around the campus.

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:26.958 position:5% line:77% align:start
The first girl who stops and
talks to you, has a crush
on you.

00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:29.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Okazaki?

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:31.397 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's nothing.

00:09:31.498 --> 00:09:33.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
Looks like everyone's here, now.

00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:37.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I heard this story
a long time ago,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I don't remember the name
and I don't remember

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:43.446 position:5% line:77% align:start
if it was a picture book
or something someone told
me or what.

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:47.786 position:5% line:77% align:start
But anyway, the story is about
a little girl who is all alone
in the world.

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:51.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
It is very lonely for her.
Very sad and very difficult.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:55.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] There's nothing and
no one else in the world.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
But one day, the little girl
decides to create a friend.

00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:03.440 position:5% line:77% align:start
So she puts together a bunch
of odds and ends and makes
a mechanical doll.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.581 position:5% line:77% align:start
And then, as if answering the
girl's wishes, the doll begins
to come alive.

00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:11.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
At long last, the girl's
loneliness goes away.

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:13.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Now I'm sure</i>
 <i>I've heard it before.</i>

00:10:16.725 --> 00:10:19.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Come, look! You won't
believe what I just found!

00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:22.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What is it?
[Nagisa] Isn't it cute?

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:26.338 position:5% line:77% align:start
Back when I was in elementary
school, I used to have this
charm on my school bag.

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:28.875 position:5% line:77% align:start
[singing]
Dango, dango, dango, dango...
[sigh]

00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:31.111 position:5% line:77% align:start
Aren't you a little old
for that sort of thing?
[continues singing]

00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:34.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Hey! Who's singing that
embarrassing song in my shed?

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:37.219 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Your daughter,
that's who.
[Nagisa] We're looking
for something.

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:41.625 position:5% line:71% align:start
I thought I might be able to
find some old picture books
or fairy tales I read when
I was little.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.362 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Trust me, there aren't
any picture books in there.

00:10:44.462 --> 00:10:46.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows what will turn
up if we look hard enough.

00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:47.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not there, okay?

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
So just get back to making
out in the bedroom

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:51.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
or whatever you kids
do these days.

00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:55.377 position:5% line:77% align:start
[gasp]
What am I saying?!
I can't encourage that!

00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:57.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
Calm down. You're the one
who said it, not me.

00:10:57.712 --> 00:10:59.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Just get out
of there already!

00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:00.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on! Move it!

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What do you
want with me?

00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:04.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just listen.
What I'm about to tell you

00:11:04.722 --> 00:11:06.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
is not for your ears,
not Nagisa's.

00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:08.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
And since this is a
man-to-man conversation,

00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:11.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want you telling Sanae
about this either.

00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:14.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] It would only stir
up old memories.

00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:15.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's fine.

00:11:15.304 --> 00:11:17.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sigh]
Some tea would be nice.

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:20.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Sanae, bring us some tea,
will you, please?

00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:22.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Okay!

00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:25.383 position:5% line:77% align:start
Damn, I forgot we were
supposed to keep this
a secret from Sanae!

00:11:25.482 --> 00:11:29.188 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Akio] Argh!
[Tomoya] I think you need
to take your brain in for
some repairs.

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:33.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Man, that was close.

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:35.063 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, we're safe now.

00:11:35.163 --> 00:11:36.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
To tell you the truth, kid...

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Here's your tea.

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:39.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:41.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] You have some
too, Okazaki.

00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:42.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Thanks.

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:43.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
[slurp]

00:11:43.975 --> 00:11:47.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yup, if you're Japanese,
it's got to be tea.

00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:48.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now I'll say it one more time,

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:50.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
keep this a secret from
Sanae and Nagisa.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
What secret are you
keeping from me?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guh! You're standing
right there?!

00:11:54.888 --> 00:11:56.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
After you finish your tea,
I'll go back inside,

00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:58.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you can have your
secret man talk.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
You heard her, kid,
now hurry up and drink!

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.568 position:5% line:77% align:start
[chugging]
Are you doing this on purpose
or are you just stupid?

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:07.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Alright, now we can
finally talk in peace.

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:10.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the one who was making
it difficult in the first place.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you ever find what you
were looking for?

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:15.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, no, not yet.
[Akio] I see.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, don't get me wrong,
it's not like I cared in
the first place.

00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:23.593 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm not interested in digging up
the old potty Nagisa used for
toilet training.

00:12:23.694 --> 00:12:25.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
You say it like I am.

00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:27.165 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah? Seemed like you were
looking pretty hard to me!

00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:29.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, for a picture
book, not a training potty!

00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:32.873 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Hey, you two! It's late,
so keep your voices down.

00:12:32.973 --> 00:12:34.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't want to trouble
the neighbors.

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, whatever, let's just
forget about the potty.

00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:38.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the one who brought that
crap up in the first place.

00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:42.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah? Well from now on, our
code name is "training potty!"

00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:43.186 position:5% line:89% align:start
How do you like that?

00:12:43.287 --> 00:12:44.822 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fine, whatever you want.

00:12:44.922 --> 00:12:46.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good, then let's move on.

00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:48.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatever you're looking
for isn't really the issue.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was just a little worried that
you might find something else

00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:53.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
while you were
digging around out there.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Something else?
[Akio] You want to know?

00:12:55.537 --> 00:12:57.605 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, not if you don't
want to tell me.

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine, I'll tell you.
If you don't know the truth,

00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:03.580 position:5% line:77% align:start
you'll probably just think
I have an ass-load of porn
magazines hidden out there.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Now you're just putting
ideas in my head.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, those things we've got
piled up back there in the shed,

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:10.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
all of it, they're all pieces
of our past.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:14.228 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Akio] Old photos and diaries,
that kind of stuff.

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:18.534 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] Things to remind us of
the days when we were young
and chasing our dreams.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
But why is it a problem
if we see that?

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Let me explain.
We don't talk about this much,

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:26.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
but when Nagisa was little,
she almost died.

00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:30.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
She was face to face with death.

00:13:30.216 --> 00:13:32.419 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a close call.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.988 position:5% line:83% align:start
It all happened about
ten years ago.

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:36.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae was a middle
school teacher,

00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:40.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I was finally able
to follow my dream, too.

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:42.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
We had a busy life,
but a happy one.

00:13:42.432 --> 00:13:43.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Your dream?
What was that?

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] That's got nothing
to do with this story.

00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:51.544 position:5% line:77% align:start
The only thing you need to know
is that we were both focused
on our careers.

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:53.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Too focused, actually.

00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:57.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
The truth is, we hardly ever
found time to spend with Nagisa.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, it all started when
Nagisa came down with a fever.

00:14:01.824 --> 00:14:04.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a cold, snowy day.

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:07.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, the day care
center was closed at the time,

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:11.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
and we couldn't find anyone
to babysit either.

00:14:11.237 --> 00:14:14.275 position:5% line:77% align:start
Even though our daughter was
sick, it was a busy time for
both of us,

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:18.580 position:5% line:77% align:start
and regardless of the
circumstances, we couldn't
take off work.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
At that point, her temperature
had come down,

00:14:20.782 --> 00:14:25.322 position:5% line:77% align:start
and I figured I could go home
as soon as I finished my work
for the day.

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:27.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was just two hours...

00:14:27.258 --> 00:14:29.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just two short hours.

00:14:29.428 --> 00:14:30.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
But...

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa had gone outside
to wait for us to come home.

00:14:38.206 --> 00:14:42.145 position:5% line:77% align:start
I thought that God must
be punishing us for being
so selfish.

00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:44.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was taking Nagisa away
because we were too busy chasing

00:14:45.082 --> 00:14:47.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
our dreams to worry
about our own child.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there are plenty
of people in this world

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:55.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
who can balance their careers
and their child,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
but we couldn't.
We had to make a choice.

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:05.175 position:5% line:77% align:start
When Nagisa opened her eyes
again, the two of us made
a pledge:

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
we promised that we'd always
be by her side.

00:15:08.447 --> 00:15:12.085 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] So, we both changed
careers and decided to start
a bakery together,

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:15.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
since Sanae was so confident
about baking bread and all.

00:15:15.155 --> 00:15:17.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Course you can imagine
how that turned out.

00:15:17.258 --> 00:15:20.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, if I wanted to survive,
I had to learn the trade myself.

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:23.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
It wasn't easy. We were always
in and out of debt,

00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:25.802 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I can't say it wasn't fun.

00:15:25.902 --> 00:15:29.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you don't want Nagisa
to find out? Why not?

00:15:29.274 --> 00:15:31.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because knowing her,
she'll think it was her fault.

00:15:31.477 --> 00:15:35.683 position:5% line:77% align:start
She'll think she's the reason
why Sanae and I had to give
up on our dreams.

00:15:35.782 --> 00:15:37.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I'm not sure,

00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:39.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
but somehow I have this
really bad feeling,

00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:41.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
like something happened
when I was little.

00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:43.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
It might not be my fault,

00:15:43.627 --> 00:15:46.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I feel like I must've done
something really bad to them.

00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:50.035 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] Eventually, Nagisa
started to suspected that
something was wrong.

00:15:50.135 --> 00:15:53.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, we put all of our
mementos into storage.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:55.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
Digging up all this crap
is hard enough on me.

00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:58.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just imagine how sad
it would make Sanae.

00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:01.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know, but I still think
you should tell Nagisa.

00:16:01.116 --> 00:16:03.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
It might be tough at first,
but she deserves to know,

00:16:03.653 --> 00:16:06.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I'm sure she has the
strength to deal with it.

00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:08.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Maybe so, but if we just
break it to her out of the blue,

00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:12.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
then it'll come back
as a pretty big shock.

00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:15.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
But some day,
when the time is right,

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:16.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll tell her everything.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] But that's the
truth for you.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's always harsh, isn't it?

00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:26.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
Attention, please!
It's time for a quiz!

00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:30.121 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've been planning something
very special for Sunday, which
is tomorrow, by the way.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:32.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what do you think it is?

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Number one: a picnic...

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:34.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
Number two: pick-pick...

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
Three: picric acid!

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:38.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on, I don't understand
the last one.

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:41.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
Picric acid is a
chemical compound.

00:16:41.169 --> 00:16:43.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's yellow, highly aromatic,
and explosive.

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:47.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see. That's neat. Guess you
learn something new every day.

00:16:47.344 --> 00:16:49.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Alright, Nagisa,
what's your answer?

00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:52.151 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right! I choose picnic,
number one!

00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.589 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wrong! The correct answer
is number two: pick-pick!

00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:58.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tomorrow, we'll have fun
pick-picking all day.

00:16:58.827 --> 00:17:02.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, you and I can still go
on a picnic if you'd like, okay?

00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:04.567 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] Huh?! Wait!
That's not fair!
[Nagisa] Okay!

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't leave me out!

00:17:06.537 --> 00:17:10.040 position:5% line:71% align:start
[arguing]
Hey, is it okay if we forget
about Drama Club just
for tomorrow,

00:17:10.142 --> 00:17:11.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
and have a little fun instead?

00:17:11.878 --> 00:17:13.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sounds good to me,

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:14.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
we could use a break every once
in a while.

00:17:14.882 --> 00:17:16.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Yeah!
[Sanae] By the way, Okazaki,

00:17:16.784 --> 00:17:19.187 position:5% line:77% align:start
would you mind telling me
what kind of food you like
to eat?

00:17:19.287 --> 00:17:21.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to pack something
that you'll enjoy as well.

00:17:21.524 --> 00:17:25.395 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Sure.
[Akio] I want to eat apple
slices cut up to look
like rabbits!

00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:28.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
No fair, Dad, who said you
got to go first?

00:17:28.232 --> 00:17:30.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, I'd like to request
hamburgers, please!

00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:33.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I want some
deep-fried shrimp!

00:17:34.808 --> 00:17:39.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>I wonder if this is</i>
 <i>what a normal family is like?</i>

00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:43.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Somehow, I don't think I should</i>
 <i>go with them tomorrow.</i>

00:17:44.387 --> 00:17:47.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I wonder what Dad's</i>
 <i>doing right now?</i>

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:56.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyuh! Who's in my bed?!

00:17:56.269 --> 00:17:58.206 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who do you think? It's me.

00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:01.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki,
what are you doing here?

00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:04.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nothing really, but what are
you doing up so early?

00:18:04.314 --> 00:18:07.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Actually,
I'm about to go to sleep.

00:18:07.485 --> 00:18:08.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
Picnic, huh?

00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:11.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, that's not
really your style, is it?

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not at all. I figure if I went,

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
it would just put a damper
on their family get together.

00:18:16.897 --> 00:18:18.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] But isn't Nagisa
expecting you?

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:21.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
She'll be disappointed,
won't she?

00:18:21.102 --> 00:18:23.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
I left a note, so I'm sure
she'll be fine.

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:26.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
"I have an errand to run, so
please go without me," it says.

00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:28.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but this is Nagisa
we're talking about here,

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:31.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she's going to imagine
the worst case scenario.

00:18:31.517 --> 00:18:34.554 position:5% line:77% align:start
At least she'll think you feel
uncomfortable staying
at her house.

00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:35.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you think?

00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:37.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on,
she's not that sensetive.

00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:39.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's just a stupid little
picnic after all.

00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:44.000 position:5% line:77% align:start
You ought to know that Nagisa
has no confidence when it
comes to these things.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's always worried.

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] At least, that's what
it seems like to me.

00:18:48.071 --> 00:18:51.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe before, but she told
me she's been more
confident lately.

00:18:51.744 --> 00:18:53.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] That's just because
you've been around.

00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:56.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're always scolding her
and egging her on.

00:18:56.283 --> 00:18:58.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why she's able to take
on different challenges.

00:18:58.653 --> 00:19:01.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why she feels
more confident now.

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:03.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but that's
a good thing, right?

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:05.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Of course it is!
That's what I'm saying!

00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:07.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
Think about this for a second.

00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:10.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's gained confidence because
you've been around to help.

00:19:10.435 --> 00:19:12.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, if you suddenly turn
your back on her,

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:15.207 position:5% line:77% align:start
what do you think will happen
to all that confidence she's
built up?

00:19:15.308 --> 00:19:17.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa doesn't realize
how you feel about her.

00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:19.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, it's easy for her
to get the wrong idea.

00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.152 position:5% line:77% align:start
You don't even think about
it, but if you keep acting
so wishy-washy,

00:19:23.252 --> 00:19:25.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're really going to hurt her.

00:19:25.154 --> 00:19:27.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
First you ran away from
your dad's house.

00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:29.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then you run away from
Nagisa's house, too.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now you come running here
and expect me to put you up?

00:19:32.397 --> 00:19:35.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fine. If you really don't
want to go to the picnic,

00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:37.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd be more than happy
to tag along in your place.

00:19:38.072 --> 00:19:41.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
And hey, if I'm lucky, love will
blossom between Nagsia and I.

00:19:43.178 --> 00:19:44.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
[tink]

00:19:44.447 --> 00:19:46.282 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm leaving.

00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:48.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry I bothered you.

00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:50.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
[door opening and closing]

00:19:51.489 --> 00:19:52.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
[yawn]

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] That's it for me.

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa!

00:20:01.637 --> 00:20:04.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki!
I was looking for you.

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:06.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
I left you a note,
did you get it?

00:20:06.342 --> 00:20:08.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh, note?
I didn't see any note.

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:10.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where have you been
all this time?

00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:12.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
We were starting to get worried.

00:20:12.517 --> 00:20:14.587 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, you got
my note, right?

00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:16.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but I cooked it up
and ate it for breakfast,

00:20:16.957 --> 00:20:18.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I never read what it said.

00:20:18.793 --> 00:20:19.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why did you...?

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:21.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to play baseball,

00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:23.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it's getting
kind of late now.

00:20:23.164 --> 00:20:24.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, it's just-

00:20:25.035 --> 00:20:27.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're going to have to make up
for keeping us waiting all day.

00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:29.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] And you can start
by coming with us.

00:20:30.007 --> 00:20:30.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:32.209 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:38.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
Am I on a roll today, or what?

00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:40.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you see that, Sanae?

00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:42.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
You fall in love with me again?

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:46.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep, again and again!
You're the best.

00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:49.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course I am!

Okazaki, I helped Mom make all
the food, so I hope it's good.

00:20:56.476 --> 00:20:57.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it a try, okay?

00:20:57.912 --> 00:20:58.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:21:03.852 --> 00:21:05.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Tastes great.

00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:06.689 position:5% line:89% align:start

[cheering]

00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:28.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
You see that, Nagisa?

00:21:28.318 --> 00:21:30.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep, wouldn't miss
it for the world!

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:31.890 position:5% line:83% align:start

[Akio] Stop making me wait!
[Nagisa] What? You mean
I have to play, too?

[kid] Alright!
[Tomoya] Go for it, Nagisa!

00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:53.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
[kid] Come on! Come on!

[gasp]

00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:58.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
[kid] Wow!
[Tomoya] Nice hit, Nagisa!

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:01.863 position:5% line:89% align:start
Run for it, Nagisa!

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:04.967 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Ye...

00:23:48.538 --> 00:23:51.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] This is a world that
has come to an end.

00:23:51.108 --> 00:23:55.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
An empty and still world
where no one exists but I.

[Nishina] It's not like being
alone at home or school,

00:24:03.758 --> 00:24:05.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're really completely
alone in the world.

00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:08.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a very oppressive sadness,
don't you think?

00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:11.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's very
lonely and sad.
