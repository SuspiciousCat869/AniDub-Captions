[Tomoyo] Those in agreement,
raise your hands.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:11.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then it's settled, as decided
by majority rule,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.454 position:5% line:77% align:start
both the Drama and Choir
clubs will have Mr. Koumura
as their advisor

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
and are hereby sanctioned
for club activities.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
You finally pulled it off!
Nice work.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:27.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on the revival
of the club, Nagisa.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
I made plenty of food so we
could celebrate together.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:39.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much for your
help, everyone.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
I couldn't have done
it without you.

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:44.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, I did help out
a lot, didn't I?

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:45.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
And what exactly did YOU do?

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:47.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] You don't remember the
basketball game?!

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:50.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I helped Tomoyo with her
election too! That was all me!

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so lucky to have good
friends like you to support me;

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
without your help, I couldn't
have accomplished anything.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
I really can't thank you enough.
You guys are the best.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.461 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Anyway, we can't sit
back and relax now.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.331 position:5% line:83% align:start
We still have the School
Festival before summer break.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was the whole reason we
were doing this, right?

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't think it's too late
for that now?

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:13.638 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We've come this far.
Why hesitate now?

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:14.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki...

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:17.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said that was your
dream, right?

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:18.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now you can make
it come true.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is no time to give up!

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.247 position:5% line:77% align:start
You have to stand up and
seize this opportunity
while you can.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:36.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's true, isn't it? I have to
give it my best, no matter what.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Home visit?

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Yes, I'm going
to see your father today

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
to discuss your future.

00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's all right, really.

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
No! This is important.

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:19.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
Especially considering your
recent suspension.

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:21.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your father should be home
right now, correct?

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:25.587 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well it's kinda hard to say.
Sometimes he's in, and
sometimes he isn't.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's alright with me, I'm
willing to take a chance.

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait here for a minute
while I get ready.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] What's up, Okazaki?

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there something wrong?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nevermind me.
What are you doing here?

00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:45.238 position:5% line:77% align:start
I thought maybe I could get some
advice from Mr. Koumura about
the club.

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:47.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now we've got to practice
non-stop!

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.442 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't you come join us?

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure everyone would
be happy to see you.

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:52.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I don't care about
that kind of stuff.

00:03:53.013 --> 00:03:54.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:58.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Wait! What about all
those things you said

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
back in the club room?

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:01.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said to seize the
opportunity and

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.221 position:5% line:89% align:start
make my dreams come true!

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
Y-You really gave me
a lot of confidence.

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you
didn't mean it!

00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:09.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We can talk some
other time, okay?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki! Wait!

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:13.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Why are you
following me?!

00:04:13.764 --> 00:04:17.233 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Because I'm worried
and I want to know where
you're going!

00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:25.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
[PA Speaker] Tomoya Okazaki of
3-B, Tomoya Okazaki!

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come to the office immediately!

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm not gonna run away
so stop pulling me, all right?

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:36.151 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] No way.
[Tomoya] Give me a break,
Nagisa. Don't you trust me?

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.853 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Nope!
[Tomoya] You didn't have to
think about that one much.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:42.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, Okazaki, but you have
a tendency to lie.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:47.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
[teacher laughing]

00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:48.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now that's a funny picture,
isn't it?

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:52.198 position:5% line:77% align:start
Never thought I'd see you
getting ordered around
by a girl!

00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:54.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sounds a lot worse when you
put it like that.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:57.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a bit strange, since he's
usually ordering ME around.

00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:00.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hm. Okazaki's pretty mellow
now that you're here.

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey listen, would you mind
coming with us?

00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:08.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
So Okazaki doesn't run away?

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:11.149 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Sure. I'd love to help
out in anyway I can.
[Tomoya] Huh?!

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.818 position:5% line:77% align:start
But- But I thought you said you
needed to talk to Mr. Koumura
about the club?

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I forgot, I guess that's
important too.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jeeze! Slacking off
already, huh?

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] I can't believe the
way he talks to you.

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:24.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
How can you put up with that?

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:28.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
You get used to it after
a while.

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:29.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] So it's just been you
and your dad living together

00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:32.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
since you were real young,
you said?

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah...

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Wow, that must have
been hard on him.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Raising a little trouble maker
like you all by himself, I mean.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Too bad.
Looks like he's out.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well what can you do? Guess
I'll just have to wait inside.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.052 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] But wait!
[Teacher] It's part of being
a teacher.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:55.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll wait here till tomorrow
morning if I have to.

00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:57.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:00.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
I..I'll go look for my
dad, o-okay?

00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki! Wait!

00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:05.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
[frustrated groan]

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Maybe I can hide out</i>
 <i>at Sunohara's.</i>

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:17.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki?

00:06:21.143 --> 00:06:22.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You ran away,
didn't you?

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:24.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh... Aren't you
suppose to be at practice?

00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:27.249 position:5% line:83% align:start
It turned out that Mr. Koumura
couldn't make it,

00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:29.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we all decided to call
it a day early.

00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:33.353 position:5% line:77% align:start
You left your bag in the club
room, so I was going to your
house to return it.

00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:37.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Stay close to me,
I'm keeping an eye on you.

00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:45.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] I'm not sure really.
What did Tomoya have to say?

00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:48.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Uh, I believe there's
been a misunderstanding.

00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:52.904 position:5% line:77% align:start
I haven't spoken to Tomoya yet,
of course I'm going to discuss
the matter with him as well.

00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:55.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I wanted to speak to you
about it first.

00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:58.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
I understand, but I'm afraid
that's not my decision to make.

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] Tomoya is Tomoya,
after all.

00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:02.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
He can decide on his own.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.681 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] But he's still just
a student, Mr. Okazaki.

00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
For now at least, his guardian

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.618 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] should also be...
[Naoyuki] No, Tomoya is Tomoya.

00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:10.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] My opinion on the
issue doesn't matter.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:22.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, now you
know what he's like.

00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:27.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
As far as he's concerned, I'm
not even his son anymore.

00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:28.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
I told you what happened, right?

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
We got in a big fight and I hurt
my shoulder,

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's why I can't play
basketball anymore.

00:07:34.507 --> 00:07:37.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
After that, everything changed.

00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:41.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're like strangers. We stopped
being family ages ago.

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:45.285 position:5% line:77% align:start
We may live under the same roof
but our lives are completely
seperate.

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:47.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
Completely unconnected.

00:07:47.286 --> 00:07:51.990 position:5% line:77% align:start
He still keeps a smile on his
face but I know he's all alone
in the world.

00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:58.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
Umm, I have an idea.

00:07:58.829 --> 00:07:59.829 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:05.534 --> 00:08:08.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you like to stay at my
house for awhile?

00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:10.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:14.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, only if it's not any
trouble or anything.

00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:16.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, no, no trouble at all.

00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought, for awhile at least,
it might be better

00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:21.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
to put some space between
you and your dad.

00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:24.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens
you're still family.

00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:27.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're apart, I know
you'll miss each other.

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:31.892 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then, bit by bit, you'll
remember the things you
loved about eachother,

00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:37.563 position:5% line:77% align:start
and the next time you meet,
you'll be able to talk things
out. Without all the bitterness.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:45.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
But still, I'm worried about
your dad.

00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Even if it doesn't look like it,

00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:51.909 position:5% line:83% align:start
he's been living alone for
a long time now.

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:53.844 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh I see.

00:08:53.944 --> 00:08:56.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you should visit once
in a while.

00:08:56.747 --> 00:08:59.083 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, once in a while, I guess.

00:09:08.724 --> 00:09:11.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>This was the house I always</i>
 <i>returned to,</i>

00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:13.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>but it's different now.</i>

00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:17.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>This time, I may never</i>
 <i>come back.</i>

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:21.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Or maybe someday I can</i>
 <i>return here for good.</i>

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:25.839 position:5% line:77% align:start
[TV] Imagine finding dishes made
with such fresh ingredients so
close to home?

00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:27.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TV] This restaurant truly
is a treasure!

00:09:27.874 --> 00:09:30.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TV] And not only is the food
a treat to eat,

00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:32.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TV] the owner is rather
charming as well.

00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:34.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TV] Even if you're only
stopping in for an appetizer,

00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:38.584 position:5% line:77% align:start
[TV] having the chance to meet
her is well worth the trip,
I assure you.

00:09:38.684 --> 00:09:41.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TV] I'm coming back during
summer break with my family.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
[TV cuts off]

00:09:42.054 --> 00:09:43.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:49.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
[footsteps]

00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:54.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] Tomoya, are you going
somewhere again?

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:56.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Just to a
friend's house.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Naoyuki] That's an awfully
big bag.

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:01.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] They're putting
me up for a while.

00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:03.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't decided when
I'll be back.

00:10:05.573 --> 00:10:08.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see, it'll be lonely
without you.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.614 position:5% line:77% align:start
Even if we didn't speak much
I was always happy to have
you around.

00:10:12.714 --> 00:10:15.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I have my reasons
for this.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
Try to understand.

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll so my best.

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:19.987 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, see you later.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
Goodbye, Dad. So long.

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:48.711 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Hello?
[Akio] What do you want barging
in at this time of night?

00:10:48.813 --> 00:10:51.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Wait, didn't Nagisa tell her</i>
 <i>parents yet?</i>

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:52.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you ain't got business
here, get out.

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:54.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've got a lot of work to do.

00:10:54.717 --> 00:10:56.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is Nagisa here?

00:10:58.054 --> 00:11:00.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Hi, Okazaki. Come on in.

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:03.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
From today on, you'll be part
of the family.

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:06.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, I'll try my best.
Thanks for having me.

00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:09.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Thanks for having you?
What's he talking about?

00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:11.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Tomoya has some
things he needs to work out

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:13.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
so he'll be staying here with
us for a while.

00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:15.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh is that so?!

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:17.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa told us about it
earlier. Don't you remember?

00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:19.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course I do.

00:11:19.973 --> 00:11:21.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] You knew all along?

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:21.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:11:22.075 --> 00:11:24.111 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you know, this is no good.

00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh? What do you mean?

00:11:25.312 --> 00:11:27.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
I won't be the only man of the
house anymore.

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:30.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just want to feel special,
that's all!

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't mind him, Tomoya. He just
gets worked up sometimes.

00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:35.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go on upstairs.

00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:36.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes, ma'am.

00:11:37.088 --> 00:11:39.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't get too comfortable
around here, you little punk!

00:11:39.457 --> 00:11:42.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
There there, let's calm down and
get back to work, okay?

00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:45.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
Welcome home, Okazaki.
I've been waiting for you.

00:11:47.064 --> 00:11:49.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure I can stay in such
a nice room?

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:51.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's our guest room.
That's what it's for.

00:11:53.604 --> 00:11:55.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bedding is here
in the closet.

00:11:55.238 --> 00:11:57.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're not use to sleeping
on a futon,

00:11:57.106 --> 00:11:59.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can lay it out and
make it up for you.

00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:02.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now it's all right, really,
I can do that much.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just don't leave them on the
floor all day.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, you're quite the busybody,
aren't you? I never knew.

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:08.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way! I am not!

00:12:08.983 --> 00:12:11.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have my own problems
to worry about.

00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:15.356 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, but that's doesn't stop
you from worrying about other
people's problems too.

00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:17.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah, I guess.

00:12:17.724 --> 00:12:19.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Seconds please, Sanae.

00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:20.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure!

00:12:21.693 --> 00:12:23.296 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, thanks for the bath.

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure, bet it felt nice, huh?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you like to have some
tea with us?

00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:28.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, thank you.

00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:34.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
For some reason I still
can't calm down.

00:12:34.872 --> 00:12:36.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess I'll get used to it.

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:41.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're leaving now,
see you later.

00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:44.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, have a nice day
at school.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:47.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to tell her goodbye
too, Okazaki.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Really?

00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:49.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. I'll see you later.

00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:54.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have a nice at school.

00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:56.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Dad, I'm going
to school.

00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:58.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] All right.
Be careful, okay?

00:12:58.427 --> 00:12:59.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Kay. Now it's your turn.

00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:01.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh. Okay.

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:03.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm going to school now.

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:06.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right! You go get 'em, kid!

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:08.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Get what?</i>

00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:09.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That was kind
of embarrassing,

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
but your parents were so
natural about it,

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:14.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I guess I shouldn't
feel too bad.

00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:16.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's fun walking
to school together.

00:13:17.043 --> 00:13:18.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm use to being alone.

00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:20.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now I'm still
too embarrassed.

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:24.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
[giggles] To be honest, I'm a
little embarrassed myself.

00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:28.220 position:5% line:77% align:start
But since I met you, I've grown
more confident about a lot
of things.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.122 position:5% line:77% align:start
So a little embarrassment
doesn't bother me so much
anymore.

00:13:31.223 --> 00:13:34.959 position:5% line:77% align:start
Starting today I'm gonna give
it my all and make sure the
School Festival turns out great.

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:37.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyay] All right.
That's the spirit!

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:39.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
You bet! [giggles]

00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:48.304 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mr. Koumura] The art crew will
be responsible for the costumes
and props.

00:13:48.404 --> 00:13:50.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
The sound crew will handle the
music and sound effects.

00:13:50.707 --> 00:13:54.943 position:5% line:77% align:start
And last but not least, the
light crew will handle the
stage lighting.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.713 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] It's sounds
complicated. Really complicated.

00:13:57.812 --> 00:13:59.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I guess we better
assign tasks to everyone.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you handle
the sound, Ryou?

00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:04.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, you were the sounding
board for Kotomi's jokes, right?

00:14:05.086 --> 00:14:07.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like this will be
a big undertaking.

00:14:07.255 --> 00:14:09.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now remind me, what are you
doing here again?

00:14:09.756 --> 00:14:11.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was worried about the
Drama Club, of course.

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:14.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
What'd you expect? It's my job
as student council president.

00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:16.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
When it comes to lightning,
and sound

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
the level of difficulty will
depend on the play you choose.

00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:23.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
For example, if there's a lot of
fast paced action going on

00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:26.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
then operating the switches
might be a bit more complicated.

00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:29.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
As for sound effects our
keyboard should be fine.

00:14:29.707 --> 00:14:31.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
This keyboard here?

00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:34.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Suspence.

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:37.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
[suspencful sound effect plays]

00:14:37.347 --> 00:14:38.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! That's awesome!

00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give me a break. This isn't
a game, you know.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:43.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aw c'mon, I just want
to try one!

00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:46.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's that you say, Nagisa?

00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:47.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?

00:14:47.822 --> 00:14:49.358 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it true?

00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:51.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
You like me more than Okazaki?!
[suspencful sound effect plays]

00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:52.961 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait- wait what?!

00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:54.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Alright, I understand.

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:56.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let us live together deep in the
forest where no one can find us.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.670 position:5% line:77% align:start
And so the fated lovers joined
hands and run into the misty
sea of trees.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
But! Standing behind them
[suspenceful sound effect plays]

00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:06.407 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] was Okazaki crazed
with anger!
[Tomoya] Heh.

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.941 position:5% line:83% align:start
And standing before them
baring their fangs

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:12.612 position:5% line:77% align:start
were a pair of vicious harpies,
Kyou and Tomoyo!
[suspenceful sound effect plays]

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:14.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was just a joke. They didn't
have to punch me.

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:21.720 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Don't cry. I thought
your little solo performance
was a lot of fun, Sunohara.

00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:23.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa?
[Nagisa] Yes?

00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:25.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
A long time ago, you said there
was some play you wanted to do.

00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:29.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's it like? Or can you tell
me the name at least?

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:34.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
Acutally, I'm not exactly sure.

00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:37.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me get this straight,

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:38.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
you know what play you want to
do for the festival,

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:40.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
but you don't remember the title

00:15:40.303 --> 00:15:42.739 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that why you couldn't tell
me what it is?

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:44.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:47.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hi guys, I'm home from school!

00:15:47.376 --> 00:15:48.510 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm home too.

00:15:50.044 --> 00:15:52.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's all this?

00:15:52.648 --> 00:15:56.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
These kids are students of
the Furukawa Tutorial School.

00:15:56.384 --> 00:15:57.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Furukawa What?

00:15:57.685 --> 00:15:59.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who's that?
He's not our teacher.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! Don't mess with my stuff!

00:16:02.824 --> 00:16:03.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:05.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh oh! Natchan's in trouble!

00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:09.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh no!

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae claps for attention]

00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:15.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, everyone,
let's begin class.

00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:16.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kids] Okay!

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.106 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sorry, Tomoya, but I'm afraid
this was the only room I
could us.

00:16:21.206 --> 00:16:25.075 position:5% line:77% align:start
So I guess this mean you
hold an after school
tutoring class?

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:27.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Yes!
[Kid] Come on, Ms. Furukawa,

00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:28.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
forget about that loser already!

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:30.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
And let's start class

00:16:30.414 --> 00:16:32.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
What did you just
call me, punk?!

00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:33.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki...

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everyone, you should treat your
elders with respect.

00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:37.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
And never call them losers.

00:16:37.886 --> 00:16:39.222 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kids] Yes ma'am!

00:16:43.358 --> 00:16:45.994 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akip] Hey, punk, if you've got
free time, then help out in
the shop.

00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:50.565 position:5% line:77% align:start
Or rather, why don't you take
care of the shop, so I can have
some free time.

00:16:50.665 --> 00:16:52.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] It's always busy in the
mornings and evenings.

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:55.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bread I bake is pretty
popular, you know.

00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:59.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But what about Sanae?
Is she okay?

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:02.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
I doubt she'll ever improve, but
we still have some kind hearted

00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:03.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
customers who will buy her
bread out of pity.

00:17:04.077 --> 00:17:06.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't mean her bread,
I mean her class.

00:17:07.012 --> 00:17:09.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Handling kids
can be really tough.

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:13.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's nothing to worry
about, really.

00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:14.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what she was trained
in after all.

00:17:15.086 --> 00:17:18.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
Awhile back she even use to
teach in a middle school.

00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:21.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No kidding? Huh.

00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:23.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well then why'd she
stop teaching?

00:17:23.494 --> 00:17:26.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, things just
happen sometimes.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Man I'm exhausted.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Can I come in?

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure go ahead!

00:17:46.915 --> 00:17:48.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you need something?

00:17:48.383 --> 00:17:50.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, I just wanted
to say hi.

00:17:50.785 --> 00:17:53.922 position:5% line:77% align:start
It feels kind of strange,
having you staying in
my house like this.

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:57.825 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's gonna take a little getting
use to but I'm glad I can stop
by like this.

00:17:57.925 --> 00:18:01.194 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah but you guys are used
to having guests staying
over aren't you?

00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:02.895 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean Mei was just here.

00:18:02.995 --> 00:18:05.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure I guess so, but at the
same time

00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:07.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's something
special about you.

00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:13.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I can go away if I'm
getting on your nerves.

00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:16.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm happy to have you.

00:18:16.207 --> 00:18:18.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just... How do I put this?

00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:20.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
It feels kinda strange
to me too.

00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:23.948 position:5% line:89% align:start
Strange? In what way?

00:18:24.047 --> 00:18:28.918 position:5% line:77% align:start
Uh, well, for almost as far back
as I can remember, I've never
had a mom around the house.

00:18:29.018 --> 00:18:30.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
On top of that you've seen
what my dad is like.

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:34.590 position:5% line:77% align:start
Suddenly being part of a
close-knit family feels
kind of strange.

00:18:34.691 --> 00:18:37.025 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:38.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I understand.

00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:43.231 position:5% line:77% align:start
My mom and dad dote on me so
much that it makes me feel a
bit guilty sometimes.

00:18:47.635 --> 00:18:52.572 position:5% line:77% align:start
Still, after all these years,
I haven't been able to
apologize to them.

00:18:53.607 --> 00:18:56.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it. Did you do
something wrong?

00:18:56.175 --> 00:18:57.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I'm not sure.

00:18:57.978 --> 00:19:00.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
But somehow I have this
really bad feeling,

00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:02.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
like something happened
when I was little.

00:19:02.815 --> 00:19:08.052 position:5% line:77% align:start
It might not be my fault, but I
feel like I must have done
something really bad to them.

00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:09.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm sure it's just
your imagination.

00:19:09.554 --> 00:19:13.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Mom and Dad both say the
same thing about it.

00:19:13.156 --> 00:19:16.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bring it up and they always
change the subject.

00:19:16.628 --> 00:19:19.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
But no matter what they say, I
know they're hiding something,

00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:23.099 position:5% line:77% align:start
because whenever I mention
it, Dad get really nice all
of a sudden.

00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:25.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
They have to be hiding something
and whatever it is

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:29.405 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like it must be something
I need to apologize for.

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:32.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something you need to apologize
for? Like what?

00:19:32.975 --> 00:19:34.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:37.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
That way I can apologize.

00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:44.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know.
It's always on my mind.

00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:50.056 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry, I shouldn't bother
you with all this stuff it's not
really your problem.

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:53.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it.
We're friends, aren't we?

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Right!
[Sanae] Okazaki,
the bath is ready.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:03.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you, but I think I'm gonna
take my bath a bit later.

00:20:04.068 --> 00:20:05.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
You go ahead and take
yours first.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:08.372 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you don't mind I think
I'm gonna go see how
Sunohara's doing.

00:20:08.472 --> 00:20:12.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
He get lonely if I don't stop by
to visit everyonce in a while.

00:20:12.376 --> 00:20:16.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see. In that case,
say hi for me

00:20:16.146 --> 00:20:18.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
and try not to come
back too late.

00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:22.117 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't think there's any place
in the world where I feel more
at ease.

00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:23.019 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tea, please!

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:24.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah right, you wish.

00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:26.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
But what about dinner?

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
You didn't bring anything
to eat this time.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nope, I actually had a real
dinner this time.

00:20:30.526 --> 00:20:34.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Ohoho. You mean
at Nagisa's house?

00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:36.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. How'd you know about that?

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're one lucky little bastard,
you know that?

00:20:38.433 --> 00:20:41.435 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well you might think
so, but it's kind of
uncomfortable really.

00:20:41.535 --> 00:20:43.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad
they're putting me up,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
but for some reason I just can't
feel at home there.

00:20:46.707 --> 00:20:51.044 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hold on a second! Are you trying
to tell me that you're living
with Nagisa?!

00:20:51.143 --> 00:20:52.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oops... Uh oh.

00:20:56.382 --> 00:20:58.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! I can't even look at you!

00:20:58.249 --> 00:20:59.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Augh, it's not
like that!

00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:01.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just staying at their house.

00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:02.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa knows I don't get along
with my old man,

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
so she was just being
considerate when she invited me.

00:21:04.923 --> 00:21:08.492 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're living with her, what
kind of idea did you expect
me to get?

00:21:08.592 --> 00:21:10.160 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have her parents approval.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, I told you it's not
like that!

00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:13.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're just doing me a favor!

00:21:13.797 --> 00:21:15.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
Man, you've got some nerve.

00:21:15.264 --> 00:21:18.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
How can you still be talking
like that even now?

00:21:18.201 --> 00:21:19.836 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know what you're
getting at here.

00:21:19.936 --> 00:21:24.406 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] [sighs] Man, what
a shame. I really feel sorry
for Nagisa.

00:21:33.714 --> 00:21:38.419 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>[Voice] One day, I gathered</i>
 <i>together a bunch of odds</i>
 <i>and ends</i>

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:41.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>and tried to make another doll</i>
 <i>like me.</i>

00:21:41.187 --> 00:21:43.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] I see. So you want
a friend?

00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:48.895 position:5% line:77% align:start
That only makes sense.
You must be lonely all
by yourself. Right?

00:21:48.995 --> 00:21:50.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:51.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>[Voice] That's not quite it.</i>

00:21:51.864 --> 00:21:54.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It's not so much that I'm</i>
 <i>lonely really,</i>

00:21:54.967 --> 00:21:59.504 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>it's just that I thought it</i>

00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:05.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Girl] Then let's try,
even if it's impossible.

00:23:42.328 --> 00:23:44.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Hmm. Nope,
don't remember.

00:23:44.296 --> 00:23:45.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't you ask Sanae?

00:23:46.031 --> 00:23:47.566 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I see, all right then.

00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:51.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Hey, kid.
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:23:51.237 --> 00:23:52.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I don't know what
you're up to,

00:23:52.337 --> 00:23:53.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
but to tell you the truth,

00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:54.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't like the sound of it.

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:57.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
So listen, if you find out
something strange

00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:59.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
just run it by me first.

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:00.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why should I?

00:24:00.444 --> 00:24:01.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just do it.

00:24:02.012 --> 00:24:03.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:24:04.047 --> 00:24:07.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] Somehow, I don't think</i>
 <i>I should go with them tomorrow.</i>
