[voice] <i>I was born</i>
 <i>into this world</i>

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:18.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>in my search for this girl,</i>

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>sacrificing life, a new world,</i>

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:24.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>and everything</i>
 <i>I could have had.</i>

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.305 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>The girl collected pieces</i>
 <i>of junk from somewhere,</i>

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>and made a body for me.</i>

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>My memories were murky.</i>

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:51.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I couldn't remember</i>
 <i>without effort.</i>

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Where had I been?</i>

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Where had I been</i>
 <i>trying to get to?</i>

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] Good job!

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
[voice] <i>I couldn't speak</i>
 <i>to the girl,</i>

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:17.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>but she was the one warm spot</i>

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:21.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>in this world that</i>
 <i>I had been after.</i>

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Of course, in my body of junk,</i>

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I cannot feel that warmth.</i>

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Welcome!

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, so it's just you.

00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:10.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I'm not here
to buy anything.

00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:13.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's confusing every time you
come in the store, you deadbeat.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.811 position:5% line:77% align:start
Next time, come in on all
fours so I'll know you're
not a customer.

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:18.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
How's Nagisa?

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:19.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there any change
in her condition?

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:20.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know you came all this way,

00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:21.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I'm afraid she's sleeping.

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:23.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
We need to let her
get some rest.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
But listen, Romeo, sorry to say,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
she hasn't been calling your
name in her delirium,

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.486 position:5% line:89% align:start
so don't get all puffed up.

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't ask you if she
was calling my name.

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] If she's said
anything, it was,

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Oh, Dad, I love you.
You're the coolest ever!"

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:40.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
and "You and pretty Mommy
make the best couple!"

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Don't make
me act ridiculous!

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:42.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're doing it on your own!

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:43.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't need my help!

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:44.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Mr. Okazaki...

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:47.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't be here to visit
Nagisa by any chance?

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes, I heard
that she's bedridden.

00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:53.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not really, she just has
a slight fever.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:55.743 position:5% line:89% align:start
But she...

00:03:55.843 --> 00:03:59.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] I'm afraid Nagisa has
never been a strong child.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was out of school for
a long time last year.

00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:04.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, our family
pediatrician told us

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
that she needed to get rest
today, as a precaution.

00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:08.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Is that right?

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.821 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, and thank you.

00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:12.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because you were kind
enough to carry her home,

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:13.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
she's going to be all right.

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:14.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot, kid.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it was really the
least I could do.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
[rustle]

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:20.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here's a bag of Sanae's
pastries, take them.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.166 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Akio] Consider them a thank you
gift for all your kindness.

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:25.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
I didn't come here for that.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:26.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't need a
thank you present.

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it!

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, there's no way
these donuts debacles

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
are going to sell toda- er...

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
My homemade pastries...
How could you?

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.945 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] They're just access
baggage at the Furukawa Bakery,
aren't they?!

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I love them, baby!
They're good!

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:45.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, judging from that, I guess

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's nothing to worry
about now, is there?

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:48.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Excuse me...

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
Where are the owners?

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:52.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believe they just stepped
out for a minute.

00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:57.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can have these, if you want.

00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:58.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you sure it's all right?

00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:00.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, I got them for free
of charge, actually.

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:02.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you. You're so kind.

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if you would please thank
Mr. and Mrs. Furukawa for me,

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:05.967 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'd be very grateful.

00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:11.539 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>She's really pretty...</i>

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:22.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>She knew she was sickly,</i>
 <i>that idiot.</i>

00:05:23.816 --> 00:05:24.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] You! You!

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
You there...
C-Come with me a minute!

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] Just look at
that dent, will ya?!

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know that some construction
tool caused this.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'm going to need
you to be my witness.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.961 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Be your witness?
[Yoshino] I don't think
it's a good idea

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
to get someone
who's not involved.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
[man] But without a witness,
you'll just drive off, right?

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:46.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll say it again, I did not
drop any tool on your car.

00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:48.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino] If I did,
I would never cover it up.

00:05:48.937 --> 00:05:50.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
And why should I believe you?!

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino] If you want me to pay
for repairs, I'll do it.

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:55.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
Haha! So, you admit it?

00:05:55.408 --> 00:05:58.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I don't admit anything.
I just want one thing, man.

00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.147 position:5% line:77% align:start
I want you and your friend
here to think about what
I said someday,

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:02.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the very near future.

00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:05.249 position:5% line:83% align:start
If what the electrician told you
that day was true,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
or was it false?

00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:08.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino] Think about
it in your place of rest,

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
beside the one you love.

00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:12.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
What the hell is this
guy talking about?

00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:13.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't ask me. I think he's nuts.

00:06:13.824 --> 00:06:15.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino] Listen carefully,
my friends.

00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:17.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
Every day, people keep
hurting each other.

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:20.295 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's no wonder that you doubt
what other people in the world
tell you.

00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:22.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
But when you're no longer able
to believe in anything,

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:24.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
you will not be able to feel
the love in others.

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:26.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you content going through
hardships all alone,

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
living an empty life?

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:29.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you able to laugh at life?

00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:31.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, can you
laugh freely, man?

00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:33.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, I guess I can.

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:35.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yoshino] I see...

00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:38.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well then, I would assume
you are probably loved.

00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:42.047 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then go with peace and live
your life with strength so that
your love will never die.

00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:46.451 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Boy, this guy can</i>
 <i>say such hammy lines with</i>
 <i>such conviction.</i>

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:53.223 position:5% line:89% align:start
Say... I think it was a cat.

00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:56.959 position:5% line:77% align:start
[man] A cat?!
[Tomoya] If you look at it
from this angle... See there?

00:06:57.927 --> 00:06:59.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:00.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
[defeated sigh]

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think that a cat probably
jumped down from the wall

00:07:02.764 --> 00:07:05.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
and dented your car, man.
A fat cat.

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
[low meow]

00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:16.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks a lot, pal. You were
a really big help to me.

00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:19.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was no big deal, really.
I just said what I noticed.

00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:22.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino] I'd like to thank
you properly sometime.

00:07:22.247 --> 00:07:23.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
Call me when you're not busy.

00:07:27.252 --> 00:07:28.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] What did
he say to you?!

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:30.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
Weird stuff like,
"Aren't you living all alone?"

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Are you able to laugh freely?"

00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:33.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
All sorts of things.
I don't know.

00:07:33.924 --> 00:07:35.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Wait a minute!

00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:36.827 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the legendary MC!

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:39.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, it must have been
Yusuke Yoshino himself.

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:41.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you know this guy?

00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:42.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do I know him?!

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's a retired
charismatic musician.

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:47.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
His CDs were huge
chart toppers, man.

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:48.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] He disappeared.

00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:52.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I never thought he might
be right in this neighborhood.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
My kid sister copied me
a tape of his best pieces.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:57.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen to this!

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Just a minute,
you have a younger sister?!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I do.
Didn't I tell you that?

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara's sister...

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:06.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
She probably looks like this!

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
Reowr!

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
[music playing]

00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:15.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yusuke Yoshino...

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:21.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Okazaki?
Are you listening?

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:23.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:24.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what is it?

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:26.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's about that Tomoyo Sakagami.

00:08:26.534 --> 00:08:28.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been thinking
about something...

00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll bet she's really
a guy in a dress.

00:08:30.904 --> 00:08:33.840 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh?
[Youhei] There's no way a girl
can be stronger than a guy!

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's dressed like a girl to fool
everybody, that's what it is!

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you being serious, dude?

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:40.378 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'm going to prove
it to you tomorrow.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
That she's really a guy
and not a girl.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] At that moment,
Sunohara didn't realize yet,

00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:48.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
that he was beginning
his life as a pervert.

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:51.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can hear what you're
saying, you know.

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
Haven't you learned your lesson?

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:56.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, Tomoyo.

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:58.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not here to challenge
you today.

00:08:58.493 --> 00:08:59.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to talk
to you a little.

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:01.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just listen to what
he has to say, will you?

00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:05.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
I overslept this morning.
What a mess I am! Teehee.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your character seems
to have changed a little.

00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:10.838 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I went to shave,
that blade was so dull,

00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:14.807 position:5% line:77% align:start
and I'm sure you know how it is,
but man doesn't that hurt
like crazy!

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:15.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:17.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yohei] I hate to ask you,

00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:18.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
but could you lend
me your razor?

00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:21.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
And why exactly should
I have to lend you my razor?

00:09:21.647 --> 00:09:23.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hurray! I got her! I got her!

00:09:23.748 --> 00:09:25.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
You heard her, didn't you?

00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:26.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Didn't you?
[Tomoya] Well, I did, but...

00:09:26.384 --> 00:09:27.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is he so excited about?

00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:30.154 position:5% line:83% align:start
You asked me why you had
to lend me yours, didn't you?

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:33.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well that means you've got
a razor of your very own,

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
and that means...

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:38.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, nitwit. When I asked why
I had to lend it to you,

00:09:38.193 --> 00:09:41.863 position:5% line:77% align:start
I meant why should I
be obliged to lend you
anything belonging to me?

00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] In the first place...
[Youhei] In the first place?

00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you know it's rude to ask
a girl something like that?!

00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:49.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:09:51.338 --> 00:09:52.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
You bully!

00:09:52.805 --> 00:09:53.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
So long.

00:10:22.197 --> 00:10:23.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm so glad...

00:10:23.864 --> 00:10:28.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
So glad that I got up
the courage to wave.

00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:32.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
I truly thought you wouldn't
forgive me after I...

00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:35.574 position:5% line:83% align:start
after I hurt you on the
basketball court that day.

00:10:35.674 --> 00:10:38.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who should
be apologizing to you.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.510 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry...

00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sniffle]

00:10:45.882 --> 00:10:48.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, I'm so relieved.

00:10:49.686 --> 00:10:52.621 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so silly, aren't I? Hehe.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:00.463 --> 00:11:02.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, you may be
just a little silly,

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I think it's kind of sweet.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really, you do?

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.938 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm just like you,
so I'm in the same place.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:15.540 position:5% line:77% align:start
A place far away from people
who know how to get ahead
in the world,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
or who are clever at
maneuvering about.

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:19.611 position:5% line:89% align:start
Things may be hard sometimes,

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
but instead of
crying alone, call me.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:24.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:25.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, uh, I...

00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:27.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, I have nothing to do.

00:11:27.517 --> 00:11:29.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
And besides, if I keep
hanging around you,

00:11:29.387 --> 00:11:30.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think I'll
ever be bored.

00:11:30.887 --> 00:11:34.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, if I feel like I'm
about to cry, I'll call you.

00:11:43.898 --> 00:11:45.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing to me?

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:46.900 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.168 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:50.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm looking for my knife.

00:11:50.237 --> 00:11:50.971 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your knife?

00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:52.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh...

00:11:52.638 --> 00:11:53.473 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean this?

00:11:53.572 --> 00:11:54.740 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it back to me!

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
How are your hands?

00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:56.574 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] They don't hurt anymore.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm fine!

00:11:58.377 --> 00:11:59.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Shake!
[Fuko] Okay!

00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:01.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
It hurts, doesn't it?

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:02.646 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, it doesn't- er!

00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:04.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
It seems like it'd be painful.

00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:05.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
High five me!

00:12:05.616 --> 00:12:06.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dribble, dribble, dribble...

00:12:06.784 --> 00:12:07.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] From there again?

00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:08.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shoot!

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
It went in!

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:11.721 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah!

00:12:11.821 --> 00:12:12.587 position:5% line:83% align:start
[crying]
It still hurts, doesn't it?

00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:13.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
It doesn't hurt!

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:15.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
It does look painful.

00:12:15.724 --> 00:12:17.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Then,
boxer and trainer...

00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:18.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're going to be the trainer.

00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:22.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, now stand like this.

00:12:22.297 --> 00:12:24.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now get ready, because I'm going
to throw punches at you

00:12:24.498 --> 00:12:26.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
as hard as I can.
You understand me?

00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:27.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:12:27.368 --> 00:12:28.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know about this...

00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:31.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'll say,
"One, two, one, two!"

00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:33.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You got that?
[Fuko] Yeah, I got it.

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:34.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here goes!

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Jab, jab, straight!

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:38.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
One, two, one, two...

00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:40.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] One, two, one, two...

00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:42.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
One, two, one, two, one...

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] How long are you
going to keep that up?

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:46.817 position:5% line:89% align:start
[school bell]

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the first bell, let's go.

00:12:48.617 --> 00:12:50.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, okay!

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.221 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Um...

00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:52.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can have this!

00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:53.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:12:54.457 --> 00:12:55.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey!

00:12:57.493 --> 00:12:59.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>It's a star, right?</i>

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:04.131 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara...

00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:06.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you alive, Sunohara?

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.600 position:5% line:89% align:start
School's over.

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:10.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Class is over?

00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:13.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, around a hundred
years ago, actually.

00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:14.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] A hundred years?!

00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:15.907 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, you're dead!

00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:18.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right, I'm not me.
I'm a hologram.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.378 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei] Are you serious?
[Tomoya] When you got
kicked by Tomoyo,

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:23.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
you were knocked out and have
been asleep for a hundred years.

00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:26.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the world one hundred
years later, my old friend.

00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:29.486 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just a minute! Then, what's
become of the world since
I've been asleep?

00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:30.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
Total chaos.

00:13:30.553 --> 00:13:31.620 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you serious?!

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear Dad! My dear Mom!

00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:35.557 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry I was such a fool.

00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:38.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
I swear I'll live my life
the best I can.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Come on, get up,
will you?

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:42.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait a minute!
A hologram kicked me?

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:44.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
T-Then you're the real
thing, aren't you?

00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:46.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I am a cyborg.

00:13:46.366 --> 00:13:49.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, what you said about the
world falling into ruins...

00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:50.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's true.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you serious?!

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.440 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry
I was such a fool.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
I will join forces with the
Okazaki cyborg and go on living.

00:13:58.676 --> 00:13:59.978 position:5% line:77% align:start
[crying]
You'd believe anything,
wouldn't you?

00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:01.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? You mean that was a lie?

00:14:02.045 --> 00:14:03.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
You actually believed it?

00:14:03.448 --> 00:14:06.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I was half asleep,
so of course I would!

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.451 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you listening?

00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:14.222 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you looking for something?

00:14:15.558 --> 00:14:18.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oink, oink...

00:14:18.493 --> 00:14:20.928 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yohei] H-He's too cute...
[Tomoya] Yeah...
[oinking]

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.796 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] There's something
about him that's missing
in a dog or cat.

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:25.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what is it?

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:26.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:32.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Hey, come on,
don't run away.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:34.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's not too happy.

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Hey!
[Youhei] Huh?

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:37.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gyah!

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara!

00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:47.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, how did that compare
with Tomoyo's kick?

00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:49.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Isn't there something
else you should be asking me?

00:14:51.554 --> 00:14:55.957 position:5% line:77% align:start
I saw it... something light blue
along with the bottom of one
of her shoes.

00:14:56.057 --> 00:14:57.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:14:58.426 --> 00:14:59.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pervert!

00:15:02.564 --> 00:15:03.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
Urg!

00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:08.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:10.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
How dare you? What were you
trying to do with my baby?

00:15:10.802 --> 00:15:12.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, what is that thing?
Your pet?

00:15:12.572 --> 00:15:14.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
And isn't it just adorable?

00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:16.975 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] It's an urinko.
A baby boar.
[oinking]

00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:18.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Did it come
to meet you?

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:19.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Probably...

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
Her name is Botan.
Isn't she so cute?

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:24.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's a very
tasty-sounding name!

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:26.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm? What was that?

00:15:26.282 --> 00:15:27.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Nothing.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Come on, Botan,
say hello.

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:31.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell him you want
to be friends.

00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:33.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
[oinking]

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:38.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Practice the
briefing session?

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:39.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, if you ask me,
you're not really the type

00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:42.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
to handle something like
this that easily, are you?

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.299 position:5% line:77% align:start
I thought that maybe I'd find
a "how to" book for giving
speeches in front of groups.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you think we'll find
something here?

00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:50.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Oh, welcome...

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is anything wrong today?

00:15:54.906 --> 00:15:57.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps maybe I can
serve either of you something?

00:15:57.508 --> 00:15:58.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, how about a cup of coffee?

00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:00.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! I love coffee!

00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:02.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll make some right away.

00:16:02.112 --> 00:16:04.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please have a seat over there.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Here you go.

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:11.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you very much.

00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:17.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] It's good!
[Yukine] Oh, I'm so glad.

00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:21.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
My name is Yukine Miyazawa.

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:25.633 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] So, you're Tomoya
Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa?

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I take it that this is your
first time here, isn't it?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes! How do you do?

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.838 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, are you the one who's
overseeing this room then?

00:16:32.938 --> 00:16:34.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I do my best to anyway.

00:16:34.972 --> 00:16:36.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just love this place.

00:16:36.508 --> 00:16:39.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I remember, this used to be
the library room, wasn't it?

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
It still is, Nagisa.

00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:43.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of the books that
don't get read much

00:16:43.113 --> 00:16:45.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
are kept here in this place
for safe keeping.

00:16:45.415 --> 00:16:48.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you could call
it the Second Library Room.

00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:51.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
We even have old videos,
records, casette tapes,
even microfilm.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad to hear that. I was
under the impression this room

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
had been turned into
some kind of café.

00:16:56.424 --> 00:17:00.260 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sometimes I get all sorts of
people who come and visit me
in this room.

00:17:01.663 --> 00:17:03.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Is something wrong?

00:17:03.463 --> 00:17:04.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I was just thinking

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
there are some really unique
characters in this school.

00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:09.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:12.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No, in this
town I'd say.

00:17:14.139 --> 00:17:16.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright now, just talk
to me like I've come

00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:18.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
to check things out
with the new club.

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:20.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
Keep calm, breathe,
and enunciate carefully.

00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:22.313 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, got it!
Let's see now...

00:17:22.413 --> 00:17:27.116 position:5% line:77% align:start
Welcome, everyone! I'm Nagisa
Furukawa and I'm in of
Class 3-B.

00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:29.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:30.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope you'll enjoy it here.

00:17:30.753 --> 00:17:32.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Keep it up!
What's next?

00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:33.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, let me tell you,

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:37.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
the reason I decided to
revive the Drama Club is...

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:37.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is...

00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:39.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:42.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Listen, I'm amazed
you want to do drama.

00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:45.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have any experience
in drama to begin with?

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:47.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I'm a complete amateur.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:50.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know anything
about the dramatic arts.

00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:55.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
Club Leader,
that statement was a bomb.

00:17:56.541 --> 00:17:57.709 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Question!

00:17:57.809 --> 00:17:59.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
What sort of plays are
you going to put on?

00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:02.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] What sort of plays?

00:18:02.145 --> 00:18:03.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, there are
all sorts, right?

00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:05.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are musicals,
children's plays,

00:18:05.481 --> 00:18:08.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
realistic, contemporary,
surreal, absurdism...

00:18:08.484 --> 00:18:09.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are there that many?

00:18:09.618 --> 00:18:12.954 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm leaving.
[Nagisa] Wait! Don't go!

00:18:13.054 --> 00:18:14.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Then,
answer my questions.

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said there was a play
you wanted to do.

00:18:16.524 --> 00:18:18.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
What sort of play is it?

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:21.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, it's... It's a very,
very amusing play.

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:23.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's much too vague
of an answer for me.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it a surreal comedy?

00:18:25.398 --> 00:18:28.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's actually a whole lot
more than just a comedy.

00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:31.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, it's a comedy that's
really touching?

00:18:31.103 --> 00:18:33.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, it might bring
you to tears,

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it's really quite funny too-

00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:36.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
Will it make you laugh or cry?
Which is it?

00:18:37.007 --> 00:18:40.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, it's about half and half.
[awkward laugh]

00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:41.911 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:43.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, that's okay,

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:46.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
at least you made an attempt
to answer my question.

00:18:46.415 --> 00:18:49.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Alright. Now please ask
me the next question.

00:18:49.318 --> 00:18:51.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you tell me what were those
pictures on the poster?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.088 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] It's the
Big Dango Family!
[Tomoya] A quick answer!

00:18:54.188 --> 00:18:57.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the Big Dango Family,
recognized by any Japanese

00:18:57.825 --> 00:19:00.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
and they're incredibly
popular nationwide.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
A family of one hundred seems
like such fun; I envy them.

00:19:03.896 --> 00:19:08.032 position:5% line:77% align:start
If the whole family went to an
amusement park, I think there
would be chaos.

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:09.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] But the
Big Dango Family-

00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:11.503 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop talking!

00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:14.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Will you stop being so
talkative all of a sudden!

00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:16.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's such a difference in
the intensity it's distracting.

00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:18.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't mean to be.

00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:21.578 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, it's not bad to be
intense, but I don't think
it's right.

00:19:21.678 --> 00:19:25.815 position:5% line:77% align:start
You just shouldn't be putting so
much energy into the Big Dango
Family explanation.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I agree with you.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:28.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
That would turn this
into a briefing

00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:30.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
on the Big Dango Family,
now wouldn't it?

00:19:31.052 --> 00:19:32.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
The future looks bleak to me...

00:19:32.687 --> 00:19:35.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I kind of think so too...

00:19:35.523 --> 00:19:39.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, why do you want
to do drama, anyway?

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I mean, you have
no experience, right?

00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:43.129 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because I like it.

00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:44.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you like about it?

00:19:44.898 --> 00:19:46.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think that it would be so fun

00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:48.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
for everyone to
participate in a play,

00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:52.403 position:5% line:77% align:start
be part of a group, and make
something really beautiful
and artistic.

00:19:52.503 --> 00:19:55.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ever since I was little, I've
missed all the school plays,

00:19:55.473 --> 00:19:59.776 position:5% line:77% align:start
because I was always home sick
and in bed when the plays were
presented.

00:19:59.876 --> 00:20:04.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was absent a lot so I
couldn't even participate
in practices.

00:20:04.313 --> 00:20:08.049 position:5% line:77% align:start
So, I've always wanted to do
a play with everyone in my
high school.

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:11.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was always set on
joining the Drama Club.

00:20:12.153 --> 00:20:13.721 position:5% line:89% align:start
I decided in my heart of hearts,

00:20:13.822 --> 00:20:16.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I would work really hard
at Drama for three years.

00:20:16.858 --> 00:20:20.960 position:5% line:77% align:start
But even in high school,
I haven't been able to come
to school much.

00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:24.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was absent for most
of my senior year.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I still want to give
it a try, Okazaki.

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:30.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know anything. I might
be poor at acting, I know,

00:20:30.502 --> 00:20:34.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I want to do everything
I can and work really hard.

00:20:34.271 --> 00:20:38.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
Working together with everyone
on one wonderful thing...

00:20:38.107 --> 00:20:41.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think that would be
an amazing experience.

00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:43.646 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think, I just like it.

00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:46.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't think that's dumb?
[giggle]

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I think that's fine.

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should tell them
all of this at the briefing.

00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:02.061 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know what? I think you were
able to say want you wanted to
when you speak from your heart.

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:03.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you think so?

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.898 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm the type of guy who says
exactly what he thinks.

00:21:05.997 --> 00:21:07.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're telling me.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sometimes your words stab me.

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:12.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry about that.
Believe in your own words.

00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:14.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Kay...

00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:17.441 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to keep hanging
in there, okay?

00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:19.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will!

00:21:22.178 --> 00:21:24.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I wonder if people
will come to my briefing?

00:21:24.647 --> 00:21:27.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We won't know
until the time comes,

00:21:27.382 --> 00:21:29.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
but we put up all those posters.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
If two or three people come...

00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:35.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We put up a
poster here, didn't we?

00:21:35.623 --> 00:21:38.057 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm positive.

00:21:38.157 --> 00:21:39.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean the poster that
was in the middle?

00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:43.195 position:5% line:77% align:start
I saw someone from the
Student Council take it
down the other day.

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:46.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
Took it down? But why
would they take it?

00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:48.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Probably because
it hadn't received approval.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
You and he didn't put the poster
up by any chance did you?

00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:55.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then that means, that all the
other posters we put up...

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
[PA] Nagisa Furukawa,
Class 3-B...

00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:00.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please come to the Student
Council room at once.

00:22:00.977 --> 00:22:04.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
I repeat...
Nagisa Furukawa, Class 3-B...

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.616 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Furukawa...
[PA] Please come to the Student
Council room at once.

00:23:42.527 --> 00:23:43.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
You serious?

00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:45.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] So, teach me
how to talk to her

00:23:45.464 --> 00:23:46.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
to get her to like me.

00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:48.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're better at
dating than I am.

00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:23:52.503 --> 00:23:54.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, you just leave it to me.

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:57.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
The uniform looks good on you!

00:23:57.107 --> 00:23:58.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take this!

00:23:58.207 --> 00:23:59.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
This time I'm really different,

00:23:59.743 --> 00:24:01.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
I promise you that!

00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:04.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, in the first place...

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya & Youhei] No, no, no...

00:24:09.317 --> 00:24:11.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll be a homerun!
