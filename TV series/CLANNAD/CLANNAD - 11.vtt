[Kotomi] Tomoya...

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:08.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:10.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya!

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:14.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Simply divine...
[Tomoya] Gah...

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
K-K-Kotomi, it's you.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well hello, Tomoya-kun.
How are you today?

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:23.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Not good!

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:27.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what is it?
W-What's the matter?

00:00:27.213 --> 00:00:30.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, I was minding my own
business having a nice snooze...

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:33.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's exactly why I played
a lullaby for you, Tomoya.

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:36.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
The shock almost destroyed me!

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:38.357 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, who is she?!

00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:46.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello, how do you do?

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:49.500 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Kotomi Ichinose of 3-A.

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:51.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love to read, books I mean.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
And her deadly weapon
is the violin.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.474 position:5% line:77% align:start
Takes aim and fires in 0.2
seconds, she's a very
quick draw.

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:58.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
There have been countless
victims to date.

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.544 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]
[students screaming]

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:04.748 position:5% line:77% align:start
How strange, I don't recall
taking anyone down with
my violin.

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:06.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not before this.

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy 2] M..My eardrums...

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] We have a victim
right here!

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey! Kotomi, what do you
think you're doing?!

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh no, Kotomi!

00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:17.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
So that was you playing
after all? Oh no!

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:18.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kyou, Ryou, Nagisa...

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:22.096 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hello to you all.
It's so good to see you.

00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:24.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, no not hello!

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
How about, bonjour?

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.802 position:5% line:89% align:start
No!

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:33.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
Boooon-jouuur?

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou growls in frustration]

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I can't communicate
with her!

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:40.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] No, please calm
down, Kyou.

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:42.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah! We don't want to see HER
getting riled up, you know.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know that, Mr. Obvious!

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] What are you doing here?

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.692 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just playing the
violin, Kyou.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:57.063 position:5% line:77% align:start
Wait a minute, isn't that the
same violin that's from the
music room?

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:58.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well yes it is, but they
let me borrow it.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
They said that since I liked
playing with it so much,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
I could use it for
a little while.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.401 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remind me to thank
them for that.

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:05.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Let me play one more...

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Everyone] No thank you!

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:08.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou & Kotomi hit the ground]

00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:46.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hello!

00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:47.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well what a pleasent
surprise for me.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
It looks like Tomoya!

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:53.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
So that wasn't funny?
Not a little bit?

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.971 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Well, not even if you
said it sadly with your eyes
avoiding me.

00:03:57.072 --> 00:04:01.976 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] You see? Your timing
is bad and your gag lines
make no impact whatsoever.

00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:03.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's disastrous for a performer.

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Oh...
[Kyou] So, if you understand,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] go practice
in the corner.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:13.920 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] What exactly were you
guys talking about over there?
[Kotomi] Why is that?

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.122 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Shh! I have to keep
her occupied
[Kotomi] Why is that?

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.291 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] before she starts playing
the violin again.
[Kotomi] Why is that?

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well hello there!

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:24.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
What a pleasent surprise,
it's you, Ryou!

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh my goodness gracious,
you're all here!

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
And look, Nagisa's here
to see me too!

00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:33.671 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] You see? Your timing's
bad, so you don't finish
quickly enough.

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:36.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] How about you just try
it one more time.

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:38.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] All right.

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:41.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
And look, Nagisa's here
to see me too!

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:44.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well as I live and breathe,
you're here too, Kotomi!

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:47.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
How was that? Was that
any better, Kyou?

00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:50.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes. And let's leave
it at that, shall we?

00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:57.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] So many unusual things.

00:04:57.927 --> 00:05:01.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the first time I've ever
even opened this box.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.833 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] So tell me, have you
gotten new members for
the Drama Club?

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:10.805 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Not yet, but I hope to
have more members by the
school festival.

00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:13.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what is this thing?
Do you know what it could be?

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like a magic
wand to me.

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a magic wand? Really.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you wave it around and chant
a spell, stars shower over you

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:26.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you can transform youself
into anything you can thing of.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:05:30.023 --> 00:05:33.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
Teibi magunumu inominandoumu...

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:36.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shiguna suterunamu...

00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:38.097 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nigurarumu e...

00:05:38.197 --> 00:05:40.866 position:5% line:89% align:start
Efwani forumisu...

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sadokue shijirumu!

00:05:45.537 --> 00:05:48.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] It doesn't look
like anything's happening.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.277 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Maybe I didn't
pronounce every word in
the spell like I should have.

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.714 position:5% line:77% align:start
But you're amazing, Kotomi!
The way you said that
complicated spell.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh I wish I could say my lines
smoothly like you.

00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:02.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
They've become such good
friends, haven't they?

00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:05.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you sitting here
with me? Go join them.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.658 position:5% line:77% align:start
You want me to wave a magic
wand and say some mumbo-
jumbo incantation?

00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:11.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you really picture
me doing that?

00:06:11.127 --> 00:06:12.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:16.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
Switch!

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hirariku hirariku gyo gyo gyo
gyo gyo!

00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:22.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love fish!

00:06:22.437 --> 00:06:23.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.075 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] How about I punch you
til you cry?
[Tomoya] I'm sorry.

00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:28.609 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing the
violin terribly]
[Kyou screams]

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you think
you're doing?!

00:06:30.644 --> 00:06:33.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
We mentioned that she was better
at playing the violin

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
than casting difficult
magical spells.

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:37.383 position:5% line:89% align:start
Play it somewhere else, will ya?

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:39.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
If the Drama Club gets
a bad reputation,

00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:40.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
it'll be bad for the leader.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, don't you worry
about me.

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:47.727 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I want, want lots and lots
of people to hear me play the
violin all day long.

00:06:47.827 --> 00:06:49.428 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] No you really don't.

00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
You used to prefer being
cooped up in the school library,

00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:56.001 position:5% line:77% align:start
I guess you're saying things
have changed for you now and
you like getting out more.

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to have to play a
whole lot, because very soon

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:02.573 position:5% line:77% align:start
I just know that I'll have
return this violin to the
music room.

00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:06.110 position:5% line:77% align:start
So I want to play as many
wonderful selections
while I can.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sis, I think you and I should
do something for her.

00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:11.015 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me see...

00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:13.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think I got it!

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] The day after tomorrow,
on Monday,

00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're making your debut
playing the violin.

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:20.323 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] My violin debut?
[Kyou] I'll gather lots
of people

00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:22.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
to make sure your debut
is packed.

00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:25.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
Until then, playing the
violin in here is taboo!

00:07:25.427 --> 00:07:27.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
My own violin debut?

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:33.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay! I promise I'll practice
really hard.

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:36.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Would you mind
if I joined you?

00:07:36.138 --> 00:07:37.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Me too!

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:39.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, then I'll co- Aah!

00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:42.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
He and I need to discuss the
details of the concert.

00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:45.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, we'll just go by
ourselves, you stay here.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:49.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sounds like a plan. See you both
later. Goodbye.

00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What could you
and I possibly have to discuss?

00:07:53.587 --> 00:07:56.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Discuss a strategy to break you
away from Kotomi.

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.026 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's always sticking to you
like Elmer's Glue.

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's better for her to associate
with other people.

00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:04.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you're probably right.
I guess.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. So anyway...

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:08.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like you and I are
all alone now.

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:09.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what do you want to do?

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:11.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm tired, I'm going
to take a nap.

00:08:11.603 --> 00:08:14.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
That is so rude!
You could be nicer.

00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:16.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't attack me while
I'm sleeping.

00:08:16.608 --> 00:08:24.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]

00:08:24.114 --> 00:08:26.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I wonder if they'll be
okay by themselves?

00:08:26.817 --> 00:08:29.853 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to realize that you
spoil her too much.

00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:32.689 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ryou and Nagisa are keeping her
company, don't worry.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's because those two are
together that I'm worried.

00:08:36.025 --> 00:08:39.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Say, you're not seeing
anyone are you?

00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:44.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
If there's a girl somewhere who
absolutely adores you,

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:49.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
would you think about dating
her? Maybe going out?

00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:50.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What's with you
all of a sudden?

00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:52.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Just answer!

00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:53.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Even if we do date,

00:08:53.308 --> 00:08:54.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm a good-for-nothing
delinquent.

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:57.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
She'll get over me in no time,
I promise you that.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] There's a certain appeal
about delinquents,

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:02.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
especially to honor students.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:05.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying that Sunohara
appeals to honor students too?

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:09.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Your little friend?
Not on your life.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] It was good
talking to you.

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:13.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you tomorrow, Tomoya.

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:43.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Nagisa probably isn't up yet.</i>

00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Even Sunohara wouldn't...</i>

00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:47.657 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]
No! That's impossible!

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:49.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:51.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kotomi!

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:54.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Oh, hello, Tomoya.
How are you?

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:58.067 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm fine, but it's
Sunday, Kotomi. Why are
you here?

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:01.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you a ghost or something
that haunts this school?

00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:03.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
Haunt? Are you saying
I'm bewitching?

00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:05.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't say another word.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
So are you a bully,
like all the others?

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:11.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's just that line was so
tacky I had to stop you.

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:12.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you understand?

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:15.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya first you accused
me of being a kind of ghost,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.652 position:5% line:77% align:start
so I then segued into a retort
that cued off your word
haunting.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:23.756 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then I simply took the joke to
the next intellectual level by
using the word bewitching.

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:25.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you understand me?

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I got it! It wasn't
that advanced a retort.

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:28.961 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it at least intermediate?

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:33.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
To put it very bluntly, your
reply was REALLY low level

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
in every aspect!

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:37.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really are a bully,
aren't you?

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] An honorary
library monitor?

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] I would borrow the key
every day,

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.141 position:5% line:89% align:start
so the librarian gave me a key,

00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:45.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
and made me an honorary
library monitor.

00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:48.413 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was so happy when
she did that.

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:51.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] So, that's why you're
in the library on a Sunday.

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:55.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] I usually read, but I'm
practicing the violin today.

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:58.755 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was told the drama room
is taboo, so I came here.

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:01.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought it was the next
best place.

00:11:01.724 --> 00:11:03.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is that?
Your bento lunch box?

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:06.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be honest with you,
I had a little inkling that you

00:11:07.063 --> 00:11:10.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
might come and join me for lunch
instead of going to the cafe.

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:12.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
So I have enough for two.

00:11:12.368 --> 00:11:14.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but what if I didn't come
here after all?

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:18.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't think about that. It
doesn't matter, you came.

00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:22.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's an apple pie.

00:11:22.344 --> 00:11:23.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
I made for the first time,

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:27.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I don't know if it tastes as
good as Mom use to make.

00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:29.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Now that's the
real McCoy.

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:30.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] I used Jonathan apples

00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:34.288 position:5% line:83% align:start
and brushed the top with a glaze
made with apricot jam and rum.

00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:38.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
And for the first time, I used
loose tea leaves to make tea.

00:11:38.692 --> 00:11:40.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope you like Oolong.

00:11:42.462 --> 00:11:43.662 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's have some.

00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:45.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah let's.

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:51.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh wow! Did you really make this
for the first time?

00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:53.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Umm, does it taste bad?

00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:55.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No, in fact, it's
amazingly good!

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:59.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you made it for
the first time!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd never get tired
of eating this!

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's the matter?

00:12:06.117 --> 00:12:07.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
I tap you and you stop shaking.

00:12:07.784 --> 00:12:10.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're just like an
electrical appliance.

00:12:10.654 --> 00:12:13.524 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Um, is it really good?

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:14.758 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really, truly?

00:12:14.858 --> 00:12:16.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yes! It was
really good.

00:12:16.493 --> 00:12:18.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so happy.

00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:19.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just so pleased.

00:12:19.596 --> 00:12:21.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was really nervous about it.

00:12:29.172 --> 00:12:30.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Tomoya...

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:31.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:35.777 --> 00:12:37.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
Day before yesterday,

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:39.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
I saw a rabbit.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, it was a deer.

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:45.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
And today, it's you.

00:12:46.353 --> 00:12:47.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kotomi?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're going to
continue practicing?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] I'm so full,
I'm going to rest.

00:12:58.364 --> 00:12:59.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Tomoya...

00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know how
to ask this but...

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:06.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you want to,
maybe you and I...

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:07.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:08.474 --> 00:13:09.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe we...

00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:12.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe the two of us could
read together.

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:16.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that all?

00:13:16.847 --> 00:13:18.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Listen, I gotta be
honest with you,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's not fun reading
books together.

00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:22.019 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Really?

00:13:22.119 --> 00:13:25.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah really. I know!
You can read to me.

00:13:26.257 --> 00:13:27.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Me?

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomota] I like to watch
you read,

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:32.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I really like the sound
of your voice.

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:35.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
But forget those difficult
science books.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.235 position:5% line:89% align:start
Read a novel or something.

00:13:38.335 --> 00:13:39.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Okay!

00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:44.940 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] In order for me to
get into a prestigious
comedy school,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been practicing
my violin.

00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:52.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No, somehow I really
don't think that plan will work.

00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:55.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] It's a discussion
of violins.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.020 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] If the Dango
flower blooms...
[Little Kotomis] Why? Why? Why?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.723 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Kotomi] I would be so
happy![echoing] If the Dango
flower blooms...
[Little Kotomis] Why? Why? Why?

00:14:01.822 --> 00:14:03.890 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] Dango family?!
[Kotomi] [echoing] I would
be so happy!
[Little Kotomis] Why? Why? Why?

00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:05.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm baking bread.
[Little Kotomis] Why? Why? Why?

00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:09.229 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Love will begin for
all of the Dango.
[Little Kotomis] Why? Why? Why?

00:14:12.965 --> 00:14:15.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Will you just look
at all the Dango!

00:14:15.636 --> 00:14:17.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] The cards tell me that...

00:14:18.237 --> 00:14:21.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, you have
a split personality.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.643 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] How can you tell
something like that through
fortune-telling?!

00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:25.176 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Well...

00:14:25.278 --> 00:14:29.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
That kind of reaction is typical
of schizophrenia.

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:30.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] No, little sister.

00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:32.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid he is my patient.

00:14:32.751 --> 00:14:36.120 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, somehow I just knew
that you would be showing
up soon.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] The aroma of baking bread

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:41.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
makes the mental state
of a person unhealthy.

00:14:41.258 --> 00:14:42.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] That makes no sense.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Oh yes it does.

00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:48.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
And it's all due to the aroma
from baking bread.

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:51.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Tomoya...

00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:52.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:14:53.236 --> 00:14:56.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey Tomoya, you've been
moaning a lot.

00:14:56.172 --> 00:14:58.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I was having the
weirdest dream just now.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Was it a scary dream?

00:15:00.242 --> 00:15:02.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] More like mixed up and
very distrubing.

00:15:05.013 --> 00:15:06.448 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Okay, Tomoya.

00:15:06.548 --> 00:15:07.948 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:09.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, see you tomorrow.

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:12.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Um, Tomoya?

00:15:13.354 --> 00:15:14.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah? What is it?

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad that you came
to spend time with me.

00:15:17.358 --> 00:15:20.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had a really nice
time with you.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't see how, I was sleeping
most of the time.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe so, but it still made
me happy.

00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:28.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you.

00:15:29.968 --> 00:15:33.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Kotomi Ichinose
Violin Recital...

00:15:33.238 --> 00:15:34.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
The one who wrote this...

00:15:34.907 --> 00:15:36.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
that would be you, right?

00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:39.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, Kyou asked me to draw
one for the concert.

00:15:39.778 --> 00:15:43.215 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was wondering about the
relevance of the Big
Dango Family,

00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:46.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I kept it in for
visual impact.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] I'm sure we'll have
a full house.

00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:52.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Do you really think
that this is all right?

00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:56.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
I got scolded when I put up the
Drama Club membership poster.

00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:59.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it those
school council rule enforcers.

00:15:59.162 --> 00:16:00.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll tell them some story.

00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:03.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Get some tips from her
chutzpah, Nagisa.

00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:05.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you keep worrying about
everything around you,

00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:08.605 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'll never revive the Drama
Club. Turst me on this one.

00:16:08.705 --> 00:16:10.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] You're probably right.

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:14.443 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] All right! Invite every
single person until school
lets out!

00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:18.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Thanks for coming.

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:21.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, you know, you did invite
me after all.

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:25.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I've never been to a violin
concert. I'm so excited.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe I shouldn't say this since
I invited you,

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:31.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if I were you I would try to
stay in the back of the group

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
and be ready to run
out anytime.

00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:40.166 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Boy 1] What'd you do?
[Boy 2] I skipped cleaning duty
the day before yesterday.

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:43.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 3] All I did was forget my
Daily Guide print-out at home!

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
And this is my punishment?!

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.840 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Boy 4] She caught me taking
an early lunch
 <i>[Tomoya] Leave it to Kyou.</i>

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.041 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Boy 4] six months ago
 <i>[Tomoya] She's using her power</i>
 <i>as Class Representive</i>

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:51.878 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Boy 4] and threatens me now!
 <i>[Tomoya] to blackmail kids</i>
 <i>into attending.</i>

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:53.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look at this crowd!

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:55.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is something happening?

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:57.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you came here not
knowing a thing?

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:00.918 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kyou called me out. She said
this really pretty girl wants
to meet me.

00:17:01.018 --> 00:17:04.890 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know, it's a hard life for
popular guys like me.
It's a burden.

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:07.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see then, I wish you all
the luck in the world.

00:17:07.324 --> 00:17:10.728 position:5% line:77% align:start
If we become close personal
friends, I'll introduce you
to her.

00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:12.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you around!

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:13.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
No sense in ruining it.

00:17:13.564 --> 00:17:16.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll let him enjoy his
dream a little longer.

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:18.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Misae, you came too?

00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:20.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
The rugby team was kind
enough to invited me.

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:23.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I don't know. I had some
free time, I was curious too.

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Excuse me a moment...

00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:30.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't mean to bother you, but
wouldn't you be Misae Sagara

00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:32.981 position:5% line:89% align:start
who manages the boys' dorm?

00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:34.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
You see, my name is
Tomoyo Sakagami.

00:17:35.082 --> 00:17:37.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've always heard so many
things about you.

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:40.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
You are the legendary student
council president,

00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:42.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're practically famous
all over Tokyo.

00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:45.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
Legenday student president?
Practically famous?

00:17:45.393 --> 00:17:47.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] That's so exaggerated.
[Tomoya] You?

00:17:47.194 --> 00:17:50.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was really nothing that
grand. Right?

00:17:50.397 --> 00:17:52.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm aspiring to be a student
council president.

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:55.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would just love it if I could
come by to talk to you sometime?

00:17:55.869 --> 00:18:00.807 position:5% line:77% align:start
I really don't have that much to
tell you, but you're welcome to
come visit with me anytime.

00:18:00.907 --> 00:18:03.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rugby player ] Hey Misae!

00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:05.978 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Misae] If you'll excuse me.

00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:08.681 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hard to think Misae was a
student council president.

00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:10.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm grateful, Okazaki!

00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:12.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for inviting
me to this concert.

00:18:12.918 --> 00:18:13.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:18:13.752 --> 00:18:15.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Okazaki!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.255 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Sanae! And you too?

00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:18.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't believe you showed up.

00:18:18.823 --> 00:18:21.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Uh, I invited
them, Okazaki.

00:18:21.292 --> 00:18:23.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had to come here since
my daughter invited me.

00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:28.098 position:5% line:77% align:start
We're so sorry. Akio and I
weren't able to come to the
Founder's Festival,

00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:30.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we- so we decided
to come to this.

00:18:30.701 --> 00:18:31.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
You sure about this?

00:18:31.768 --> 00:18:33.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi's performance is kinda...

00:18:33.437 --> 00:18:37.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh don't you worry! She's become
quite proficient at playing it.

00:18:37.673 --> 00:18:39.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, look everyone,
here's Kotomi!

00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:41.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] She's so cute.

00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:44.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Not as cute as my
daughter though.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hello everyone! Thank you
all so much for coming!

00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:51.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy 4] Would you look at this?
Just look what she made me buy.

00:18:51.786 --> 00:18:54.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy 5] Me too, it cost 300 yen.

00:18:54.256 --> 00:18:56.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now this makes sense.
Kyou was making money!

00:18:56.525 --> 00:18:59.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now listen! The earplugs are
a last resort.

00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:03.197 position:5% line:77% align:start
If I see any of you using them
needlessly, you're going to
be punished!

00:19:03.297 --> 00:19:06.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey Kotomi, please thank
everyone for coming.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Okay.

00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:12.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Kotomi Ichinose
and I'm in 3-A.

00:19:12.873 --> 00:19:14.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really love reading.

00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:16.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nice to see you all.

00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:19.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well done! Applaud, everyone!

00:19:19.512 --> 00:19:22.481 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, you deadbeats, if you
know what's good for you
start clapping!

00:19:22.581 --> 00:19:23.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
[audience applauds]

00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:24.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well I have to say,

00:19:24.449 --> 00:19:25.985 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's a nice introduction.

00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:30.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do recall that you and I have
met them somewhere before this.

00:19:30.756 --> 00:19:32.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] That's Kyou and Ryou.

00:19:32.356 --> 00:19:34.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've all become really
good friends recently.

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:37.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Bring them over someday.
We'll show them our hospitality!

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:39.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] All right!

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here's the first number.

00:19:46.336 --> 00:19:48.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
[rythmic clacking]
[triangle dings]

00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:50.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]
[students screaming]

00:19:50.173 --> 00:19:52.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
You call this proficient?!
Are you crazy?!

00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:54.844 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]
[students screaming]

00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:01.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] HELP!

00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:03.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't get carried away!
Cut it out!

00:20:03.485 --> 00:20:10.059 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing
the violin terribly]
[students screaming]

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:12.026 position:5% line:83% align:start
Botan, what are you doing
here again?!

00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:15.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] You call this
a performance?!

00:20:15.195 --> 00:20:19.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Student] [crying] Please
make it stop!

00:20:19.399 --> 00:20:27.541 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi playing the
violin terribly]
[students screaming]

00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:33.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh my dear Akio, I can't hang
on any longer.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Sanae! Wake up! Sanae!

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:40.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
SANAE!

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:47.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] It ended nicely somehow.

00:20:47.492 --> 00:20:49.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] The audience was gasping
for breath though.

00:20:49.995 --> 00:20:54.765 position:5% line:77% align:start
Still, I have to say, that I
think your final piece was
very well done.

00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:56.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even my father complimented you.

00:20:56.734 --> 00:21:01.137 position:5% line:77% align:start
And said it's been a while since
he's seen a performance with so
much impact.

00:21:01.237 --> 00:21:03.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad.
I'm so happy.

00:21:03.874 --> 00:21:08.811 position:5% line:77% align:start
Tell me again, why do we all
have to go to such enormous
lengths just for her?

00:21:08.911 --> 00:21:12.682 position:5% line:77% align:start
There's a childlike quality
about her that you just
can't seem to ignore.

00:21:12.782 --> 00:21:16.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
She somehow stirs your maternal
instincts and makes you just

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:18.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
want to take care of her
all day long.

00:21:18.253 --> 00:21:19.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's so true, Sister.

00:21:20.088 --> 00:21:22.289 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it's for Kotomi,
I would do anything

00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:25.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
to support her in her
professional dreams.

00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:26.627 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're such a nice person.

00:21:26.728 --> 00:21:29.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
Isn't she supposed to be your
rival in love?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey what rival in love?
What are you talking about?

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:33.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Nothing! Nothing at all!

00:21:35.036 --> 00:21:37.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, what's that?

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:37.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Nagisa!

00:21:38.072 --> 00:21:39.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki!

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:42.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi!

00:21:42.976 --> 00:21:44.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Gentleman] I need to talk to-
[Tomoya] What's going on?!

00:21:44.611 --> 00:21:46.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look here, buddy, if you need
to talk to somebody,

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:48.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
you can talk to me.

00:21:48.647 --> 00:21:50.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no I...

00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:54.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess, I'll have to leave
it for another day.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:55.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Gentleman] I will see
you again.

00:21:58.857 --> 00:22:00.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
So who was that guy?

00:22:00.893 --> 00:22:03.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's a very bad man...

00:22:03.795 --> 00:22:04.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What?

00:22:04.862 --> 00:22:06.664 position:5% line:89% align:start
A very bad man...

00:23:43.552 --> 00:23:45.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Thank you
so much, Tomoya.

00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:49.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't met you, I would
never have felt this joy.

00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:53.028 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] You're giving me
too much credit. I didn't
do anything.

00:23:53.128 --> 00:23:58.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, Kyou and Fujibayashi,
they all like you. That's all.

00:23:58.332 --> 00:24:01.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] If that's true, then
I'm really happy.

00:24:03.637 --> 00:24:05.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kotomi, what's wrong?

00:24:07.841 --> 00:24:08.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Kotomi?
