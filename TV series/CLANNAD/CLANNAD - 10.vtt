 <i>[Voice] What is this light?</i>

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:17.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I would not know</i>
 <i>a sight like this.</i>

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:32.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
So tell me, is
that light strange?

00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
And the sky?

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
And the ground?

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:45.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Only this light is strange?

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder why that's
the way it is?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] For this girl who</i>
 <i>stays here all the time,</i>

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:59.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>this light is part of nature.</i>

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:04.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>"This is a shadow," I thought,</i>

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:07.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>"but a shadow is cast."</i>

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:11.041 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>"So, what cast this shadow?"</i>

00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:14.211 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute. To think
that something is strange

00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:18.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
means you have knowledge
of that which is not strange.

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:22.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Voice] I will delve</i>
 <i>deep into my memories.</i>

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:27.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Sometime long ago, or</i>
 <i>perhaps way into the future,</i>

00:01:27.723 --> 00:01:30.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I was in another world.</i>

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>That is one sensation</i>
 <i>I remember.</i>

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, hi there. How are
you today, Okazaki?

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:23.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, what are you
doing here now?

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're gonna be late.

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:26.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
I caught a glimpse of you
and thought that maybe

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:29.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
we could walk together,
so I waited for you.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.533 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] You don't want to?
[Tomoya] Why would I not wanna
walk with you to school?

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.768 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon, let's go.

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Kay!

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.539 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] No one's been
signing up for the club.
[Nagisa] No...

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.376 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Maybe I should
just go talk to her.
[Nagisa] Who?

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:46.644 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Motorbike progressively
getting closer]
[Tomoya] Huh?

00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:48.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Out of the way, Tomoya!

00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:52.249 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya!
[Nagisa] Okazaki,
are you all right?!

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
Speak to me! Please get up!

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya!

00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:57.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Okazaki...

00:03:58.087 --> 00:03:59.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
He seems all right. Oh well.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:00.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're leaving me behind?!

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just joking.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.162 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I think I'm all right.

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:09.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Oooh.
[Tomoya] What?

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:11.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seems you two've
become awfully close,

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:13.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
calling her by her
first name, I see.

00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:16.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are the two of you dating?
Maybe you've even kissed?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No, we're friends!
[Nagisa] O-Okazaki is just

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
helping me with
reviving the club!

00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:22.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
How can you even suggest it?!

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why it's just ludicrous!

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:27.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fine, we'll just leave the
two of you as friends then.

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:29.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm going on ahead.

00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:36.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, are you sure
you're not really hurt?

00:04:36.788 --> 00:04:38.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me ask you something.

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you remember when I
started calling you Nagisa?

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:43.961 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, uh...

00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya gasps]
[Nagisa gasps]

00:04:47.864 --> 00:04:51.400 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was just about to
remember something that
happened in our past.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was too.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something so very
warm and nostalgic.

00:04:56.872 --> 00:04:59.008 position:5% line:89% align:start
And somehow sad...

00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:00.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's hard to explain.

00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:05.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shall we go, Nagisa?

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:07.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes. Let's go to school.

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:13.553 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] Recruit members?

00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:16.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, even if you come along,
it won't be much fun.

00:05:16.757 --> 00:05:17.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon, don't say that.

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to do everything
I can to help Nagisa too.

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:22.460 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wha-what are you saying?

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
That you really like Nagisa?

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.833 position:5% line:77% align:start
Of course! I've never loved
anyone this seriously
before Nagisa.

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:31.736 position:5% line:77% align:start
In the library up ahead,
there's a young girl
and she's always alone,

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:34.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
just sitting there reading
really advanced textbooks.

00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:37.541 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you strike up a
conversation, she may
even treat you to a meal.

00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's super cute,
pure, and smart.

00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:42.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if I'm not mistaken,
she's not seeing anyone.

00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:43.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please introduce me!

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:45.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's probably there now.

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:46.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make your move.

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:47.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:51.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sounds of Youhei throwing
a fit, and books, around]

00:05:51.653 --> 00:05:53.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is that guy doing in there?

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.064 position:5% line:89% align:start
She totally ignored me!

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow, that
didn't take long.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
I approached her and
tried to hit on her,

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I didn't get a single
reaction out of her.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:12.237 position:5% line:77% align:start
It ticked me off, so I tossed
around some books and knocked
down a couple of shelves,

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:16.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
but she still ignored me.
So who is this girl anyway?

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:19.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi Ichinose,
you must know her.

00:06:19.243 --> 00:06:23.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kotomi Ichinose? Oh, you
mean the famous genius?

00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, that explains it.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, she lives in a totally
different world from us.

00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:31.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sheesh. What a bunch of
wasted time that was.

00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:34.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lives in a different
world, does she?

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya sighs heavily]

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kotomi.

00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:47.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kotomi-chan.

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:48.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya, nice to see you.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.446 position:5% line:77% align:start
Tomoya, you know we shouldn't
leave books lying around the
library like this.

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:03.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the same thing
over and over, isn't it?

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:06.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Drama Club?

00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:08.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I told
you about it before.

00:07:08.353 --> 00:07:10.322 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're recruiting members.

00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:12.423 position:5% line:83% align:start
Won't you meet with the
club leader after class?

00:07:12.523 --> 00:07:14.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
She won't bully me, will she?

00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:15.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guarantee she won't,

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:17.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you have nothing
to worry about.

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:20.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Hi there.
[Tomoya] I might have found us

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
a potential drama club member.

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go on, Kotomi.
Say hello, will ya?

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:25.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you say so. Hi, Tomoya.

00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:27.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not to me, you goof!

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.740 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right. Go on, don't be
afraid. Tell her your name.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.475 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:37.745 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hi there. It's Kotomi,
written in hiragana.
Written as ko-to-mi.

00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:41.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nice to meet you.
My name is Nagisa.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name can be written in
in one Chinese directive.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Nagisa...?
[Nagisa] Yes?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you have anything else to
talk about besides your names?

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:52.259 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] My last
name is Ichinose.
[Nagisa] Furukawa.

00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:54.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Class A.
[Nagisa] I'm Class B.

00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:56.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Type A blood.
[Nagisa] Oh my gosh, I am too!

00:07:56.829 --> 00:07:58.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Pork cutlet sandwich.
[Nagisa] Anpan!

00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:00.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] African elephants!
[Nagisa] Cats!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.569 position:5% line:77% align:start
Stop right there!
This exchange is totally
meaningless and pointless.

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
She may not look it,
but she is so smart

00:08:06.604 --> 00:08:10.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
the faculty doesn't even make
her take college prep courses.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
All she does all
day is read books,

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:13.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
so she has a huge vocabulary.
In other words,

00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:16.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think that she would be a
perfect fit for the Drama Cl-

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is she doing over there?

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi coughs]

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:21.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:23.385 position:5% line:89% align:start
A treasure box?

00:08:23.485 --> 00:08:27.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, it's not. Nagisa, say
something to her, will ya?

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:31.559 position:5% line:77% align:start
Umm, okay.
Your hair is so shiny.
I'm kind of jealous of you.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.062 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, not that! Go ahead
and invite her to join
the Drama Club!

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:37.765 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh.
[Tomoya] You and I practiced
your big speech, remember?

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:39.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
Recite some play,
like the line

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:41.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Let's shed tears
of youth together."

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
I won't have to shed
any tears, will I?

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:46.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think, if the
role calls for it,

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:47.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
you may have to
shed a few tears.

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:50.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
And maybe cry a little bit.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I really don't want to cry.

00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:56.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even so, if you have to cry,
then you're gonna cry.

00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
So tell me, are you a bully?

00:08:58.217 --> 00:09:01.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, not me.
I'm not a bully at all.

00:09:02.954 --> 00:09:04.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:09.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] It's the
Big Dango Family.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't tell me,
you like them?

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:19.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm. Very much.

00:09:20.702 --> 00:09:22.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm going
to walk Kotomi home.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:09:29.476 --> 00:09:32.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say, I was
a little scared today.

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:34.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have a tendency to be like
that when I talk to someone

00:09:35.048 --> 00:09:39.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I've just met for the first
time, but Nagisa was very kind.

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:45.024 position:5% line:77% align:start
You've always seemed so shy,
yet how come you got to
talking to me so easily?

00:09:45.124 --> 00:09:47.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa is a really nice person,

00:09:47.492 --> 00:09:50.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
and she can draw
really, really well.

00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:51.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think we should just
leave it at that.

00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:56.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, is Nagisa your
sweetheart, Tomoya?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
HMM?! No way!

00:09:58.468 --> 00:10:02.071 position:5% line:77% align:start
Good grief! You
are just like Kyou,
asking such a stupid question.

00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:03.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Kyou who?
[Tomoya] She's the class leader

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:05.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
for Class E and
tends to be brutal.

00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:10.479 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, hey Tomoya, there's
a place I want to stop
by on our way home.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everything is at your
convenience, is it?

00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:14.448 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You still
love books, don't you?

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:22.056 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] I must study
lots of things or I won't
become a great person.

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:24.025 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmph. Ah-huh, whatever.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:10:42.273 --> 00:10:44.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya gasp] Hey!

00:10:44.142 --> 00:10:45.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait! You can't do that!

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:51.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! What's the matter
with you, Tomoya?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't "what's the matter" me!

00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:56.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
However much you love books,
you can't cut out pages

00:10:56.353 --> 00:10:58.854 position:5% line:83% align:start
from books at school
or the bookstore.

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:02.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
If anything, copy the text
while no one's looking or...

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you'll get
scolded even for that.

00:11:04.826 --> 00:11:06.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:07.862 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really.

00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:09.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you should
start socializing more,

00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:12.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
and get out of that
library and meet people.

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:19.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi gasp]
Will she bully me? Will she?

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:21.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, she won't,
so just say hello.

00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:23.843 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you say so. Hi, Tomoya.

00:11:23.943 --> 00:11:26.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nice practice run,
next is the real McCoy.

00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:30.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
And just what am I
expected to do exactly?

00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:32.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Huh?!
[Tomoya] C'mon, Kotomi.

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.287 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. Hi there.

00:11:35.387 --> 00:11:39.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's Kotomi, written in
hiragana. Written as ko-to-mi.

00:11:39.857 --> 00:11:41.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Ugh.
[Kotomi] Is she a bully?

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, so this is the
famous girl genius?

00:11:44.362 --> 00:11:47.563 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wonder what she's doing
with a fat, lazy, loser,
degenerate like you?

00:11:47.663 --> 00:11:49.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who are you calling
fat, lazy, loser?!

00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:51.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
But she... she'll bully me!

00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:53.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, now. Don't be afraid of me.

00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:55.503 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is just how she is.

00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:57.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have lots of friends in
school, don't you, Kyou?

00:11:57.905 --> 00:12:00.675 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was just thinking
that maybe you could be
Kotomi's friend as well.

00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:03.344 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi whines softly]
[Kyou] You don't
become somebody's

00:12:03.444 --> 00:12:05.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
friend just to do them so favor.

00:12:05.213 --> 00:12:07.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't give friendships
away like that.

00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:08.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have to build them.

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:11.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
At times like this, you say all
the right things, don't you?

00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:15.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, what are you looking
after little miss intellect for?

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
What happened about
helping Nagisa?

00:12:17.723 --> 00:12:19.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's an on-going process.

00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:22.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
As you know, I have a reputation
for being helpful to others.

00:12:23.094 --> 00:12:27.098 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou sighs deeply]
Seems that another rival
has appeared on the scene.

00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:28.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will you say something?

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:29.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:31.902 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you, I have things to do.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.139 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, by the way...

00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:38.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Kyou Fujibayashi. Bye.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:44.746 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I will say this,
that was a pretty big
hurdle to overcome.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:46.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
You shouldn't feel too bad.

00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:48.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
But all you do is sit
here and read books.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should try talking to
people with jokes and retorts.

00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:53.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
You understand what I'm saying?

00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:54.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jokes and retorts?

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:56.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Let's practice
a little at a time.

00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:58.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
And the goal is
one hundred friends!

00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:02.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
One hundred friends?
Tomoya, you're amazing!

00:13:02.128 --> 00:13:04.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry! Even I don't
have that many friends.

00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:06.933 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Oh...
[Tomoya] No, don't
look so disappointed.

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:09.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just need to think
of a clever retort.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
A retort, huh?

00:13:12.237 --> 00:13:14.073 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:18.477 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry, I can't be
doing this with you.
So farewell, sir.

00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:20.978 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] The future
looks bleak, doesn't it?
[Kotomi] Hmm?

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:23.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's looking for...
for friends?

00:13:23.713 --> 00:13:26.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, she's soliciting
for a few close friends.

00:13:26.716 --> 00:13:27.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
Say hello.

00:13:27.751 --> 00:13:29.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you say so. Hello, Tomoya.

00:13:29.553 --> 00:13:31.954 position:5% line:83% align:start
That line's been
overused way too much.

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:35.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell me, how do you and Kotomi
know each other, Okazaki?

00:13:36.058 --> 00:13:38.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can consider us pals
at cutting class together.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though, I'm a slacker
and she's a genius.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.204 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, listen if you don't mind,
can I possibly tell your
fortune with my cards?

00:13:50.304 --> 00:13:54.308 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, now that's a
great way to start a
conversation with someone.

00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:55.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Here you are.

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:56.510 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is she a bully?

00:13:56.609 --> 00:13:58.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
To be honest, I have no idea.

00:13:58.579 --> 00:14:00.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
This'll be your
fortune for the day.

00:14:00.645 --> 00:14:03.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would like for you to
please pick three cards.

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:15.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now show them to me.

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:24.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think Ichinose
will make friends.

00:14:24.534 --> 00:14:29.606 position:5% line:77% align:start
GAH! Why are you contradicting
my efforts like that,
you saboteur?!

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:31.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi whimpers]
[Tomoya] Wait, wait, wait!

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
Running away won't change
a thing! Confront reality!

00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:38.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, tell me, are you a bully?

00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:40.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, not really.
I mean, I don't think so.

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:43.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you did! You just told
her she can't make friends!

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:45.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You are a bully!
[Ryou] But you know that

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:48.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
sometimes fortune-telling
can be inaccurate.

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if you get a negative
reading,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
depending on how much you and
the people around you try,

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's possible to
change the future.

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, is that how it works?

00:14:57.163 --> 00:14:59.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Yes! Well, what
I mean to tell you is

00:14:59.797 --> 00:15:02.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I think you're a really
fun person, Ichinose.

00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:05.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then are you saying that
you're going to be her friend?

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:09.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure! If I'll do, that is.

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:13.243 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Thank goodness she's
different from her rough
sister in that way.

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:16.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to say,
Ryou wasn't too scary.

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:19.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyone else but she would've
been taken aback by you.

00:15:19.849 --> 00:15:21.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
First is the most
basic of basics.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to learn how
to introduce yourself.

00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:28.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Hello, how do you do?
I'm Kotomi Ichinose from 3-A.

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:34.562 position:5% line:77% align:start
I love to read. It would
make me so very happy if
you and I could be friends.

00:15:34.662 --> 00:15:37.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was great! We'll practice
this during the next break.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there anyone around here?

00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:45.271 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi gasp]
[Tomoya] Whadda ya think
you're doing, Tomoyo?

00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:48.307 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] A bear...
[Tomoya] You're not on
campus police patrol.

00:15:48.407 --> 00:15:51.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, are you checking out
some kind of bear costume?

00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:55.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go ahead, greet the bear.

00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:57.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why, hello there... bear.

00:15:57.715 --> 00:15:59.183 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's so nice to meet you.

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:02.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi there. I'm Kotomi
Ichinose from 3-A.

00:16:02.386 --> 00:16:03.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
I simply love reading.

00:16:04.054 --> 00:16:07.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I would be extremely happy
if you and I could be friends.

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:08.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that possible?

00:16:24.706 --> 00:16:26.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think she actually likes you.

00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:28.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] It's so soft.
[Tomoya] So I take it that

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:31.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
you like stuffed bears
and things like that?

00:16:31.612 --> 00:16:34.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm. I love them.

00:16:36.482 --> 00:16:39.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Okazaki! I've been
looking all over for you!

00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:41.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's you and I go eat lunc-

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're that stupid bear that
kicked me the other day!

00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:47.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't move! I'm gonna
come get my reh-venge!

00:16:47.492 --> 00:16:51.228 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi] Reh-venge?
[Tomoya] You could say English
isn't his best subject.

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:55.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei gives a battle cry]

00:16:55.266 --> 00:16:57.934 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Youhei yells]
[Tomoya] As always,
an amazing kick.

00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:03.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
O-oh goodness. Oh?

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:06.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh dear, cutting class
with a girl today?

00:17:06.509 --> 00:17:09.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've cut class, but this
girl's really and truly smart,

00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:11.580 position:5% line:89% align:start
so she gets excused from class.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, hello there.
Nice to meet you.

00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:16.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Kotomi
Ichinose from 3-A.

00:17:16.784 --> 00:17:18.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Grace gasp]
[Kotomi] I simply love reading.

00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:21.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I would be extremely happy
if you and I could be friends.

00:17:21.988 --> 00:17:23.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that possible?

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well then. So you must be the
Ichinoses' daughter, Kotomi.

00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:30.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You know her?
[Grace] You live in town

00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:33.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you get to know
a great many people.

00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:37.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
And besides, her parents
are fine scholars.

00:17:37.302 --> 00:17:39.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Scholars?
[Kotomi] Mmm....

00:17:39.738 --> 00:17:42.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Are your parents
college professors or something?

00:17:43.741 --> 00:17:46.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well... yes.

00:17:46.243 --> 00:17:50.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see, so the difference between
us starts with our parents.

00:17:50.714 --> 00:17:52.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mmm...

00:17:53.082 --> 00:17:54.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Oh, found you!

00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:57.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
See? I won't bully you.
Nice girl!

00:17:57.253 --> 00:18:00.255 position:5% line:77% align:start
I thought you told me you
don't become friends as
a favor to someone?

00:18:00.356 --> 00:18:03.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, I did. That's why I
approached from my side.

00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:06.728 position:5% line:77% align:start
But you and I still
don't know very much
about each other, now do we?

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter. I'm sure that
if we go out together,

00:18:08.996 --> 00:18:11.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we'll get to
understand each other.

00:18:11.565 --> 00:18:14.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you think it's a chance
to show how dependable you are?

00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:16.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you trying
to get me into?

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:18.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna go call Ryou,
so you make sure to

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:20.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
take us somewhere fun later!

00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:24.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you think this
is a fun place?

00:18:24.943 --> 00:18:26.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it nice here?

00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:28.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey! I was expecting
to go to karaoke,

00:18:28.714 --> 00:18:30.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
or the game center,
or a restaurant!

00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:35.453 position:5% line:77% align:start
But I do hope that it's not a
terrible imposition that we
all came to this place.

00:18:35.553 --> 00:18:37.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I'm very happy.

00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:39.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] It hardly ever
gets lively in here.

00:18:39.557 --> 00:18:41.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think it's very lively.

00:18:41.224 --> 00:18:44.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, I created this opportunity
for you, little sister.

00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:46.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
Take advantage of it.
You need to step it up here.

00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:48.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:50.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Here goes...

00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:53.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, hello there.
It's so nice to meet you.

00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:56.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm Kotomi Ichinose
from class 3-A.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love simply reading.

00:18:57.872 --> 00:19:00.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I would be extremely happy
if you and I could be friends.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that possible?

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:05.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hello. I'm Nagisa
Furukawa from 3-B.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just love to perform.
If you and I could be friends,

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
that would be such a
wonderful thing for me.

00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:14.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
My name is Ryou
Fujibayashi from 3-D.

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:17.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
My favorite hobby is...
is reading peoples fortunes.

00:19:18.022 --> 00:19:20.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would be very happy
if we could be friends.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Kyou Fujibayashi from 3-E.

00:19:22.994 --> 00:19:24.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
Her hobby is
tormenting the weak.

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:28.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd would be so very happy if we
could all be very close friends.

00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:30.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya yells]
[Kyou] My hobby is what?!

00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:32.102 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, you okay?

00:19:32.202 --> 00:19:33.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Did you see that,
Kotomi?

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's called a retort.

00:19:35.506 --> 00:19:37.573 position:5% line:89% align:start
Learn that timing.

00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:41.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoyo... I have to say
that I'm very strong,

00:19:41.109 --> 00:19:43.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
so please, you shouldn't
be mean to me.

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:46.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I... can't
keep this up with you.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:49.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou and Nagisa
"oh", impressed]

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
This isn't what I
expected from today.

00:19:53.287 --> 00:19:55.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You should
all join the Drama Club.

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:56.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'll have more than
enough members to get

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
it sanctioned by
the school council.

00:19:59.225 --> 00:20:01.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for the club leader,
but I'll pass.

00:20:01.694 --> 00:20:04.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
Neither my sister nor I
are interested in drama.

00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:08.467 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh! But I would just
love it if you would stop
by now and then.

00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:12.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just know we can all learn
a lot about timing from you.

00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:15.440 position:5% line:83% align:start
I promise that I'm going to
practice lots and lots.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.210 position:5% line:77% align:start
And then, one day,
I will be really good
at making witty retorts.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's wonderful, Kotomi.

00:20:21.077 --> 00:20:24.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be there to support you,
so please do your best.

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:28.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, please! I would so much
like to support you too.

00:20:28.318 --> 00:20:31.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's all do our best,
the three of us!

00:20:31.387 --> 00:20:34.757 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] Okay!
[Kyou] What a strange
little group this is.

00:20:34.857 --> 00:20:37.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you're a vital,
integral part of it.

00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:38.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryuo, Nagisa, &
Kotomi giggling]

00:20:38.293 --> 00:20:40.161 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Oh well, whatever.

00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:41.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
She seems to be enjoying it.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.400 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Okazaki is really
strict about making
clever retorts.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.135 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Faint violin playing]
[Kotomi gasp]
[Nagisa] Why, sometimes even...

00:20:48.235 --> 00:20:51.338 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, is something
the matter, Kotomi?

00:20:51.939 --> 00:20:53.339 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hey, Kotomi!

00:21:02.748 --> 00:21:05.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, what do you want?

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-hey, Kotomi.

00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:08.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nishina] I'm sorry,
was I bothering you?

00:21:09.987 --> 00:21:12.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, no, really.
It's not anything like that.

00:21:13.057 --> 00:21:15.024 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nishina] What's the
matter with you?

00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:16.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] A violin...

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:17.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nishina gasp]

00:21:20.597 --> 00:21:23.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you... would you like to
play it for a while, maybe?

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:25.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] May I?
[Nishina] Sure.

00:21:25.969 --> 00:21:28.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Kotomi, you
can play the violin?

00:21:38.913 --> 00:21:40.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya gasp softly]

00:21:40.615 --> 00:21:44.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi plays poorly]
[Everyone yells]

00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:47.320 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Kotomi, stop! Stop!
[Nishina] You're putting too
much pressure on the strings!

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.258 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nishina] Relax your hold!
[Tomoya] Stop playing!
Stop playing!

00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:54.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Everyone yelling in pain]

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
[All gasp in relief]

00:21:59.564 --> 00:22:00.865 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's divine.

00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:04.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya, what is with her?

00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:06.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't ask me...

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
The shock almost destroyed me!

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Why?

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think I got it.

00:23:47.157 --> 00:23:48.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day after tomorrow,
on Monday,

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:51.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're making your debut
playing the violin.

00:23:51.128 --> 00:23:52.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] But why?

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure she's
giving a concert?

00:23:55.598 --> 00:23:59.936 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, don't you worry.
She's become quite
proficient at playing it.

00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:01.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Why?

00:24:01.938 --> 00:24:03.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, so anyway...

00:24:03.472 --> 00:24:06.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like you and
I are all alone now.

00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:07.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what do you wanna do?

00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:09.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm going
to take a nap.

00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:10.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kotomi] Why?
