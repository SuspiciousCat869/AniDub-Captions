00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:31,442
[AIKA]
Kimito? You're in there, right?

2
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,108
I'm coming in!

3
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,192
[gasps]

4
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,733
Well. What's up?
You asked me here.

5
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:50,650
So, uh. You wanted to
talk to me in private?

6
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:55,192
Yeah... It's best if
it's just you and me.

7
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,650
[gasps]

8
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,942
Oh... Is that why you
lied to the other girls?

9
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,733
And why you told them
you were busy today

10
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:05,067
and that all club
activities were cancelled?

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,817
Yes.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,442
[gasps]

13
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,317
[AIKA gasps]

14
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,483
[KIMITO]
What are you so nervous about?

15
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,400
Hey. You shut up!
I can't help it, okay?

16
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,567
[KIMITO]
We're good friends.

17
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,400
You don't have to
be nervous around me.

18
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,400
[gasps]

19
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,608
[AIKA]
What do you mean?

20
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,650
[KIMITO]
I mean exactly what I said.

21
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,775
Now. Come and sit over here.

22
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:08,817
[gasps]

23
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,733
Whoa. What the heck is that?

24
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,317
[KIMITO]
A present.

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,858
[gasps]
No way!

26
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,358
[KIMITO] Hey, I'm being
generous here!

27
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,233
[AIKA gasps] I didn't
mean that to sound bad.

28
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,525
But why?

29
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,858
It made me think
of you. That's all.

30
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,900
[gasps]

31
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:37,858
[KIMITO]
Open it.

32
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:48,067
[AIKA] It's a yellow tux
with a red bowtie?

33
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,442
Uh...

34
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,400
[KIMITO] Well, it's like
you're always telling me...

35
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,900
I wanna be popular,

36
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,858
and you're not doing anything
to help me out! You jerk!

37
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:55,775
[KIMITO]
True?

38
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:57,150
[AIKA]
Mm-hm.

39
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,858
[KIMITO] And you know what?
You're totally right.

40
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:01,108
That's why I'm
stepping up my game.

41
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,358
[AIKA]
Huh?

42
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,692
[KIMITO] That suit is
your super-secret weapon

43
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,442
to becoming the most
popular girl ever!

44
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,317
Super-secret weapon?

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,733
[KIMITO]
Damn right!

46
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,525
If you put on that outfit and
perform the song "Gets,"

47
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,733
everyone will worship
the ground you walk on!

48
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:15,900
[gasps]

49
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:16,942
[AIKA]
Kimito?

50
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,108
Huh?

51
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,025
I've kinda heard "Gets"
mentioned before.

52
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,108
What the heck is it anyway?

53
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,108
[KIMITO]
H-Hmm...

54
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:26,983
It's a Commoner greeting
that's catching fire.

55
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,442
Only the coolest peeps
get down with "Gets!"

56
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,817
Sounds fishy.

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,275
Why should I believe you?

58
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,067
You've tricked me too
many times in the past!

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,192
[KIMITO]
I have?

60
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,692
[AIKA]
Duh!

61
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,150
[KIMITO] Okay, maybe I've
pulled your leg once or twice

62
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,692
but this time I'm dead serious!

63
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,317
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself. Here.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,358
[gasps]

65
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,442
[AIKA]
Who is that guy?

66
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,608
The bad ass in the
suit is Dandy Sakano.

67
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,650
He's the founding
father of 'Gets.'

68
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,567
And now that his dance
is sweeping the nation,

69
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,817
He's become a
full-blown celebrity.

70
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,358
It's the truth. He's wearing
a bright yellow suit.

71
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:02,692
And he's doing a dance!

72
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:03,483
[KIMITO]
Check this!

73
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,525
[gasps]

74
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,692
[AIKA] There are 388,000
hits for Dandy Sakano?

75
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:15,233
[KIMITO 388,000 hits means
there are 388,000 pages

76
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:16,442
written about Dandy,

77
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,942
which means this guy
is a big freakin' deal!

78
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:21,400
I didn't even know someone
could be that popular!

79
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,317
This is insane!

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,483
[KIMITO]
Now watch what happens

81
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,692
when you search for
the keyword "Gets."

82
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,317
781,000 hits for "Gets?"

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,817
Amazing! So amazing!

84
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,983
Looks like "Gets" is catching on
with a crazy diverse audience!

85
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,317
You're absolutely right,

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,650
everyone is calling "Gets"
the next one hit wond--

87
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,025
I mean, the biggest handshake
greeting to hit the world

88
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:47,150
since the fist-bump!

89
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,567
It's that hot?

90
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,108
Yup.

91
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,525
And guess which comedian gave
birth to this magical move?

92
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:57,192
That's right, Dandy
Sakano himself.

93
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,567
Wait! What in the
heck is a comedian?

94
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,608
Huh?

95
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,900
[KIMITO] Someone whose job
is to make people happy!

96
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,483
That sounds totally cool!

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,900
[KIMITO] Okay. I've told you
everything you need to know.

98
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,567
You know what you
have to do now, right?

99
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,317
[AIKA] Yeah! I have to
put this thing on, pronto!

100
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,483
[giggles]

101
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,733
You're awesome.
You're crushing it!

102
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,358
In fact, I think I'm gonna
call you Dandy Aika!

103
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:27,608
Wait, Dandy Aika? That's like
the coolest name ever!

104
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:30,192
[gasps, giggles]

105
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,233
Gets--

106
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:32,233
That it?

107
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,608
[KIMITO]
Hm... No good.

108
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,983
You have to spread
your legs a bit more.

109
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,317
[AIKA gasps]
Oh yeah, good call.

110
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,358
[KIMITO] Also. Get low,
and crouch for me.

111
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,400
Right!

112
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,108
Gets... Gets... Gets!

113
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,733
That's good! You're totally
nailing it right now!

114
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,108
[AIKA] Okay, let's
go show the others!

115
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:55,150
Next, the advanced form!

116
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:59,233
First. "Gets". Then you spin
around and land like this!

117
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:02,608
Gets! Spin around...
Then... I land like this!

118
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,942
[KIMITO]
Yes, but faster!

119
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,067
Gets! Spin around!

120
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,775
[KIMITO]
Faster!

121
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,358
Gets! Spin!

122
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,733
Good job! That's a
little move they call

123
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,192
The "Gets-and-turn Delight!"

124
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,650
This is so cool!

125
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,567
Now, put on a
hardcore smug face,

126
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,817
lift your left hand and
right knee like this.

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,400
And you strut on
outta there, backwards.

128
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,025
Come on, Aika,
it's your turn!

129
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,442
Show me how you make an exit!

130
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,400
[AIKA]
Like this?

131
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:24,608
Don't speak!

132
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:25,650
[AIKA grunts]

133
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,692
That was perfect!
You are Dandy Aika!

134
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:34,108
All right! I really
did it! Yeah!

135
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,942
--I totally rule!
--[KIMITO] Mission accomplished.

136
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,442
Now I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

137
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,067
Tell Aika the truth and get
beaten to a bloody pulp again.

138
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,692
I'm gonna show
everyone my new moves

139
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,858
and they'll love me forever!

140
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,733
No, Aika, don't go!

141
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:48,650
Hey! Wait!

142
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,858
[KIMITO gasps, yells]

143
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:55,692
[grunts]

144
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,400
[KIMITO]
What is this?

145
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:01,650
Wait. I know exactly
what this is.

146
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,942
But these things don't just
run around on their own.

147
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,150
Anyone but Kujo.

148
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,025
[KUJO]
What are your intentions?

149
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,650
[KIMITO]
No...

150
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,192
Screw it. If I'm gonna
lose my balls anyway,

151
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,817
I might as well get
a good clean look

152
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,858
while I still have the
faculties to enjoy it.

153
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,775
And what a look it is.
To think that such a cold,

154
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:23,858
sharp person could be so warm
and smooth, and unmoving.

155
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:26,983
Shouldn't she be, like,
prepping for the operation?

156
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,858
And where the hell has she
been keeping the scissors

157
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,108
if not here? Oh no!
they're already out!

158
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,108
[KIMITO yelps, gasps]

159

Uh! I did not mean
to touch you there!

00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,567
It is not so much
"where" I was violated.

161
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,025
But rather "by whom" I was
violated that most concerns me.

162
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,733
As you know,
this is of the utmost

163
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,567
psychological significance.

164
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,775
You've graced me with a
peek into your fetid psyche.

165
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,108
Thank you so much, Kimito.

166
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:56,608
[KIMITO]
Wait! Just hear me out!

167
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,525
[KUJO] I shall admit
myself for counseling now.

168
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,858
[KIMITO]
I'm sorry!

169
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,483
Oh yeah. I have to find Aika!

170
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,858
[gasps] Am I to understand
you gave the item that arrived

171
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,817
this very morning to Miss Aika?

172
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,317
Why would you
do such a thing?

173
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,650
[KIMITO] Hm? It's something for
the Commoner Club, is all.

174
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,108
[KUJO]
I know what you're doing.

175
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:15,150
[KIMITO]
Uh...

176
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,942
Every waking moment,
your libido consumes you.

177
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,317
Driving you to commit
petty heterosexual acts.

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,692
Such behaviors are often
seen in the fumbling efforts

179
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,150
of grade school boys trying to
get in with the girls they like.

180
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,108
[KIMITO]
How would you know?

181
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,525
Don't be coy with me.

182
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:32,483
What? I would never!
I love muscles!

183
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,233
So that encounter did nothing
for you, you're sure.

184
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,108
[grunts]
You bet I am.

185
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,650
Muscles are the only
thing that get me goin'!

186
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,650
[KUJO] Is that right?
What a relief to hear.

187
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:44,608
[sobs]

188
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,942

[AIKA hums]

190
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,858
Goodness me! What are
you wearing Aika?

191
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,108
This?

192
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,358
It's a "none-of-your-
businness outfit." Bye!

193
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:59,942
[gaps]
Hold on! Not so fast!

194
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,692
Why would this be
none of my business?

195
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:05,025
I've never seen a person run
that fast in my life! Weird!

196
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:08,650
Weird? What's "weird" is that
ridiculous suit you're wearing!

197
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,650
[AIKA grunts]

198
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,108
Please. My outfit's not weird,
it's the coolest ever!

199
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,817
But, it's so yellow!

200
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,317
I'm dressed up like
a famous Commoner

201

who wrote an awesome
song called--

[scoffs, inhales]

203
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,608
Gets!

204
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,608
Well, that's... Quite odd.

205
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:33,483
t's not odd, ya weirdo!
It's the most popular greeting

206
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,150
to hit the Commoner world
since the freakin' fist-bump.

207
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,192
Cool, huh? A comedian named
Dandy Sakano created it,

208
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,108
and this is what he wears
in all his viral videos.

209
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,442
And you learned about
all this from Kimito?

210
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,942
[AIKA] Yep. And not only that,
he bought me this outfit too!

211
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,983
Isn't that thoughtful.

212
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,817
[sobs]

213
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,983
So? How do I look? Pretty great?

214
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,650
Yes, indeed. The yellow
color is vibrant.

215
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,525
And the fact that you're
wearing a man's tuxedo

216
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:03,525
gives it an additional
comedic flair.

217
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:04,608
To think that you
would receive

218
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,858
such an incredible
gift from Kimito.

219
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,233
I'll admit, I am
quite envious, Aika.

220
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,817
Uh. Well. Since you
like it so much,

221
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,608
I could ask him to get you one.

222
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,942
[REIKO]
You would do that?

223
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,150
Sure.

224
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,942
[REIKO]
Thank you very much!

225
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,483
No problem at all.

226
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,150
[REIKO]
That gesture you made.

227
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,733
I assumed, apparently wrongly,

228
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,942
that this was something
you invented entirely.

229
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,858
[AIKA] No way! "Gets" is
a global, internet sensation.

230
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,067
Over seven hundred thousand
people have watched--

231
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,692
Seven hundred thousand?!
Goodness me!

232
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,817
Well. I'll try. Here I go.

233
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,692
Gets!

234
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:40,567
So very wrong.

235
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,650
[DANDY SAKANO]
Gets!

236
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,317
[REIKO]
So? Like this?

237
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,567
[AIKA] Yeah. But,
move your hands just a bit.

238
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,108
[REIKO gasps]
This?

239
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,358
[AIKA]
Mm-hm.

[sighs]

244
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,692
This is how the Commoners
greet each other?

245
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:05,442
What can I say?
It feels so liberating!

246
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,942
I know!

247
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,817
We cannot keep
this to ourselves.

248
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,983
Let's share the gift of this
wonderful Commoner greeting

00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,525
with the rest of the
students here at Seikain!

Hey! Aika!

Geez. Where the heck did she go?

It's Kimito!

Huh?

00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:28,817
Oh, I hope he
likes our suits!

Yeah!

Uh...

262
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,317
What perfect timing. We just
finished teaching the others

263
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,358
how to do the world
famous dance, "Gets!"

264

Everybody learned it!

265
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,692
So now all of us can be
popular in the Commoner world!

all girls' school, right?

Well, yeah, obviously, I thought
I had it made at first.

But then I realized something,

something I never
thought possible.

You know, like when we're
wrestling or playing sports.

and show our muscles.

"Kimito wants to go home?"

and he said when he's around

girls he can't
be his true self.

298

He said he misses
being around other men!

299
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,150
Hold on. Does that mean
he misses muscles, too?

300
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:59,108
Indeed. I heard him say
something to that effect.

301
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:02,275
Does this mean that
he's going away?

Not if we can help it, no.

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,650
Let us brainstorm.
We will stop this.

305
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,275
[KAREN]
But, what can we possibly do?

306
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,942
[gasps]
I have a plan!

307
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,400
Kimito misses men,
so we should become men!

308

[KAREN]
Uh?

[REIKO]
Whatever do you mean?

310
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,733
It's so simple. We butch
ourselves up a bit.

311
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,150
And we fill the hole guys
have left in his life!

312
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,442
I see it now.

313
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,608
To satisfy his craving
for male company,

314
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,650
we must become
masculine ourselves.

315
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,983
Perfect. To keep Kimito
from leaving us,

316
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,650
we must do whatever it takes.

317
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,608
Even if that means
abandoning our femininity!

00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,775
[ALL]
Yeah!

319
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,150
Then again...

320
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,025
I will admit. I've no earthly
idea where to begin.

321
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:44,233
[AIKA]
Uh...

322
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:49,275
That's tough. Let's see.
Well we, uh-- We...

323
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,858
We could act like Kimito.

324
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:54,192
Well played! After all,
Kagurazaka is the only

325
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,400
male figure with whom
we are all familiar.

326
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,233
[HAKUA]
Um?

327
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,525
And it's like they say,

328
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,067
"Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery!"

329
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,567
Hey! Good call! Yep.
That's exactly what they say!

330
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,317
[laughs]

331
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,067
But how do we imitate him? Hm.

332
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,358
I'm totally drawing
a blank on that one.

333
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,608
Same here.

334
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,150
Now that you mention it,
this is quite difficult.

335
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,400
[KAREN]
Watch me.

336
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,192
I know a sure fire way
to imitate Kagurazaka.

337
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,192
[KAREN]
Like this!

338
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,317
Uh. Was that it?

339
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,192
It's quite subtle, but the key
is where you choose to look.

340
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,650
He never stares
straight into your eyes.

341
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,525
His gaze is always lowered!

342
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,900
That is so true!

343
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,233
Yes, that's right!

344
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,275
Kimito almost never looks
me directly in the eyes

345
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,525
when we are conversing.

346
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:41,983
We should try it!

347
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:42,983
Right!

I've got it! I thought of
a way to imitate Kimito!

00:15:55,775 --> 00:16:00,650
I love muscles!

Wow!

00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,442
Excellent work!
That was classic Kimito!

I will attempt it
as well! Here goes!

So, so much.

00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,733
But, I do get the feeling
something is not quite right.

this is fun!

[REIKO] Yes, it is.
But that's beside the point.

I don't know what it is,

379
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,608
but I sense something
critical is missing.

00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:09,567
Wait a sec!

Do you know what
we're lacking?

00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:13,692
Yes, I do!

384
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,650
The men in those videos
were strong, oily and muscular.

385

Meanwhile, we're just a bunch
of adolescent little girls!

Excellent point!
A critical difference, indeed!

387
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,817
[AIKA]
Kimito loves muscles.

388
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,525
If we wanna keep him here,
then we gotta buff up fast!

389
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,400
That's an excellent idea.

393

This is certainly realistic.

394
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,483
[HAKUA]
Big muscles.

395
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,650
Indeed. I'm sorry there's
only one of them.

Welp! I'll wear it then!

00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,900
Ah! That's not fair, Aika.
Just because the muscle shirt

398
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,775
was your idea, does not mean you
are entitled to put it on first!

We may be men,

So wrong.

You look like a sad young

I am a girl,
what do you expect?

Hair's long.

417

Yes. True.

418
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,150
You should cut your hair so it
looks the same as Kimito's.

419
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,150
[KAREN] No. We have
to give Kimito

420
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:43,442
the ultimate male experience.
Which means this...

421
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,817
Wait. You mean Samurai hair?

422
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,192

Yes. Exactly.

Put this on and he will
never miss men again.

The Samurai is the pinnacle
of Japanese masculinity.

425
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:57,233
[REIKO gasps] That leaves
the issue of clothing.

426

We cannot have you
wearing a short skirt.

00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:03,608
[ALL]
Uh...

478
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:06,692
What's going on here?
Why are you acting weird?

479
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,733
We dressed up like this cause
you said you were gonna leave!

480
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:24,358
[gasps]

481
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:25,942
What do you mean, leave?

482
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,525
[AIKA] Well. You're homesick and
you hate going to school here,

483
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,317
so you're leaving, right?

484
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,900
[KIMITO]
What?

485
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:33,858
It's what you said. And then you
said you couldn't be yourself

486
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,608
because there were
too many girls here.

487
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:38,567
Yeah, and that's
why I-- Uh, I mean.

488
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,442
That's why we decided to
butch things up a little!

489
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,942
This should tide you over.

490
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,733
[sighs]
You look ridiculous.

491
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:49,358
Hey!

492
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,192
But Kimito!

493
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,983
Look, We did this for you!

494
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,608
Yeah. Thanks for the thought.

495
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,067
[ALL gasp]

496
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,275
You don't have to
worry about me.

497
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:03,483
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,608
I'm definitely
staying at Seikain.

499
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,983
[GIRLS sigh]

500
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,692
[KAREN] I am so glad I
can still kill you one day!

501
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,442
[REIKO]
We're just glad you're staying.

502
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,025
You got me mad now!

503
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,233
[KIMITO] Seriously, you don't
have to do that! I'm staying.

504
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,483
It's over!

505
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:17,650
[HAKUA]
"Gets."

506
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:49,817
I can tell you've
been to the gym.

507
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,067
How can you tell?

508
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,358
[HAKUA]
Locks are released.

509
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,025
You stay away from Reiko,
Filthy Commoner!

510
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,400
[HOKO] Your marriage talks
have officially concluded!

511
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,692
You can't leave, what will
I do without you here?

512
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:02,483
[REIKO] From now on, if it's
all right, please call me Rei.
