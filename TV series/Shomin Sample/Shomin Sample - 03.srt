00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,625
[SAKIMORI] I am taking you
to the lab of Hakua Shiodome.

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,250
From today forward,
she's in your charge.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,666
Yes. Right.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,416
Taking care of Miss Hakua
carries with it

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,125
special rules and obligations
that are separate

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,291
from the needs of the other
ladies at this school,

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,625
so please familiarize
yourself with them at once.

8
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,333
To what rules and obligations
do you refer, ma'am?

9
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,000
She cannot dress
herself on her own,

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,916
and therefore
requires assistance.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,833
[SAKIMORI]
That task will fall to you.

12
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:32,833
Yes of course.

13
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,083
Her diet is very strict,

14
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,000
and she must be fed from
a rigid, preset menu.

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,541
Other than those specific meals,

16
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,333
she will not eat
anything at all.

17
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,458
Understood?

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,791
I will do my best.

19
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,916
Now then.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,833
It's time for you
to meet Miss Hakua.

21
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,541
With all my being,
I wish you'd never woken up.

22
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,291
How are you adjusting?

23
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,875
Have you grown accustomed
to life at Seikain yet?

24
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,083
No way.

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,458
I don't know if I'll
ever feel settled here.

26
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,833
[phone ringing]

27
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,375
[KIMITO]
"Hot spring woo-hoo"?

28
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,541
What does that mean?

29
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,875
Oh dear, was that
not explained to you?

30
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,000
You see, as a way
of thanking you

31
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,250
for agreeing to be
our Shomin Sample,

32
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,458
we have dramatically renovated
your childhood home.

33
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,125
Your bathroom has been
made into a natural hot spring.

34
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,791
Needless to say, your family
members are quite ecstatic.

35
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,208
[KIMITO] They sold me out
for a natural hot spring?!

36
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,583
In any case,

37
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,875
to ensure your family isn't
worried about you,

38
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,166
you should send them a text

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,458
telling them how much you
enjoy your new home.

40
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,666
"It's wall-to-wall
muscles over here.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,166
Having lots of fun."

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,208
[KIMITO yells]

43
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,875
If I come out
to my family,

44
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
it'll be on my own terms!

45

[STUDENTS chattering]

46
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,041
[ENGLISH TEACHER 2A]
Mr. Kagurazaka.

47
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,750
Would you do the honors, please?

48
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,958
Uh... Okay.

49
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,625
[STUDENTS chattering]

[STUDENT 3A]
Ladies! There he is!

51
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,083
[STUDENT 3B]
Look!

52
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,208
He's resting his hand
on the doorknob!

53
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,916
[KIMITO] Come on, can't I
use the bathroom in peace?

54
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,291
[KIMITO]
Huh?

55
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,375
[KIMITO] Is that girl
a student here?

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,208
What is she doing,
writing graffiti?

57
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,666
[KIMITO] I can't just let her
deface school property.

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,791
[KIMITO yelps]

[KIMITO screeches]

60
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,166
[KIMITO]
Nope, nope, nope!

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,375
You're not doin' that!

62
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,583
[KIMITO] Please keep
your clothes on.

63
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,583
You're gonna catch a cold.

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,125
[STUDENT 3C]
Yes, that's correct.

65
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,750
I read primarily Heine, Rilke,
and Verlaine from the list.

66
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,250
[STUDENT 3D] My, you are
quite the avid reader!

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,375
[KIMITO]
Perfect...

68
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,750
That sure was a close one.

69
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,166
If they'd seen us like that...

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,916
Well, they would've
taken it the wrong way.

71
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,875
So could you
get dressed already?

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,458
Or, uh...

73
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,625
They're all gone.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,708
[KIMITO]
Wait... Who is?

75
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,708
Was it you
who undressed me?

76
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,625
[KIMITO]
Nope! You did that yourself!

77
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,916
[HAKUA]
That sounds unlikely.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,666
What would I need
to get undressed for?

79
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,250
[KIMITO]
How am I supposed to know?

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,375
[KIMITO]
Look, just do me a favor

81
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,000
and put your
clothes on, okay?

82
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,291
[HAKUA] Sorry, but I can't
comply with that request.

83
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,625
Why not?

84
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,541
[HAKUA]
I'm unable to dress myself.

85
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,125
[KIMITO gasps]
You're kidding, right?

[HAKUA sneezes]

87
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,708
[KIMITO] You can't do
the buttons, either, eh?

88
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,208
[KIMITO] Man. This is harder
than I thought it would be.

89
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,291
There. All done.

90
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,125
By the way,
I'm Hakua Shiodome.

91
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,208
Cool. My name's
Kimito Kagurazaka.

92

[HAKUA]
Kimito?

93
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,458
You probably saw me
at the orientation meeting?

94
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,666
I missed it.
I was in my lab all day.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,291
[KIMITO]
Your lab?

[stomach growling]

That sound alerts me when
I have low blood sugar levels.

98
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,875
[KIMITO] In that case we should
get you something to eat.

99

[stomach growling]

100
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,708
I know what to do.

101
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,916
What food is this?

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,583
[KIMITO] Instant ramen.
Classic meal of the Commoner.

103
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,333
[KIMITO] But it's not
just instant ramen.

104
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
It's my original recipe.

105

"Chilled Chili-oil Delight."

106

You're gonna love it, trust me!

107
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,416
But I can't.

108
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,125
[KIMITO]
Uh... Bet you can.

109
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,791
C'mon, just try it.
It's awesome.

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,791
[KIMITO]
Just a bite?

111
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,416
It's really good.

112
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,041
[KIMITO]
What do you know?

113
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,375
You can eat by yourself.

114
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,583
[KIMITO]
Well?

115
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,791
[HAKUA]
It's edible.

116
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,708
[KIMITO] Well, it's time we got
you back to your own dorm.

117
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,000
How about I walk you there?

118
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,625
Okay no, I cannot have
her sleeping in my room.

[KIMITO] Ow! Don't stand up
so suddenly, okay?

[KIMITO]
Not again!

naked in my room!

I know this looks bad,
but please listen!

Believe it or not, I was trying
to keep her clothes on her!

[KIMITO]
Listen...

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,291
You should really learn how
to dress yourself, okay?

133
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,291
[KIMITO] You said it's
this way, right?

134
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,333
Come on.

135

[HAKUA]
You're coming home with me?

I'm just walking you there.

[HAKUA]
There it is.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,333
[SAKIMORI]
I see.

140
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,291
So you escorted Miss Hakua
all the way here, did you?

141
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,250
I owe you my sincere thanks.

142
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,291
Now then...

143
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,708
[KIMITO]
Huh? A digital camera?

144
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,041
[SAKIMORI]
Yes.

145
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,625
It's extremely important
that we record everything

146
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,125
that Miss Hakua writes down.

147
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,458
As such, we must take a
picture of that courtyard.

148
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,833
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,125
[SAKIMORI]
You don't know?

150
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,000
Miss Hakua
participates globally

151
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,000
in the science and
technology industries,

152
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
as well as other
extremely important fields

153
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,291
of academic study.

154
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,583
Even now, prominent businessmen
from around the world

155
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,416
await her conclusions and
theories with baited breath.

156
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,875
Wow!

157
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,291
She's a true genius.

158
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,541
In fact, this complex
was erected using funds

159
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,958
earned from her
innovative patents

160
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,916
and cutting edge technologies.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,166
Now, Miss,

162
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
let's make sure we
get you something to eat.

163
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,333
[KIMITO] Oh. There's no need for
that, she just ate at my place.

164
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,833
[SAKIMORI gasps]

165
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,750
[KIMITO]
Should she not have?

166
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,833
No...

167
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,791
Hakua, is this really true?

168
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,125
Have you eaten?

169
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,375
Did I do something wrong?

170
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,916
[SAKIMORI]
No, no!

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,250
But tell me,
what did you feed her?

172
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,916
[KIMITO] Instant ramen.
I made it myself.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,250
It's a pretty good recipe.

174
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,458
[SAKIMORI]
Ramen?

175
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,541
[KIMITO]
Ramen.

176
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,583
[SAKIMORI]
Well... Thank you.

177
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,083
You sir, are far too kind!

178
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,541
Gotta go. Bye!

179
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,791
[KIMITO]
What's wrong?

180
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,166
Please don't leave.

181
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,208
[KIMITO]
Are you all right?

182
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,625
Me? Yes!

183
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,958
[KIMITO]
But why?

184
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,416
'Cause I'll miss you.

185
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,875
[KIMITO]
You sure you're all right?

186
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,916
[SAKIMORI]
Oh, perfect!

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,875
Please don't let me
get in the way

188
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,541
of your private conversation!

189
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,750
[KIMITO] Come over and
visit me sometime. Yeah?

190
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
[HAKUA]
Okay.

191
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,583
[KIMITO]
Cool. Bye.

192
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,625
[HAKUA]
I'll visit soon.

193
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,291
[MAID 3A]
Are you in earnest, Madam?

194
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,958
[SAKIMORI] At first, I honestly
thought that it was all a dream!

195
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,708
I couldn't believe
what I was hearing!

196
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,125
[SAKIMORI] Little Hakua, who
won't put on her own panties!

197
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,208
The girl one who has
absolutely no interests

198
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,500
outside of reading
books about science!

199
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,166
She grabbed onto his
shirtsleeve and then she said,

200
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,416
"Please don't leave me." Wow!

201
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,875
[MAIDS]
"Wow" is right!

202
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,041
[HAKUA sneezes]

203
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,583
[SAKIMORI] It was amazing!
I was stunned.

204
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,583
And that's not the
only surprise, ladies.

205
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,000
Guess what she told me?

206
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,875
[SAKIMORI]
She said she already ate!

207
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,750
[MAIDS]
Huh?!

208
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,000
But that's impossible.

209
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,541
I thought Miss Hakua
wouldn't eat anything

210
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,750
that wasn't on her pre-set menu.

211
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,291
Today is Wednesday, so it's
scallops au gratin day,

212
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,416
is it not?

213
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,791
This is truly a
remarkable occasion!

214
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,916
Get this. She ate
the Commoner's ramen!

215
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,916
[MAID 3B] Has she ever
deviated from the plan before?

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,791
[SAKIMORI]
No. Not even once!

217
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,541
[MAID 3B] Do you think it's
possible she has a crush

218
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,916
on the young man?

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,166
[MAID 3C] Doubtful.
It's Hakua we're talking about.

220
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,500
[MAID 3B] But she is a girl,
and appearances aside,

221
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,791
she is fourteen.

222
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,583
It's only natural.

223
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,791
[SAKIMORI giggles]

224
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,333
It appears we won't
be able to take our eyes

225
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,708
off the young miss anymore,
will we, ladies?

226
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
[REIKO]
Kimito.

227
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,041
Are you feeling prepared
for the botany test today?

228
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,625
I'm not exactly
an expert flower-arranger.

229
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,125
There's no reason
to fret, you'll be just fine.

230
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,166
Besides, if you require
any assistance,

231
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,708
I'd be happy to give it.

232
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,208
You can ask me for help
anytime you so desire.

233
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
[KIMITO] Thanks,
I'll take you up on that.

234
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,000
[REIKO]
Now and forever.

235
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:14,916
[KIMITO]
Uh...

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,958
[REIKO]
Oh!

237
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,166
[STUDENTS chattering]

238
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,291
What's up?

239
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,166
[KIMITO] Why is that girl
wearing a katana?

240
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,125
[KAREN shrieks]

241
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,625
Die, you filthy insect!

242
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,500
Stay still so I can kill you!

243
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,791
[KAREN]
Die! Die! Die!

244
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,333
[KIMITO yells]

245
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,375
[STUDENTS yell]

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,791
[KAREN crying]

247
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,708
I loathe bugs with a passion.

248
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,166
[KAREN gasps]

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,750
I simply can't believe
she had the boldness

250
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,625
to insult and
attack the Commoner!

251
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,750
No doubt about it,
Karen is a formidable lady!

252
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,166
She's not formidable.
She's just a nut job!

253
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,083
[KAREN]
Silence!

254
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,333
[KAREN]
You worthless bug!

255
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll slay you here and now!

256
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,208
[KIMITO]
Talk about crazy eyes!

257
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,625
[KAREN]
Shut up, you pond scum!

258
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,500
[KIMITO] Which is it,
am I a bug or pond scum?

259
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,750
[KAREN]
Don't correct me!

260
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,541
[KIMITO] Who the heck
are you anyway, lady?

261
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,291
My name is Karen Jinryo!

262
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,208
And I'm the lady who's going
to smite you with my blade.

263
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,125
Time for you to die!

264
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,541
Kimito, look out!

265
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,708
I'd run away!

266
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,458
[KIMITO yelling]

267
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,958
Prepare yourself, Commoner.

268
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
Today you breathe
your last breath--

269
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,666
Karen style sword art!

270
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,833
Resolution!

271
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,250
[KIMITO yelling]

272
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,208
Who said you
could avoid my attack?

273
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,583
Like I need permission!

274
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,708
[KIMITO yelling]

275
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,541
You're a nimble
little pond scum.

276
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,958
No. Bug!

277
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,458
[KIMITO] Still haven't made up
your mind about that?

278
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,708
You shut your mouth!

279
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,458
I know what to do with you.

280
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
[KAREN]
Karen style sword art.

281
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,166
Whirlwind Number Fifty-Eight:

282
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,208
Abundance!

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,916
[STUDENTS screaming]

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,833
Don't look at us,
you pervy Commoner!

285
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,250
[REIKO]
Oh my goodness.

286
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,208
Kimito's seen my
immodesty yet again,

287
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,416
how will I ever live
with such shame?

288
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,708
[KIMITO] How did she
make that happen?

289
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,708
This is nuts!

290
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
[KAREN]
You disgraceful man!

291
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,916
How dare you
be so shameless?

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,458
[KIMITO]
That was you, not me!

293
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,625
[STUDENTS screaming]

294
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,041
[KIMITO screams]

295
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:49,875
You bug!

296
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,541
You miserable, obscene bug!

297
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,750
No, please! Don't kill me!
I'm too young!

298
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,333
Damn it.
I have to fight back.

299
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,708
What choice do I have?

300
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,708
[KAREN]
I'll finish you!

301
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
[KIMITO]
Here goes nothing!

302
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,541
[KIMITO, KAREN yelling]

303
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,291
[KIMITO]
She sees it...

304
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,541
My Eden...

305
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,375
[KIMITO]
Hey. Are you all right?

306
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,708
Tell me.

307
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,250
How well do you
measure up compared

308
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,750
to other Commoner boys?

309
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,250
[KIMITO]
Hmm?

310
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,458
Answer me!

311
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,375
[KIMITO]
Uh...

312
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,583
Yeah, I'm one of
the weaker ones.

313
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,083
[KAREN]
Weak? No!

314
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,625
So the "Karen style"
I devised is futile

315
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,833
against the weakest
of the Commoner men?

316
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,000
[KIMITO]
You're self-taught?

317
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,750
That's amazing!

318
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,083
And by the way, I didn't say
I was the weakest one.

319
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,541
I cannot accept this!
I demand a rematch!

320
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,875
[KIMITO]
Again?

321
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,875
I must cut you down
and restore my sullied name!

322
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,791
[KIMITO]
No! Wait!

323
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,833
Die!

324
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,791
[KAREN]
Whoa... But how?

325
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,666
I didn't even see you attack me.

326
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,125
Uh, actually, I'm
pretty sure that wasn't me.

327
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,000
I think you did
that to yourself.

328
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,416
[KAREN]
And you're the weakest?

329
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
Unbelievable.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,708
What savage people
you Commoners are.

331
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,916
I'm scared.

332
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,416
[KIMITO] I told you already,
I didn't do it.

333
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,333
You're the one who's been
slicing people's clothes off!

334
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,458
[KAREN]
So I did this?

335
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,666
How can that be?

336
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,125
[KIMITO]
I don't know.

337
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,250
[KAREN]
Wow...

338
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,000
[KIMITO]
You understand now?

339
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,958
[KAREN]
It's hopeless!

340
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,083
I am not worthy!

341
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,000
[KIMITO]
No, no, you are!

342
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,125
[KAREN]
All right.

343
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,750
As you've beat me
on the field of battle,

344
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,541
you are now my lord and master.

345
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,583
[KIMITO] I think you might
need professional help.

346
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,208
But always remember.

347
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,708
The moment you seem weaker
than me, I'll strike!

348
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
I'll kill you
on the spot, Bug!

349
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
[KIMITO] I've already got one
hell of a maid,

350
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,625
I don't need two!

351
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,958
[KAREN]
However, until then,

352
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,791
you may use me as you see fit.

353
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,833
[STUDENT 3H] I heard he
beat Karen into submission

354
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,750
and forced her
to become his servant!

355
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,958
[STUDENT 3I]
Commoners truly are incredible!

356
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,208
And savage, too!

357
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,833
[AIKA]
Look!

358
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,166
What's that?

359
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,291
My master plan
to become the most popular

360
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,166
and beloved girl
in all of Seikain!

361
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,708
I may not be very likeable,

362
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,208
and I'm certainly not very good
at inviting people to stuff,

363
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,416
but with this foolproof plan,
there's no way I can fail!

364
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,458
[AIKA laughs]

365
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,500
What's the matter?

366
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,916
You don't seem
too stoked about it.

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,125
No, I'm fine.

368
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,458
Right. So...

369
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,333
Anyway, what you do you
think of my awesome plan?

370
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,333
I don't think it's
a bad idea, really.

371
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,750
But it's tough to pull off.

372
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,916
I mean, first of all,

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,666
you're gonna need
a few dozen cell phones.

374
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,708
I think mine's
the only one of campus.

375
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,958
Well I was thinking you
could help me out with that!

376
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,708
Easier said than done.

377
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,875
If only there was somebody
at Seikain Girl's School

378
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,541
with a knack for science.

379
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,000
It could work.

380
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,291
[KIMITO]
Cool. So, Hakua,

381
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,833
have you done any work
with cell phones before?

382
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,333
Awesome!

383
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,375
And you definitely have a
bunch of samples in your lab?

384
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,375
It's settled then.

385
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,416
Lucky you.

386
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,833
[AIKA]
That's great and everything,

387
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,166
but why are you
sitting like that?!

388
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,291
She wouldn't budge when I asked.
Why don't you try?

389
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,125
You there! Remove your rump!

390
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,458
Despite her looks,
that girl's the same age as us.

391
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,416
Don't let her fool you!
Send her packing!

392
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,250
She's our age?
There's no way that's true.

393
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,208
Fine. I'll do it myself.

394
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,375
Hakua? Let's go sit
on a cushion, okay?

395
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,791
[AIKA groans]

396
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,208
What are you getting
so worked up about?

397
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,416
I am not getting worked up!

398
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Pardon me.

399
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,083
[KIMITO]
What do you want?

400
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,750
As I said before--Kimito!

401
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,916
You. This girl.

402
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,291
What's going on here?

403
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,750
[KAREN]
You pointless thing.

404
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,500
So pointless. So very pointless.

405
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,083
Pointless, pointless, pointless.

406
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,916
[KIMITO]
So why are you here exactly?

407
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,708
[KAREN]
As I said before, Master.

408
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,041
I now belong to you.

409
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,083
So I'll be here
for your every need.

410
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,166
And I'll stay by your side.

411
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,625
Always.

412
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,208
Till I grow strong enough
to strike you down at last.

413
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,208
Then you die.

414
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,083
[KIMITO]
Yep. You're totally nuts.

415
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,625
But in a charming way!

416
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,583
Now that you've thrust
that nasty, indecent thing

417
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,583
in my face,
I have to kill you!

418
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,250
[KIMITO]
I didn't thrust anything!

419
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,833
Ahem! 'Scuse me!

420
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:31,750
You're still here?

421
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,375
I've been here
this whole time!

422
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,916
It's like you want me to
punch you in your stupid face!

423
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,291
You really might
want to see someone

424
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,833
about that anger
problem of yours.

425
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,500
I don't have
an anger problem!

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,708
Look at the clock.

427
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,166
Isn't it club time?

428
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,166
[KIMITO]
Yeah.

429
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,666
Well, in that case.

430
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,958
They're dead weight, Kimito.

431
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,333
We need to ditch 'em.

432
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,666
The more the merrier, right?

433
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,875
[AIKA]
Wrong!

434
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,666
I don't get it,
what's the matter with you?

435
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,791
Oh, I don't know,

436
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,666
maybe it's the way
you just sit there--

437
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,583
[AIKA screams]

438
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,083
Perfect!

439
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,291
What's that?

440
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,500
[AIKA]
Her maid dropped this off!

441
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,833
What, is she moving in?

442
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,791
I had these
brought here for you.

443
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,750
Awesome job.

444
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,083
At present,

445
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,875
they're unable to connect
to cellular services.

446
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
Should I fix it so they can?

447
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,500
Please.

448
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,750
Actually, we want to
make it so these cells

449
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,583
can only connect
with each other.

450
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,666
Okay.

451
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
Aika, do you wanna pick first?

452
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,541
Huh? Uh, yeah. Sure.

453
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,958
[AIKA] Hey. Thank you for
helping us out, I guess.

454
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:41,750
Would you like one?

455
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,000
[KAREN]
Hmph.

456
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,500
I am not interested in
your infantile trinkets.

457
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,083
Suit yourself.

458
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,458
[AIKA] Kimito!
Take a picture of me!

459
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,958
[KIMITO]
All right. Here goes!

460
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,791
[camera snaps]

461
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,500
[AIKA]
Ooh! Check me out!

462
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,750
Wow!

463
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,541
I'm so adorable I wanna
squeeze my own head off!

464
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,708
Do you wanna
take a picture, too?

465
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,833
I would like to
take one with you, yes.

466
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,625
[AIKA] Then I want to
take one too, Kimito!

467
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,750
[KIMITO] There's not room
for all three of us!

468
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,916
[AIKA]
Of course there is!

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,416
Hey. No tugging.

470
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,750
You're way too close.

471
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,875
Stop making this weird!

472
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,416
You're the one
invading my space!

473
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,291
[AIKA]
Tell that to Hakua, hypocrite!

474
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,041
[KIMITO]
Uh, hey, Hakua.

475
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,125
Why are you sitting
on my lap again?

476
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,291
Considering circumstances,
this position's needed.

477
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,125
There's no way we'll
all fit in this frame.

478
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,041
Hey, I know!

479
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,250
Karen can ta--

480
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,333
[KAREN]
I...

481
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,000
I want to be
in the picture, too!

482
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,708
[chuckles]
All right.

483
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,000
Group selfie time.

484
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,875
[AIKA] Watch where you're
putting your grimy hands!

485
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,125
[KIMITO]
It's not me, I swear!

486
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,041
[KAREN] You could always
sit on my lap instead.

487
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,083
[KIMITO]
Me?

488
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,916
[KAREN]
Not you, you pond scum bug!

489
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,708
[KUJO]
Sleep well.

490
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,000
Please don't wake up tomorrow.

491
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,500
[KIMITO]
Yeah, yeah, good night.

492
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,541
[REIKO]
Heya!

493
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,666
[KIMITO]
A club entry form?

494
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,250
[KAREN] When did those two
get so chummy?

495
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,416
[KIMITO]
Uh... Sorry!

496
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,250
Have you forgotten
about my plan?!

497
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,666
[KAREN]
Everything's pointless!

498
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,833
I really hope everyone
has a good time at the party!

499
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:46,916
Idiot!
