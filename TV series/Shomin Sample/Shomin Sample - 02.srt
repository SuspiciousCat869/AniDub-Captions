[KIMITO]
Yeah.

You've no idea how much
I wish you'd never woken up.

Please don't take it personally,

8
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,291
but my morning chores
are quite burdensome.

then I'd have the morning off.

Yeah. That's very nice
and all, but I got it covered!

No, this is a tradition.

This duty has always been
carried out by a Seikain maid.

You may be a sexual
deviant, Commoner.

17
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,166
But rules are rules.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,625
And here at Seikain, you will
follow them no matter what.

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,041
[KIMITO]
That's right, I forgot.

20
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,833
If I don't act like a gay guy
with a muscle fetish,

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,458
then I'm totally screwed!

22
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,833
They'll kick me out and
ship me off to no man's land!

[KUJO] You're having disgusting,
immoral thoughts right now.

Ah, yes, I suppose.

[KUJO]
Right this way.

34

[KIMITO] How come we have to
go out through the back door?

Have you forgotten what
the reaction was like yesterday?

36

You create commotion.
I am trying to minimize it.

37
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,208
And as such,

38
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,958
till things calm down, this is
the best course of action.

No!

43
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,625
This is my door, Commoner.
Back off!

44
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,125
[STUDENT 2A]
Have you ladies heard anything

45
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,250
about this Commoner?

46
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,250
[STUDENT 2B]
No, but I'm dying to know!

47
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,458
[KUJO]
This way. Quickly.

48
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,541
[KIMITO]
I get it.

49
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,916
You always take the back door
to avoid other people, right?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
[AIKA]
Yeah.

51
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,916
But I gotta admit, you're the
last person I expected

to find sneaking to class.

53
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,166
Then again,
if we have this in common,

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,916
then clearly I have what it
takes to be popular, too!

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,208
Are you excited?

56
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,375

[KIMITO] Well...
It's this whole maid thing.

64
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,000
In the Commoner world,
that isn't a custom.

65
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,250
For real?

66
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,791
Strangely, Commoners
don't have maids.

67
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,000
So...

68
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,125
I'm telling you what
I know about Commoners.

69
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,291
What if in exchange,

70
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,500
you taught me how things
work around here?

71
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,541
That sounds like an even
trade don't'cha think?

72
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
Yeah, that sounds
like a job for Reiko.

73
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,666
She'll tell you everything
you need to know and then some!

74

Cause she's super fancy!

have me than Reiko?

I guess you just seem
more down to earth.

Reiko's nice and all,

crazy aura about her.

If she can be a friend to you,

161
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,583
then the fault of our
estrangement is mine.

162
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,791
[KIMITO] I kinda wanna tell her
that Aika just wants everyone

163
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,291
to be her friend.

164
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,083
But I probably shouldn't get in
the middle of their thing.

165
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,958
[KIMITO]
I don't think it's your fault.

166
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,208
Whatever the cause is,

167
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,875
I just hope you don't
start to dislike her.

168
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,916
Honestly, I think that
would be a shame.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
[REIKO]
How could I ever dislike her?

170
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,666
That's not possible.

171
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
[KIMITO]
Right.

172
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,583
[REIKO] But I do certainly
hope you are correct

173
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,083
in saying that
I haven't done anything

174
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,125
to incur Aika's displeasure.

175
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,833
If that's really true, I suppose
there's a ray of hope after all.

176
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,250
Hope's all I need.

177
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,208
In due time, I feel confident
we can all be friends.

178
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,375
I pray that you're right.

179
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,791
That would be
a dream come true.

180
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,041
Yes, it would.

181
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,833
We should do whatever
we can to make it so.

182
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,375
[KIMITO]
Whoa!

183
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,416
You're the guest of honor,
so you should lead the way.

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,416
[STUDENTS whispering]

185
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,791
[STUDENT 2E]
Here he is!

186
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
[STUDENT 2F] Is that really
how a Commoner walks?

187
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,083
[KIMITO]
Geez.

188
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,041
That's how closely
they're watching me?

189
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,583
[STUDENT 2G]
Look how he stumbled!

190
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,500
[STUDENT 2H] Is there some
meaning to the way he moves?

191
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,625
[KIMITO]
No!

192
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,041
What the heck?

193
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,458
This can't be Japanese.

194
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,041
I don't understand a word of it.

195
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,375
So, Kimito, what will
you be having for dinner?

196
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,166
The Japanese meal?

197
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,666
All right.

198
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,166
If that's what you're having,
then I shall do the same.

199
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,166
As shall I.

200
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,416
And so shall I!

201
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,750
As shall I, and I
couldn't be more excited!

202
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,875
[KUJO]
Thank you for your patience.

203
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,541
Hey, what the heck is this?

204
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,041
The Japanese meal.

205
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,291
I heard that Cup Men was the
staple food of the Commoner.

206
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,666
So out of regard for your ways.

207
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,041
That is stereotyping,

208
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,791
we don't all eat Cup Men
all the time.

209
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,166
You just clicked
your tongue again!

210
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Don't do that!

211
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,333
[KUJO] So then, you're
declining the Japanese Meal?

212
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,125
Yes! Of course I--

213
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,583
Pardon me, but--

214
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,708
[KIMITO]
What?

215
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,791
[REIKO] It has such
an unusual aroma.

216
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,583
Do you eat it? Like food?

217
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,291
You don't know
what Cup Men is?

218
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,125
"Cup Men"?

219
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,083
Well, you know what
ramen is, don't you?

220
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,250
[REIKO]
Oh yes. I've heard stories.

221
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,625
Geez. It's not a legend.

222
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,750
It's just ramen.
Instant ramen, actually.

223
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,625
In other words,
it's the easy version.

224
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,166
You just have to add hot water,
and you can eat it.

225
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,041
[STUDENTS] You just have
to add hot water?

226
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,875
So... That's all the
preparation it requires?

227
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,333
Oh Reiko, I do not
understand this Cup Men at all!

228
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,000
[MIZUHO] Why does the
container have so many words

229
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,333
written on top?

230
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,000
[MAYA] I have some antique
porcelain at my house

231
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,708
adorned with ancient script.

232
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,333
I suppose it's similar.

233
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,250
[KIMITO]
Well, anyway.

234
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,291
We eat this a lot 'cause
it's convenient and cheap.

235
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,333
[REIKO] My! It truly looks
like actual food!

236
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,666
So many ingredients!

237
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,333
I recognize that as shrimp.

238
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,916
But what are those weird yellow
and brown things in the broth?

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,333
Simply by adding hot water,

240
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,458
one can give it
this culinary form?

241
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,708
How is that possible?

242
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,458
I don't know.
Do you wanna try it out?

243
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,500
[STUDENTS gasping]

244
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,708
[KIMITO]
Uh...

245
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, Maya, please. Go ahead.

246
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,041
No, Kae. The honor is yours.

247
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,291
Ladies, please.

248
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,416
Let us not be impolite
to our guest.

249
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,833
This is a rare delicacy.

250
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,708
Let us all partake
in its wonder.

251
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,833
[STUDENTS]
Right!

252
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,250
If you would, Kujo?

253
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,833
As you wish, Miss Reiko.

254
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,250
[REIKO]
Just a moment, please.

255
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,166
If we are to receive such
a delicious treasure

256
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,791
as this from our honored guest,

257
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,833
then simple white porcelain
is far too uncivil.

258
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,708
[KIMITO]
Uh...

259
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,208
You know they're just noodles.

260
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,458
[REIKO] For this occasion,
let us use our best dishware!

261
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,500
[STUDENTS giggling, clapping]

262
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,166
So this is the
legendary "Cup Men"

263
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,083
Commoners eat for breakfast,
lunch and dinner?

264
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,291
Ooh! I do wonder
how it tastes!

265
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,291
The aroma is simply
lovely and exquisite!

266
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,958
[KIMITO] This is definitely
gonna be a massive letdown.

267
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,458
[REIKO] Thank you very much
for sharing, Kimito.

268
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,333
[KIMITO]
Yeah. Sure.

269
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,750
[REIKO] All right.
Let us all eat, then!

270
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,291
[STUDENTS]
Thank you for this meal!

271
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,958
[slurping]

272
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
[STUDENTS gasp]
This is so delicious!

273
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,500
[KIMITO]
Come on! Ramen?!

274
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
I've never tasted
anything like this!

275
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,666
Between the savory soup

276
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,250
and the texture of
the delicious noodles,

277
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,000
I honestly don't know what part
of the recipe I love the most!

278
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,458
It's wonderful.
And I want more!

279
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,541
[REIKO]
This is, without a doubt,

280
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,791
an unprecedented experience.

281
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,291
I shall never forget
these noodles or this day.

282
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,666
I swear.

283
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,041
I shall cherish this blessed
memory deep in my heart.

284
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,416
Thank you for bringing
this to us, Kimito!

285
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,583
[KIMITO]
I don't get it.

286
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,500
Why are noodles such
a big deal to them?

287
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,666
[AIKA sighs]
There really is nothing better

288
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,583
than eating lunch all by myself!

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,416
[REIKO]
Here we are at last.

290
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,958
Your welcoming party.

291
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,333
Are you surprised at this?

292
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,916
Yeah I am.

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,041
Thanks, Reiko. This is perfect.

294
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,916
Oh, well...
It's a passion of mine.

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,291
I do enjoy thinking up
delightful little gatherings

296
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,333
such as these.

297
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,791
Everyone,

298
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,250
a toast to Kimito for
transferring here!

299
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,333
[REIKO]
Hip, hip!

300
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,541
[STUDENTS]
Hooray!

301
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,583
Is something
the matter, Kimito?

302
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,291
[KIMITO]
What? No way.

303
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,291
I was just thinking
how awesome you are.

304
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,083
I mean, you put this whole
thing together, right?

305
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,750
[REIKO]
No, no.

306
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,875
You are the one who is
"awesome," as you say,

307
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,166
for you are well versed in a
myriad of customs unknown to us.

308
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,041
After learning of
your curious ways,

309
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,583
I feel as though a whole new
world has opened up for me.

310
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,000
Your compliments
fill me with such pride,

311
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,875
although I feel quite unworthy.

312
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,500
Forgive my boldness,
but would you care to dance?

313
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,875
[KIMITO]
Uh, oh, no. I don't dance.

314
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,625
Well, I never have before,
that is.

315
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,666
Commoners don't
go to things like this.

316
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,083
Fancy parties, I mean.

317

No. Please.

it out if you want!

Oh! Then I shall teach you.

00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,916
[REIKO]
Yes.

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,375
[KIMITO] You don't have to
worry about doing a good job

step on someone's foot, it's me.

Yeah. What do we have to lose?

teach me some peasant stuff!

[AIKA]
Say, Commoner.

What are all these things?

359
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,083
[KIMITO]
Are you kidding? Manga.

360

[AIKA]
What's manga?

361
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
[KIMITO]
You don't know manga?

362
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,833
How are you
supposed to read this?

Oh...

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,166
Let me think, I've never
had to explain it before.

365
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,208
Well, it's pretty
simple, actually.

366
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,500
You read it right to left.

367
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,333
And then top to bottom,
that make sense?

[AIKA]
"There must be..."

00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,291
[AIKA]
I'm a little surprised at you.

Why didn't you say something
about this before?

379
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,666
[KIMITO]
About what?

380
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,041
About how all

381
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,208
have special psychic
abilities, stupid!

[KIMITO]
No, it's too much.

There's no way she'd
believe that. Is there?

If they can be psychics,
then I can too!

388
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,041
Since Commoners can
develop special powers,

389
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,833
there's no reason
a lady like me can't!

Yep, it's official!

I'll reveal my avatar

From now on,

at the center of class

her every move!

You need to keep
it together, buddy.

Even once I've become the
most popular girl in school,

I'll still talk to you

Well... You'd better
start training right away.

First I awaken the
dormant avatar within me

and then I put her
under my spell.

from the manga.

[ENGLISH TEACHER 2A]
Now then. Let's not dillydally.

476
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,041
Let's get to work right away.

477
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,625
This is real dense.

478
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,791
Hard to engage, you know?

479
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,666
Us, engaged?

480
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
Oh, no.
It's far too soon for that.

481
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,583
But... Then again,
in my grandmother's day,

482
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,833
dropping out of school and
getting engaged at an early age

483
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,125
was quite commonplace, so...

484
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,416
[KIMITO]
What are you talking about?

485
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,875
Nothing.
Thinking out loud is all.

486
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,583
Please do continue.

487
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,083
Waiting for...

488
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,041
Our wedding day?

489
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,083
That seems early.

490
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,041
But all right. My answer's yes.

491
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,625
Never too early to plan.

492
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,750
But in order for the
ceremony to be perfect,

493
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,208
we'll have to start making
our arrangements right away.

494
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,916
Although, considering
how last minute this is,

495
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,833
I fear we'll run out of time
before we really get started.

496
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,500
[KIMITO] Why are you tearing
pages out of your book,

497
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,666
it's for learning.

498
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,208
Wait a sec, is that origami?

499
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,916
Why are you making origami out
of your frickin' textbook?

500
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,208
[REIKO]
"Travel." Yes.

501
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,291
Where should we go
on our honeymoon?

502
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,625
Domestic? Overseas?

503
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,666
[KAE] Reiko! What on earth
has come over you?

504
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,916
[KAREN]
My name is Karen Jinryo!

505
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,125
They're dead weight,
Kimito, we need to ditch them!

506
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,250
"It's wall-to-wall
muscles over here.

507
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,583
Having lots of
fun."

508
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,958
Was it you who undressed me?

509
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,708
How dare you
be so shameless!

510
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,333
Kimito, look out!

511
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,500
[KIMITO]
She sees it... my Eden...
