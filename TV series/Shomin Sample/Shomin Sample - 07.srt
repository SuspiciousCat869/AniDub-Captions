I want her to kick me
around a soccer field,

or punt me through
a pair of uprights

as wide as the space
between her thighs.

It's almost as if I'm
staring at a lunar eclipse

the rest of my days

chasing after that rump,
if for no other reason

102
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,208
than to watch it
bounce up and down,

103
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,500
and up and down again.

104

That bod is my Holy Grail,

105
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,083
and like King Arthur
on his steed

106

into the glorious sunset

of everlasting life!

Go on...
Laugh away if you feel inclined.

I've always been
self-conscious about them.

yourself down like that.

super annoying for you.

of new friends these days.

they'd pair up two people

who don't like each other.

148
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,125
But it'll be over soon enough.
Don't worry.

I don't particularly
care for you, either.

What are you so angry about?

You misunderstand,

your help with something.

[REIKO]
What is it?

gonna send to everybody.

Would you proofread it for me?

He's the expert on
all things Commoner.

This is something I would
rather have you check first.

an important message.

00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,041
It explains why I've been
so rude and standoffish

162
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,416
to the rest of the
class up until now.

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,625
Think you could help?

164
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,750
Why would you care
what I thought about it?

165
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,041
You're the most popular
girl in the whole school.

166
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,416
There's a reason why everyone
at Seikain loves you.

167
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,958
You're gentle and kind.

168
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,500
You genuinely care for others,

169
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,416
and you always seem
to do the right thing.

170
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,250
Also, there's something about
the way you choose your words.

171
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,916
It's like you know exactly what
to say to make people feel good.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,583
Reiko, I could really
use your help with this.

173
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,000
I know you and I aren't on
the best of terms right now,

174
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,208
but there's no one better
at this than you, so please?

175
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,416
I will assist you.

176
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,166
For real? Awesome!

177
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,833
[REIKO]
Heh... It's quite long...

178
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,000
I know! I'm a
pretty good texter, right?

179
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,000
[REIKO]
That wasn't a compliment!

180
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,416
I keep reading and reading,

181
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
but the main point of the
text never becomes clear.

182
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,000
Also, your opening apology
is a jumbling mess.

183
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,500
Please understand that I'm not
saying this to offend you.

184
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,708
But in my honest opinion,

185
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,375
this text message is
an unmitigated disaster!

186
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,125
[AIKA]
Yikes. Ya really think so?

187
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,166
[REIKO]
Yes, I do.

188
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,291
Make it less stilted
and more casual.

189
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,416
And if it were my text,

190
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,416
I would also edit it
down considerably.

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,375
[AIKA panting]

192
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,250
Take a look at this!

193
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,583
[AIKA]
"Hey everyone,

194
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,791
I wanted to tell you something.

195
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,916
There's a reason why
I've avoided all of you

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,083
and been standoffish until now.

197
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,416
As some of you know,

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,250
I have a tendency to blurt
whatever's on my mind,

199
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,583
even if it's rude.

200
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,916
Because of that, I've hurt
my friends in the past

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,875
without even meaning to.

202
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,125
I was worried that history
would repeat itself.

203
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,875
That I'd make the
same mistakes again.

204
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,166
So I just avoided
talking to anyone.

205
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
I thought that would
stop me from hurting people,

206
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,500
but I was wrong.

207
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,666
The truth is...

208
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,833
I've wanted to be
friends with all of you

209
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,000
from the beginning.

210
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,750
I'm sorry for shutting you out,

211
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,541
but I'm excited to finally
start getting to know you.

212
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,250
Aika Tenkubashi."

213
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,083
[AIKA] I think this
draft is much better!

214
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,458
[REIKO]
Yes, it is better.

215
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,625
However, it's still too long.

216
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,125
[AIKA]
What?

217
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,500
[REIKO] You're trying far
too hard to solve a problem

218
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,750
you've already solved.

219
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,291
How so?

220
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,375
You're already friends
with the girls you're texting,

221
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,625
so you don't really
have to convince them.

222
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,791
That's true.

223
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,375
Screw it, I'm hittin' send!

224
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,083
[AIKA]
Uh...

225
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,708
Is something wrong?

226
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,166
What? No!

227
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,875
[phone beeps]

228
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,000
Glad that's done.

229
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,458
[AIKA]
Thanks for all the help, Reiko.

230
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,208
I'm still new to this stuff.

231
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,750
Don't know what I
would've done without you.

232
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,000
It sure is fun
having lots of friends!

233
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,458
[REIKO]
Yes. Isn't it grand?

234
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,916
[KUJO]
Are you awake, Kimito?

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,708
[KIMITO]
Yeah.

236
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,416
How unfortunate. I was
hoping that you'd sleep forever.

237
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,083
Seriously?!

238
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,875
[KIMITO] Even on field trips,
she's the same as always.

239
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,708
She must really hate me.

240
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,000
Although, crappy wake-up
calls aside,

241
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,583
she's a pretty solid maid.

242
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,833
Of course I am.

243
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
I'm a professional and
I take pride in my work.

244
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,583
What are you,
some kind of psychic witch?

245
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,791
The Commoner's psyche is quite
simplistic in its composition.

246
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,666
This makes it very easy to read.

247
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,125
I'm pretty sure
that was an insult,

248
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,291
and I do not approve!

249
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,833
I don't work for approval.

250
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,708
[KIMITO]
Yep, she's totally the worst.

251
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,958
Aika!

252
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,750
Would you like to have
breakfast with us today?

253
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,500
Please, come with us.

254
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,541
Sure.

255
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,500
[KIMITO yawning]

256
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,000
[STUDENT 4C]
Oh, Aika!

257
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,750
When we get home, we should
throw a tea party together!

258
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,666
[STUDENT 4I]
That sounds fun!

259
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,833
[TWIN 6A]
Can I come?

260
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,041
Yeah! Of course!

261
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,791
Little Aika's
spreadin' her wings.

262
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,041
[REIKO]
Yes. She's come quite far.

263
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,708
Come on. Let us go find
a place to sit and talk.

264
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,833
[KIMITO]
Yeah.

265
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,083
[AIKA laughs]

266
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,708
--That is incredible!
--Pretty awesome, huh?

267
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,416
[KIMITO]
Yo.

268
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,583
Kimito!

269
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,625
Way to go!

270
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,250
With making
more friends, I mean.

271
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,166
Thanks. I'm glad
I got up the nerve!

272
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,333
[KIMITO]
Well, you also worked hard.

273
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,750
Now that I've
put myself out there,

274
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,166
it doesn't seem hard at all.

275
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,208
[KIMITO]
If you say so.

276
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,416
[AIKA laughs]

277
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,583
Well, the truth is...

278
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,958
it's all because of you.

279
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,625
Thanks a lot.

280
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,708
So, guess this is the
end of the Commoner Club.

281
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,583
Say what?

282
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,083
It served its purpose, right?

283
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,708
You made the club
so you could get popular

284
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,500
and your plan worked perfectly.

285
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,291
It's not like
you'll have time for it.

286
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,416
From here on out, you'll spend
your afterschool hours

287
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,833
at fancy tea parties
with your new friends.

288
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,625
Aika. You are dismissed.

289
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,541
[KIMITO]
Well, this is me.

290
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,875
[KIMITO]
Bye!

291
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,291
[KIMITO] Free at last.
This feels awesome.

292
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,500
I can't even remember the last
time I had a bath like this.

293
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,583
[KIMITO]
Eh...?

294
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,750
Uh... Kimito!

295
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,000
[AIKA yells]

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,958
Whoa! Aika!

297
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,583
You're here? But why?

298
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,291
I could ask you the same thing!

299
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,041
The girls had
their time yesterday!

300
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,083
[AIKA] Yeah, well, it felt
so good me and a few others

301
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,416
decided to come again!

302
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,583
[KIMITO]
Others?

303
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,833
So sorry to keep
you waiting, Aika.

304
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,416
But we're here now!

305
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,166
Yeah. I see that.

306
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,500
[STUDENT 4C]
Wow!

307
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,750
The morning view is
absolutely spectacular.

308
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,500
[STUDENT 7B]
I bet the water's perfect.

309
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,000
Well then, let's stop
talking and get right in.

310
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,416
[STUDENTS sigh]

311
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,458
[KIMITO] I dove under so fast
I didn't get a good breath!

312
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,625
[AIKA screams]

313
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,791
[STUDENT 7B]
My dear! Is something wrong?

314
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,166
What? No, no!

315
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,333
It just feels so good.

316
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,791
[STUDENT 4C]
Oh, you're so silly.

317
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,458
[AIKA laughs nervously]

318
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,500
[KIMITO]
I felt her cheeks against mine.

319
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,291
I didn't mean it to
happen that way, but...

320
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,875
I have to admit, it felt nice.

321
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,375
Her butt's small yet mighty,
like a carpenter ant.

322
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,333
Wait, what?

323
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,833
No... This is Aika!

324
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,166
She is not sexy!

325
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,416
[STUDENT 1A]
Is everything all right?

326
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,375
Your face looks awfully
flushed at the moment.

327
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,333
[AIKA gasps]

328
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,708
I'm fine, but Kimito--

329
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,250
[KIMITO]
That was close!

330
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,708
Aika and that big mouth of hers!

331
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,583
If she thinks it,
it'll come right out!

332
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,333
Sorry...

333
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,625
Maybe I'm wrong,

334
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,958
but your hand seems
unusually beefy and manly.

335
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,666
It also came from an
anatomically impossible angle.

336
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,500
[AIKA laughs nervously]

337
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,916
Must be our imaginations.

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,875
The steam's
playing tricks on us.

339
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,666
[AIKA sighs]

340
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,708
Oh yes.

341
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,125
I forgot to ask,
what's Kimito doing?

342
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,000
Uh... The better
question is... Who cares?

343
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,750
Oh and while
we're on the subject,

344
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,250
it seems the two of you have
become quite close lately.

345
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,708
[AIKA]
Yeah? You think so?

346
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,125
[STUDENT 7B]
I am so envious.

347
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,041
Yes. He's so interesting.

348
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,375
Tell the truth.
Are you friends,

349
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,166
or has it grown
into something more?

350
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,458
Oh... There's nothing
to tell, really.

351
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,625
Come now!

352
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,375
You two are always together,
aren't you?

353
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,208
I mean, we hang out every day.

354
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,041
But that may not be
the case for much longer.

355
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,083
So...

356
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,291
What's the matter?

357
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,041
Why are you so upset?

358
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh... I'm fine.
It's no big deal.

359
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,916
[KIMITO] If I don't breathe
soon, I'm a dead man.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,625
What am I gonna do?

361
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,666
If something's bothering you,
you can tell me.

362
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,791
Aika, my goodness!

363
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,208
[AIKA]
Huh?

364
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,833
[STUDENT 1A] Are you grabbing
my derriere right now?

365
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,750
Well... It's nice...

366
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,875
But I'm afraid I'm
not that type of lady.

367
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,958
[AIKA]
Oh. Are you not?

368
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,083
[KIMITO]
Goodbye cruel world.

369
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,291
Farewell, supple rump. I die.

370
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,291
[AIKA]
Had fun!

371
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,833
I'll be out in a minute or two!

372
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,083
All right, but when you're done,

373
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,125
come find us, because we
have lots to talk about.

374
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,500
[AIKA]
Kimito! Kimito!

375
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,541
[AIKA]
Crap, this is really bad!

376
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,708
I have to resuscitate him!

377
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,375
[gasps]
That means mouth to mouth!

378
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,208
If this is a prank,
I'll drown you for real!

379
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,625
This isn't gonna count
as my first kiss, is it?

380
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,416
I mean as long as I put my lips
around his, they won't touch.

381
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,750
[AIKA]
Focus!

382
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,083
[STUDENT 7B]
Aika, are you coming?

383
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,000
I thought you were just
going to be a minute!

384
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,583
It's not what
it looks like, girls.

385
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,000
Kimito's lips are soft
and feel really great!

386
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,250
[KUJO]
Are you awake, Kimito?

387
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,166
[KIMITO]
Uh... Yeah.

388
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,916
When I say I wish
you'd never woken up,

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
I'm not joking.

390
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,500
[KIMITO]
I believe you.

391
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,208
Did I stay in the water too long
and pass out or something?

392
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,833
[KUJO] There's an assembly
at ten o'clock in the lobby.

393
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,000
If I were you, I would
hurry up and get ready.

394
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,000
Otherwise, you are
going to be tardy.

395

[chattering continues]

397
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,708
No! Pull yourself together!

398
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,916
[KIMITO]
Hey, Aika.

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So um... What's goin' on?

400
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,916
[AIKA]
Nothing, why?

[STUDENTS chattering]

403
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,666
[STUDENT 7C] I simply
can't take this anymore!

404
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,708
[STUDENT 7D] This is happening
far too quickly for us.

405
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,416
[STUDENT 7E] Ladies,
let's all move outside.

406
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,000
[KIMITO] Why the heck is
everybody acting so weird?

407
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,416
Oh, I don't know.

408
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,541
Could be because everyone
thinks we're a couple.

409
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
Wait... You and me?

410
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,083
[KAREN]
Kagurazaka.

411
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,375
You're a liar.

412
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,416
[KIMITO]
Uh...

413
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,625
I despise you, Kimito!

414
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,375
You'll pay for this one day,
you womanizer!

415
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:36,000
[REIKO]
My! That's quite a story, Aika.

416
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,833
[REIKO]
So then... You...

417
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,625
You two haven't kissed, then.
Just to make sure I understand.

418
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,041
Kissed? No way. That's gross.

419
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,708
[REIKO sighs]

420
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,083
[REIKO]
In that case,

421
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,458
it's imperative you clear up
this misunderstanding

422
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,958
right away.

423
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,750
If you'd like, I could help
smooth things over for you.

424
00:18:54,291 --> 00:19:04,250
There's no better time
than the present, as they say.

425
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:12,833
There's no better time
than the present, as they say.

426
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,250
Hold on!
Don't send that just yet.

427
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,458
If you'd rather
we wait, then so be it.

428
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,666
Thanks a lot.

429
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,708
You're welcome.

430
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,208
But in exchange for
my agreeing to this,

431
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,583
you have to promise
to room with me

432
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,416
the next time
we go on a field trip.

433
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
I don't understand.

434
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,541
Why do you look
so pleased right now?

435
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,666
Well, I wouldn't go so far
as to say I'm pleased, exactly.

436
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
You really do
despise me, don't you?

437
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,208
Well just so you know,
the feeling's mutual.

438
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,958
No, I don't despise you at all!

439
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,083
When you helped me yesterday,

440
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,000
I almost started
thinking you were nice!

441
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,416
Clearly that was wrong!

442
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,333
You're a good for nothing
sock-muncher!

443
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,166
As are you, Aika!

444
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,041

445

[TOMOKO]
Good morning to you.

446
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,125
[KUJO]
Good morning to you.

447
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,916
Miss, please wait a moment.

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,291
Is everything all right?

449
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,458
You dropped your towel.

450
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,750
[TOMOKO]
Oh. Thank you very much.

451
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,166
[KUJO]
My pleasure, and if you would,

452
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,166
please allow me to
wash this one for you.

453
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,958
I happen to have
a clean one handy.

454
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,958
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss.

455
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,500
Yes. Of course.

456
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,625
Just one question.

457
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,958
Why would someone
from the Kujo family

458
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,500
be working as a servant?

459
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,166
Miyuki, you're a Kujo.

460
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,166
And not just that, you're the
daughter of the family head.

461
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,375
[KUJO]
Forgive me, Miss,

462
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,083
but I'm afraid that
is none of your concern.

463
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,250
Yes, of course.

464
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,000
I was just a bit curious,
that's all.

465
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,333
[KUJO]
Please excuse me.

466
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,541
[KUJO]
Kimito, are you awake?

467
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,500
[KIMITO]
Uh... Yeah.

468
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,291
You have no idea
how badly I wish

469
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,791
you wouldn't have woken up.

470
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,250
And just in case you
all forgot, my score was 80!

471
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,791
This is the greatest
day of my entire life!

472
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,458
[KAREN]
I told you not to move!

473
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,875
Excessive mechanization
is the bane of the worker.

474
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,958
[KIMITO] What's the deal,
do you really hate me that much?
