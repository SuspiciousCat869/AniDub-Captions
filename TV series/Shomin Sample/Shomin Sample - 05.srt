[YAMADA]
Hey!

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,333
Good morning everyone,

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,791
this is Misaki Yamada coming
at you live from the studio!

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,291
I'm here today
with up-and-coming

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,000
teen idol and voice actress,
the one and only Eri Hanae.

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:19,875
Hello there.

7
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,375
Thanks for having me on!

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,000
[YAMADA] This is the third time
we've had you on the show!

9
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,250
In my opinion,

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,666
that pretty much makes
you an honorary host!

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,166
Well in that case.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,500
I'd like our listeners to pick
me out a custom greeting!

13
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,916
Send them in
right away, folks!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,708
Nothing would make me happier!

15
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,916
[ERI]
Damn it!

16
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,333
Stupid DJ!

17
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,125
She didn't talk about my voice,
aka "The Money-Maker."

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,750
She didn't even comment on
how freaking adorable I am,

19
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,000
even though everyone knows it!

20
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,125
I hate her!

21
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,333
How annoying!
How aggravating!

22
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't think I've ever
been this pissed off

23
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,958
in my entire life!

24
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,125
[KIMITO]
Dear Eri. I'm doing fine.

25
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,541
I've managed to make
a few friends here,

26
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,541
so don't worry about me. Kimito.

27
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,625
[ERI] I'm not worried
about you, moron!

28
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,375
What the crap?

29
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,708
[KIMITO]
You came by to see me?

30
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,833
[KIMITO]
First, put some clothes on.

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,208
[stomach growls]

32
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,416
Not much variety here.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,750
What sounds good to you?

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,291
Fried potatoes, steamed
potatoes, or potato cakes?

35
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,125
Potato cakes?

36
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,541
[KIMITO] Well, they're a lot
like rice cakes, I guess.

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,250
You make the dough
out of mashed potatoes,

38
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,833
then fry them in a pan.

39
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,000
They're pretty tasty.

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,416
I want that.

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,750
I don't mind cooking,
but are you sure you want me to?

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,000
I doubt these babies
are on your meal plan.

43
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,833
[HAKUA] As long as you're
the one who prepares it,

44
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,250
I'll eat anything.

45
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,541
[KIMITO]
Right.

46
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,125
Well then, I'll make sure
it tastes delicious.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
[HAKUA]
Kimito?

48
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah?

49
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,583
I would like to help.

50
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,291
[KIMITO] You can ball up
the dough if you want.

51
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,000
[KIMITO] Hang on! Not until
you wash your hands!

52
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,958
[KIMITO]
I have an idea.

53
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,250
[KIMITO]
Whaddaya think? Cute, huh?

54
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, it is cute.

55
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,125
[KIMITO]
Okay!

56
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,416
[KIMITO]
She is one weird girl.

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,666
[KIMITO]
Aw man!

58
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,958
Wait! Why did you only
leave the apron on?

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,708
Why not your freaking panties?

60
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,750
Jeez!

61
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,500
[KIMITO]
Yeah, I don't think weird

62
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,541
is a strong enough word
to describe her.

63
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
[KIMITO]
All right! You ready to eat?

64
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,833
Is it good?

65
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:11,916
Very.

66
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,625
Yeah. It's not bad.

67
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,833
Not bad.

68
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
Here is the question:

69
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,791
What is always closed when
something passes through it,

70
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,583
but always open
when nothing does?

71
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,083
Oh. A riddle. Cool.

72
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,541
It says right down here
that the answer

73
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,708
is a train crossing.

74
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,125
That does make sense.

75
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,958
Don't I get a chance
to guess the answer?

76
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,375
Guess the answer?

77
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,541
What do you mean?

78
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,625
Well, you've played
riddle games before,

79
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,958
haven't you?

80
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,750
Like in kindergarten or
grade school or whatever?

81
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,250
I don't remember very
much from kindergarten.

82
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,458
You have to remember
something, right?

83
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,708
What did you do for fun?

84
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,125
I proved several
ergodic hypotheses.

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,333
Huh?

86
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,500
I created an autonomous robot.

87
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,000
And I drew quite a few
circuit schematics.

88
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,916
Oh. Gotcha.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,125
Well in that case this
should be pretty easy.

90
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,375
Here's a good one.

91
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,791
A father frog obviously
croaks "erbit-erbit."

92
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,083
A mother frog clearly
croaks "ribbit-ribbit."

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,208
So then...

94
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,208
How does their baby frog croak?

95
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,458
"Erbit?" "Ribbit?"

96
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,708
If the vocal sac expands fully.

97
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,333
Depending on the
frog's species...

98
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,708
One twenty four point five!

99
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,083
[KIMITO]
Where'd she get that?

100
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,291
The correct answer is,

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,708
"it doesn't croak,
because it's a tadpole"!

102
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,041
[KIMITO laughing]

103
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,250
Not sure why,

104
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,750
but I thought you'd
be way better at these.

105
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,125
Ask me another one.

106
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,375
'Kay.

107
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,875
When a car drives
around a curve,

108
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,458
what's the one thing
it is guaranteed to lose?

109
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,458
Gasoline?

110
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,333
Gas might burn,
but it's not lost.

111
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,333
Parts?

112
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,625
That would be scary.

113
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,291
People?

114
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,541
I would hope not.

115
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,833
All right,
I'm just gonna tell you--

116
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,083
Not yet!

117
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,333
[HAKUA gasps]

118
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,041
[KIMITO]
Ya figure it out?

119
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,375
[HAKUA] Is it worn-down
tire molecules?

120
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,833
[KIMITO]
Yeah...

121
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,916
But those come off when the
car's going straight, too.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,166
[HAKUA]
Huh?!

123
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,416
[KIMITO] The word you're
lookin' for is "speed."

124
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,416
[KIMITO laughs]

125
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,375
Yeah, ya might be
overthinking your answers a bit.

126
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,625
Give me another!

127
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,875
[KIMITO]
Sorry. I'm all out.

128
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,416
--[HAKUA] One more! One more!
--[KIMITO laughing]

129
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,166
[KIMITO] Go on, Hakua.
Sakimori's waiting.

130
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,458
I wanna stay with Kimito.

131
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,333
[KIMITO]
Don't worry.

132
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,000
You can come by
again tomorrow.

133
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,041
[KIMITO]
Is that a... plushy?

134
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,541
[KIMITO]
Uhh...

135
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,666
[KIMITO gasps]

136
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,000
[KIMITO]
Huh?

137
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,083
[KIMITO]
What was that all about?

138
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,625
[REIKO] Kimito and Hakua
seem to be getting along.

139
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,875
They spend quite
a bit of time together.

140
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,916
[KAREN] Why don't you say
what you really mean?

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,708
What those two
are doing is criminal!

142
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,833
Aika, you know Kimito
as well as anyone,

143
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,333
what are your thoughts
on the matter?

144
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,416
Oh yeah, those two
are totally out-of-bounds!

145
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
It's always bothered me,
but lately,

146
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,750
it's getting
borderline freakish!

147
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,500
If I so much as open
my mouth to talk to Kimito,

148
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,250
she gets all weird
and clingy with him

149
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,500
and he falls
right into her trap.

150
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,375
[KAREN] I wish she would
cling to me instead.

151
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,416
[AIKA] Sometimes, when we're
playing video games together,

152
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,208
Hakua decides Kimito's not
paying enough attention to her.

153
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,291
So naturally she starts
takin' all her clothes off,

154
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,833
like some deranged psychopath!

155
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,083
[KAREN] Well, we can't
force her to wear clothes!

156
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,208
I'm tellin' you,
she does it on purpose!

157
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,041
Oh, you don't
have to tell me that!

158
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,250
She only eats cookies
if he feeds them to her.

159
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,458
When he puts them on a plate,
she refuses to so much

160
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,791
as acknowledge them!

161
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,375
I don't know what else to say.

162
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,666
Except this, of course:

163
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,250
It depresses me to
the very core of my being!

164
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:54,875
He sucks!

165
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,041
Yes he does!

166
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,416
[BOTH]
Hm?

167
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
I feel envy.
I want to kill him.

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,333
No. Killing him will not do.

169
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,708
There's no question,
he's the one to blame here.

170
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,333
When he feeds her, he's like
a kid in a candy store.

171
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,500
He's loving every minute of it,
big ole jerk wad that he is!

172
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,833
He's acting like her manservant.
It's disgusting.

173
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,083
Well in that case...

174
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,958
Perhaps I should strip like her.

175
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,750
[AIKA]
Huh?

176
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,541
It was nothing!

177
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,166
Nothing at all, I swear!

178
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,416
The answer is simple.

179
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,583
We must tear sweet Hakua
from his clutches.

180
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,083
If we don't
intervene and fast,

181
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,791
this situation will turn
from bad to worse,

182
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,250
and I will not allow that.

183
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,416
The perv must be stopped!

184
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,791
I agree!

185
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,500
We can't just sit back
and let it go on like this.

186
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,041
You are exactly right, Aika.

187
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,750
We must do everything in our
collective power to stop them!

188
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,708
[REIKO]
But first...

189
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,666
We must discuss the matter
thoroughly with Hakua.

190
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,166
[REIKO]
This is peculiar.

191
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,833
She should be here by now.

192
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,583
Kimito is out running
an errand at the moment.

193
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,833
Unfortunately, he will
not be back for a while.

194
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,791
[REIKO]
Please! Don't leave!

195
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,166
He's gone, but you
can hang with us.

196
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,625
Oh yes.

197
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,833
It can be very fun with just
us girls, don't you agree?

198
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,875
We would very much like to spend
some time with you, Hakua.

199
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,958
Come, come. Take a seat.

200
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,583
Oh! I know what to do!
I will make us some tea!

201
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,291
[AIKA]
Sounds good!

202
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,458
[KAREN]
Yes, indeed!

203
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,916
Well? Is something
the matter, Hakua?

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,625
Please. Do have some.

205
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,541
What's her problem?

206
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,083
My tea is perfect, as are
the tasty treats I prepared.

207
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,000
Maybe she doesn't like
the way that it smells?

208
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,833
No, it's something else.

209
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,666
What could it possibly be?

210
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
[KAREN]
Hakua only eats

211
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,208
when someone feeds her
by hand, remember?

212
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,166
Eat the treat!

213
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,125
[AIKA] I don't think
that's gonna work.

214
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,958
You leave me
with no other choice!

215
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,291
Hi, I'm Kimito.
I like muscle men 

216
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,041
and girls who look like
they're in grade school

217
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,458
'cause I'm a perv!

218
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh hey, look.

219
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,708
A cookie in my hand.
Wanna eat it?

220
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,000
[KAREN]
She despises me!

221
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,500
[stomach growling]

222
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,666
[REIKO]
I'm confused.

223
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,458
What do we do, Aika?

224
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,208
How the heck
am I supposed to know?

225
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,916
Kiryu? Kiryu?

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,833
[KIRYU]
Yes, Miss Reiko.

227
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:36,875
I'm here.

228
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank goodness.

229
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,041
Look at this, Hakua.

230
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,291
I brought you some sushi,
it's on your scheduled menu.

231
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,250
[REIKO]
I guess it's true.

232
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,583
If it's not part of her menu,
then she refuses to eat it.

233
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,083
[AIKA]
She's a weird one.

234
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,500
But now that
we got her eating,

235
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,958
I think we should have our talk!

236
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,750
[REIKO]
Yes. I concur.

237
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,583
[AIKA]
Say, Hakua!

238
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,708
[ALL gasp]

239
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,791
[AIKA]
Whoa! Stop that!

240
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
Hakua, please, you must
not undress yourself right now!

241
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,583
[KAREN]
Gah! She's so adorable!

242
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,000
Pointless! It's so pointless!

243
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,458
How can she be so cute?

244
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,958
Can you not? You freak.

245
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,375
What's wrong, Aika?

246
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,625
[AIKA]
Are you okay?

247
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,708
Don't just lie there!
Get her panties back on!

248
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,916
Stop it with
the strip routine!

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,958
[KAREN]
Pointless! Pointless!

250
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,000
[AIKA]
Karen, shut up!

251
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,708
[AIKA panting]

252
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,291
[REIKO]
This is quite tiresome.

253
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,666
Does Kimito go
through this every day?

254
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,583
[AIKA sighs]
He doesn't have to.

255
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,291
She's a heck of a lot
easier to handle

256
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,041
when he's the one
taking care of her.

257
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,375
Oh, dear.

258
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
So you're suggesting Hakua
has closed her heart off

259
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,041
to us completely?

260
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:45,833
Maybe.

261
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[knocking]

262
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,291
Pardon, ladies.

263
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,208
Miss Hakua, I've come
to take you back home.

264
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,125
[REIKO]
Hakua. Wake up.

265
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,625
Your maid is here to get you.

266
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,958
I can handle things
from here. Thanks!

267
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,916
Gather up your things, please.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,791
Oh! I see Kimito
is not here today.

269
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,125
How odd.

270
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,083
No, just my other friends.

271
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,833
[SAKIMORI]
All right. Off we go.

272
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,083
[HAKUA]
As I'm sure you all know,

273
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,625
a father frog obviously
croaks "erbit-erbit."

274
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,125
And given that,

275
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,291
a mother frog must clearly
croak "ribbit-ribbit." Right?

276
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,583
But if that's true,
how does a baby frog croak?

277
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,958
I adore a good riddle.

278
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,291
The father frog goes "erbit."

279
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,708
And the mother frog
goes "ribbit."

280
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,041
Then the baby frog goes...

281
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,500
The baby frog goes...

282
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,166
She's so cute! It's pointless!

283
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,708
What? That's a trick question.

284
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,708
A baby frog's a tadpole,
so it doesn't croak at all.

285
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,000
Well... Hello. Uh...

286
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:47,750
Long time no--

287
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,625
You jerk.

288
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,458
I don't even know you anymore.

289
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,416
You leave your girlfriend
all alone for over a month?

290
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,875
I suppose you must've
been very busy.

291

[KIMITO]
Yeah. Sorry. My bad.

[MARIKA (ERI)]
Moron.

293
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,000
I was terribly
worried about you.

294
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,375
I was starting to think
you didn't like me anymore.

295
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,416
[KIMITO] Would I feel less
creepy playing this game

296
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,208
if it wasn't voiced by Eri?

297
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,375
Probably not.

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,416
Eri, one of my
friends from home,

322
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,791
is the lead voice actress.

323
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,916
Wait, what?

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,041
When you play video games,

325
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,958
the characters talk
and stuff, right?

326
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,416
She does the voices.

327
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,541
Cool! I wanna hear
what she sounds like!

328
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,291
Sure thing, knock yourself out.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,875
I'm Marika.

330
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,083
Nice to meet you!

331
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,791
[AIKA]
Uh--Oh!

332
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,583
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Aika Tenkubashi.

333
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,625
So, you're good
friends with Kimito, are you?

334
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,125
Uh, yeah?

335
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,750
I mean, I guess
you could say that.

336
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,541
[MARIKA (ERI) chuckles]

337
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,041
No need to be nervous.

338
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,458
Oh. Right.

339
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,541
Well, if I'm being honest,

340
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,208
I'm a little bit
nervous myself.

341
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,750
That makes us twinsies.

342
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,916
[AIKA chuckling]

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
[KIMITO] You know
she's not real, right?

344
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,416
[P.A. VOICE 5A]
Mr. Kimito Kagurazaka.

345
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,666
Please come to the president's
office immediately.

346
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,875
[KIMITO]
What the heck?

347
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,125
I'll be back in a bit.

348
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,416
I like spending
time with you, Aika.

349
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,416
You seem like a
really awesome person.

350
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,250
You too!

351
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,666
You're super awesome!

352
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,166
Glad you agree.

353
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,458
I know we just met, but I
think we can be best friends!

354
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,875
Yes! Same here!

355
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,875
I'll love you
till death do us part!

356
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,125
Would you mind saying that
one more time please?

357
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,541
I'll love you
till death do us part!

358
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,458
Hello, Kimito,
how are you today?

359
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,333
[AIKA giggling]

360
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,666
Aika? What are you doing here?

361
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,791
Huh? Oh. Nothin' much.

362
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,791
Just makin' a new bestie.

363
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,583
Oh. Neat.

364
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,958
Look. If it's Kimito
you want, he's not here.

365
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,333
Hakua and Karen aren't either,
and I'm busy.

366
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,416
So don't let the door
hit your butt on the way out.

367
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
[REIKO] His room feels
far more spacious

368
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,791
with just the two of us inside.

369
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,291
Isn't your room spacious too?

370
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,708
There's a book I'd
like to borrow, that is all.

371
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,833
[AIKA sighs]

372
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,250
[AIKA] Doesn't look like
the silent treatment's

373
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,875
gonna work on this girl.

374
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,708
Maybe if I pretend
to have an infectious di--

375
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,791
I have a question.

376
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,166
Huh. Good for you.

377
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,083
I'm curious about these books.

378
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,875
Why do all the covers
feature girls?

379
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,208
[AIKA]
Well, if ya look closely,

380
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,666
you'll see that the girls
on the manga's covers

381
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,208
are also its main characters.

382
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,458
[REIKO]
Yes, that's true,

383
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,791
but all the other series
are the exact same way.

384
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,375
These novels are directed
at gentlemen, are they not?

385
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,708
Don't you find it strange?

386
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,291
Maybe I would if I cared.

387
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,333
Just borrow a book
and read it in your room.

388
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,208
Later, I'll tell Kimito
you stole it.

389
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,958
First I'd like to
ask you something else.

390
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,458
Why are you reading in his room?

391
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,291
Also, I find it unsavory
that you're on his bed.

392
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,000
Certainly there are more
appropriate places to read.

393
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
Mind your own business.

394
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,458
[REIKO gasps]
My goodness! Aika!

395
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,958
I can see your underpants!

396
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,916
[AIKA]
Pervert!

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,416
If anybody here
is a pervert, it's you!

398
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,166
You are far too relaxed in
Kimito's residence, young lady!

399
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm goin' back to my room.

400
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,875
Are ya happy now, jerk?

401
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,541
Yes, extremely happy.

402
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,125
Now, when he returns,

403
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,500
the two of us will finally get
to spend some time by ourselves.

404
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,000
Ooh, which one is that?

405
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,500
Hey get away!

406
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,708
[REIKO] Once again, a book
with girls on the cover flap.

407
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,791
It appears to me that nearly all
of Kimito's books are like this.

408
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,916
Why is that?

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,458
[AIKA]
Uh... 'Cause he's a pervert?

410
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,416
How dare you!
Kimito is a gentlemen!

411
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,833
Why, surely you don't believe
him to be anything less?

412
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,083
[AIKA] Maybe he's
a perverted gentleman.

413
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,958
Well... One thing seems clear.

414
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,166
Even though he's purported
to be homosexual,

415
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,333
Kimito is obviously
interested in women.

416
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
[REIKO giggles]
What shall I do?

417
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,250
[AIKA] The heck do you mean,
"what shall I do?"

418
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
[REIKO] I must admit,
I have truly come to adore

419
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,416
one of the characters who
appears in this story.

420
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
She speaks and acts
in an unusual way.

421
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,708
But I simply love
her earnest demeanor.

422
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,041
And how hard she works

423
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,000
so as not to let the
recipients of her good will

424
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,416
feel indebted to her.

425
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,916
[AIKA] Meh. I prefer
the main character.

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,583
[REIKO]
Huh? Who do you mean?

427
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,958
[AIKA]
The main one! Her!

428
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,833
[REIKO]
Oh. Is that who you meant?

429
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,375
Forgive me, but she did not
leave much of an impression.

430
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,583
[AIKA]
How could she not?

431
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,791
She's a frickin' angel!

432
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,625
I mean look! She has wings!

433
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,708
I'm gonna go find
some comfort food.

434
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
What do you suppose that is?

435
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
Uh, you gonna
follow me everywhere, or?

436
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,500
It appears to be
some kind of juice.

437
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,000
This must be the type
of thing a Commoner drinks.

438
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,416
Well, it's mine now!

439
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,750
That is not fair, Aika.

440
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,958
I would like to drink
some of the juice as well!

441
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,250
What's your problem?

442
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,083
I'm the one who found it!
It's mine by right!

443
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,958
Look, Blondie.
I'm not a stingy girl.

444
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,416
But you're the last person
I'd share this drink with!

445
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,500
If that's how it must be.

446
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,791
What?

447
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,208
There's only one bottle,

448
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,458
so it doesn't appear that
sharing's a viable option.

449
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,041
Hey. Wait a sec.

450
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,166
Fine. Grab some cups.

451
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,208
Go ahead.

452
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,916
I'm gonna let you have some.

453
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,041
Because it's the
right thing to do.

454
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,000
[AIKA]
You're a weirdo.

455
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,791
Why are you so giddy
all of a sudden?

456
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,708
Oh. Well, I suppose
I'm a bit excited, is all.

457
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,333
It's not every day
I get the opportunity

458
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,291
to drink the Commoner juice.

459
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,250
Oh, yeah?

460
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,750
Let's give it a try then.

461
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,916
[AIKA]
Bottoms up!

462
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,625
[REIKO] Aika, I drink this
to your health!

463
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,833
[AIKA]
What is this crap?!

464
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,041
[BOTH coughing]

465
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,000
[REIKO] That bubbling
was absolutely horrendous!

466
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,166
[AIKA]
Aww, man...

467
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,041
Why the heck did you
spit it all over me?

468
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:11,875
So gross!

469
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,625
[REIKO]
You did the same!

470
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,916
[AIKA]
Ugh! This is just hopeless!

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,791
[REIKO]
Wait!

472
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,958
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,291
I'm gonna get
all sticky if I don't take

474
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,916
these nasty clothes off.

475
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,625
Why are you staring
at me like that?

476
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,250
No reason.

477
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,541
[REIKO] You can't just heap
your clothes on the floor!

478
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,500
[AIKA]
It's fine!

479
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,000
No ma'am, it is not.

480
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,916
As a student of Seikain, I
cannot abide this lack of form.

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,041
We have standards.

482
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:40,958
[AIKA]
Leave me alone!

483
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,750
Give them here!

484
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,166
[BOTH yell]

485
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,333
[REIKO]
Aika, can you hear me?

486
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,291
Aika, please.
You have to wake up!

487
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,208
Are you all right? Speak to me!

488
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,708
[muffled screaming]

489
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,250
I was so worried about you!

490
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,458
My apologies, Aika.

491
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,333
I do hope you will forgive me.

492
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,958
It was an accident, I swear.

493
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,708
Whatever, just get your
filthy jug-a-lugs outta my face!

494
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,125
What? Jug-a-lugs?

495
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,583
Are you making disparaging
comments about my breasts?

496
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,166
[AIKA] Oh, should I
have called them udders?

497
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,916
[REIKO] If I were you,
I'd take that back!

498
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,750
[AIKA]
No way!

499
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,541
Just get off of me, already!

500
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,916
They're filthy, you say?

501
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,125
Tell me, what exactly do you
find filthy about these?

502
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,875
I wash them with soap
nearly twice a day!

503
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,583
[AIKA screams]

504
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,750
--[AIKA] Get 'em outta my face!
--[REIKO] No! I shall not!

505
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,791
[REIKO] I shall not budge
till you take it back!

506
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,458
Apologize!

507
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,208
[KIMITO]
Uh...

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,458
[KIMITO]
Sorry to interrupt!

509
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,166
No, wait,
you've got the wrong idea!

510
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,041
Kimito!
This isn't what it looks like!

511
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,833
[ERI]
Damn it, Kimito.

512
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,916
Where did you go?
And what are you up to?

513
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,083
You see, this is "self" service.

514
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,375
I just want the toy.

515
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,541
One large chocolate
cream Foamuccino, please!

516
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,250
Meet me outside!

517
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,333
I will order first!

518
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,125
[SAKIMORI]
What are you doing, Hakua?

519
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,666
[AIKA screaming]

520
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,916
[KUJO]
It's called "Shominland."
