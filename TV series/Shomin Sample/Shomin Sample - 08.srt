[AIKA]
Hey, Kimito!

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,791
How do Commoners
get their fortunes told?

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,083
Our phones.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,041
We use fortune telling apps
and websites, too.

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,083
You're totally blowing
my mind right now!

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,583
Okay, show me!

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,125
Yeah. Sure.

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,000
[MOON (ERI)]
You don't need the cosmos.

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,333
You've got me!

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,208
Hey, that sounds
like your friend.

11
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,583
Yup. This was
one of her first jobs.

12
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,750
Cool.

13
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,000
Get ready, because
here comes your fortune!

14
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,166
Sweet Aika...

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,625
The walls around your
brain are too thin

16
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,291
to keep in your thoughts!
That's why you're so blunt!

17
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,375
You blurt out your thoughts

18
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,500
'cause there's nothing
to stop them!

19
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,791
It's the reason you
keep people at arm's length!

20
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,208
Wow! That's so me!
This is incredible!

21
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,583
All I did was
put in my birthday,

22
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,750
and she summed up my
personality perfectly!

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,583
All in the blink of an eye!

24
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,541
This is the greatest
invention of all time!

25
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,833
Look. It has your lucky
color written down as well.

26
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,083
Let me see!

27
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,125
Well?

28
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,250
What is that?

29
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,500
The app says green
is my lucky color!

30
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,583
So if I cover myself with it,
then, for the rest of my life,

31
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,166
I'll always have good luck!

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,250
Brilliant plan.

33
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,041
But you missed a spot.
Your face.

34
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,291
[AIKA]
Good call.

35
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,541
If I want this to work,
I have to really commit.

36
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,833
[AIKA] Hey, wait.
What about my palms?

37
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,666
Shouldn't I do something
to green them up a bit?

38
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,625
Do it, Aika.

39
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,125
Go green all the way!

40
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,916
[AIKA] How do I look?
Great, or super great?

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,125
[KIMITO]
Mega great!

42
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,666
And while you're holding
those edamame beans,

43
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,333
you should dance around and
shout for all the world to hear.

44
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,583
"Beans, beans!"

45
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,708
[AIKA]
Wait, why?

46
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,333
It's a Commoner
dance we always do

47
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,041
the day before spring starts.

48
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,416
It'll bring you good luck.

49
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,708
[AIKA]
For real?

50
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,041
My dad would scatter
soybeans on Spring's Eve.

51
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,416
Do Commoners do that, too?

52
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Yeah. But we also do the dance,

53
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,916
and even though
it's not Spring's Eve,

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,208
I think you should try it.

55
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,375
You've gone this far.

56
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,375
Might as well take it
to the next level.

57
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,750
Make me proud.

58
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,750
[AIKA] But shouldn't I
be using soybeans for this?

59
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,250
[KIMITO] Edamame beans
are baby soybeans.

60
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,500
[AIKA]
I didn't know that!

61
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,458
Break it down, Aika. Let loose!

62
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,833
Bust a move and get
yourself some good luck!

63
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,375
[AIKA]
Beans, beans! Beans, beans!

64
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,875
Beans, beans! Beans, beans!

65
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,333
[KIMITO]
Attaway, Aika!

66
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,458
[AIKA]
Beans, beans!

67
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,041
[KIMITO]
Do your thing!

68
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,125
[AIKA]
Yeah!

69
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,166
[KIMITO]
Take it from the top!

70
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,000
[AIKA]
Right! Beans, beans!

71
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,083
Beans, beans! Beans, beans!

72
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,125
Yeah!

73
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,208
[REIKO]
This is certainly... peculiar.

74
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,541
Get ready, because
here comes your fortune!

75
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,625
Kind Reiko...

76
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,250
You live for the
daily contact you have

77
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,500
with the many friends
who surround you.

78
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,958
Because of your excellent powers
of observation and analysis,

79
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,791
you will find success
in doing management work.

80
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,500
You are relentless in
your pursuit of romance.

81
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,750
Oh my!

82
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,125
For a digitized gypsy,
she's quite accurate!

83
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,958
Totes! It's like she
can see inside our souls!

84
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:26,958
That it is.

85
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,458
Why don't we let
Hakua try it next?

86
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,250
Darling Hakua...

87
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,125
You're like a
walking contradiction.

88
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,750
So hard to pin down.

89
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,708
Depending on the day,
you're either fully invested

90
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,250
or fiercely apathetic.

91
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,125
You have a scholar's mind,
and an artist's temperament.

92
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,291
She's got you there!

93
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,500
Commoner fortune
telling is beyond belief!

94
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,291
What a lovely civilization!

95
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,500
[KIMITO chuckles]

96
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,458
It's surprising how
accurate this thing is.

97
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,750
I mean, it pretty much
described you perfectly.

98
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,750
[KAREN]
So pointless!

99
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
What could some
fortune telling app

100
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,708
possibly know about me?

101
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,666
I simply will not allow
myself to be caught up

102
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,875
in such childish,
inane frivolities!

103
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,041
Well, if that's really true,

104
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,458
then you won't mind
if I go next.

105
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,708
You're an idiot!

106
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,416
You obviously want to try it.

107
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,791
[KAREN] Only to see
what it knows of my skill!

108
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,791
Go ahead.

109
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,708
If this machine
is truly accurate,

110
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,666
then it will laud
my noble way of life,

111
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,166
and my unparalleled
ability to wield a sword

112
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,416
in the throes of combat.

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,750
Pretty sure you're wrong there.

114
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,458
[phone chiming]

115
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,083
Mighty Karen...
You are extremely lonely.

116
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,666
And your melancholy makes you
act in an aggressive way.

117
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,708
You're a scatterbrained
worrywart who lives your life

118
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,125
in a constant state of panic,
anxiety and distress.

119
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,250
When it comes to romance,
you are passive at best

120
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,125
and completely inept at worst.

121
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,416
This must be some
kind of terrible mistake!

122
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,083
[KIMITO]
Really? Sounds dead on to me.

123
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,708
[KAREN]
Let me see that!

124
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,333
I only got such
an absurd result

125
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,916
because you were
the one holding it.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,416
Let's see if things
aren't a little different

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,625
this time around!

128
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,583
[KAREN] Test your romantic
compatibility with friends?

129
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,125
As members of the Commoner Club,

130
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,833
it is our mandate
to explore this.

131
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,458
I, for one, firmly believe that
we should learn all we can

132
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,708
from this app.

133
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,416
As do I.

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,208
A valid point.

135
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,375
[HAKUA]
Yeah.

136
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,583
I'm glad you agree.

137
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,958
Now then,
let's make full use of

138
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,458
this vaunted
fortune telling apparatus.

139
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,625
Sadly, it only
tells compatibility

140
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,041
between the opposite sexes.

141
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
Since Kimito is the only boy,

142
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,458
we'll need to have it evaluate
our compatibility with him.

143
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,500
Normally, more choices
would be ideal.

144
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,666
But as it stands,
he's our only option.

145
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,041
Yeah. Too bad.

146
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,291
We'll just have to make do.

147
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,958
Yes, painful though it may be.

148
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,708
[KIMITO] I've never seen them
agree like this before.

149
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,041
Well, I guess this is
today's club activity.

150
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,166
Should go fine, as long
as it's all in good fun.

151
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,708
Let's get started, then.

152
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,333
Care to go first, Kimito?

153
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,208
Sure. I'm glad to.

154
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,833
But don't you think
everyone's acting weird?

155
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,041
[REIKO]
Weird?

156
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,041
Never mind. It's nothing.

157
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,625
Well, how about we
start things off with you?

158
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,583
Is something wrong?

159
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,125
[REIKO]
Oh, no!

160
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,541
That just wouldn't be fair.

161
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,416
[AIKA gasps]

162
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,208
Let's go alphabetically!

163
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,416
[AIKA, KIMITO]
So then... A for Aika.

164
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
[AIKA]
Sure, I guess.

165
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,083
What's this?

166
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,291
What?

167
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,625
That's cool.
It gives us a numerical score.

168
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,083
[AIKA]
How many points did I get?

169
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,000
Uh... Well...

170
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,458
[KIMITO gasps]

171
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,166
[KIMITO]
Uh... Oh boy.

172
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,291
Spit it out!

173
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,333
[REIKO] Hurry up
and tell us the number!

174
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,416
[KAREN]
Quit stalling!

175
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,250
Uh...

176
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,625
Hakua, did you mean to
punch me in the shin, or...?

177
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,708
Yes.

178
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,291
Okay. Right.

179
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,208
Me and Aika's
compatibility score is--

180
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,833
You got 80 points!

181
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,125
This may take you by surprise,

182
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,750
but the truth is
the two of you would make

183
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,458
quite an extraordinary couple!

184
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,166
A strong romance
is often built upon

185
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,416
the foundation of friendship,

186
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,083
and that is certainly
the case here!

187
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,375
[AIKA]
All right!

188
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,958
[AIKA squealing]

189
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,291
[AIKA giggling, cheering]

190
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,375
So earlier, I got
excited 'cause I thought

191
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,375
my lucky green body suit
was paying off!

192
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,333
But then I realized luck's
got nothin' to do with it

193
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,166
'cause some things
are just meant to be!

194
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,500
And clearly that's
the case with me and Kimito.

195
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,208
Not that I'm into him,
but hey, destiny's spoken.

196
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,541
[REIKO]
I'd like to go next, please.

197
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,458
And I realize that might
appear to be out of order.

198
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,875
But in all reality,
I should've been first anyway,

199
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,291
considering my last name
starts with an A.

200
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,666
Uh huh.

201
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,458
Aww, isn't it sweet how
bad Reiko wants to go next?

202
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,625
Sure hope she gets
what she wants.

203
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,208
However, against a
score as high as mine,

204
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,750
I don't think she has much
of a chance of winning out!

205
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,541
And just in case you all forgot,
my score was 80!

206
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,958
Good luck, Reiko!

207
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,125
[AIKA laughs]

208
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,333
Please tell me
our results, and quickly.

209
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,458
I'm dying to know!

210
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,750
90 points! That's amazing!

211
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,750
You two are perfectly suited
for the bonds of matrimony!

212
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,541
Together, your life
as a married couple

213
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,375
would be long, joyous
and incredibly fruitful.

214
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh my! 90 points indeed!

215
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,625
And she says we're highly
suited for marriage as well!

216
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,041
This is the greatest day
of my entire life!

217
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,041
You're wrong! No!

218
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,333
This has to be a mistake!

219
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,125
Aww... Come now, Aika.

220
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,041
We should be glad that we both
received favorable results.

221
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,958
For my part, I am quite pleased
with my score of 90.

222
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,125
And what was your
score again, Aika?

223
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,291
I don't remember.
Wasn't it lower?

224
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,791
How 'bout you, Hakua? Wanna try?

225
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,708
[KIMITO]
I didn't wanna leave her out,

226
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,916
but this could definitely
get a little awkward.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,666
Here goes.

228
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,125
50 points.

229
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,541
Kimito and Hakua, it seems
the chemistry between you

230
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,833
is neither good nor bad.

231
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,750
Because Hakua hardly ever speaks

232
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,291
and is not much
of a communicator,

233
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,333
you two will have
to work extremely hard

234
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
even to understand one another.

235
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
[KIMITO] Not sure what
I was hopin' for with that.

236
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
All right,
time for damage control.

237
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,333
Oh well, it's just
a silly game, right?

238
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,750
Who wants some tea?

239
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,833
[KIMITO]
Hakua?

240
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Okay, then.

241
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,333
I know what always
makes me feel better

242
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,458
when I'm feeling sad.

243
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,625
Delicious goodies!

244
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,833
Awesome idea!

245
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,750
I'll go get 'em real quick!

246
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,083
[door opens, closes]

247
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,041
[KIMITO] Honestly,
I don't think she's that upset.

248
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,375
Whelp, that leaves
the two of us.

249
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,208
I can't very well be the
only one who doesn't try it.

250
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,250
[KIMITO] Hey. If you don't
want to, it's no big deal.

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,458
But I can tell by the look
on your face, you secretly do.

252
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,750
[KAREN] You know nothing
about what I want, you fiend!

253
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,083
Yeah. Right.

254
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,416
Uh oh!

255
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
If you two were together,
poor Kimito would die!

256
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,583
Die?!

257
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,541
[KAREN growls]
Damn you!

258
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,083
[KIMITO] Why are you
trying to carve me up?

259
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,500
I didn't do anything!

260
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,541
Well, I'm not surprised.

261
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,125
I don't need a
fortuneteller to tell me

262
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,083
that we're romantically
incompatible.

263
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,416
You disgust me.
It's obvious!

264
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Would you please
stop stabbing my carpet

265
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,125
with your katana?

266
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,500
Uh... Oh. Hey.

267
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
It looks like I messed up
your information.

268
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,125
[KAREN]
What?

269
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,041
[KIMITO]
I put in the wrong birthday.

270
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,083
Let me fix it.

271
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,291
A hundred points!

272
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,833
That's a perfect score!

273
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,583
Karen and Kimito,
what you have is fate.

274
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,666
There is simply no other way
to express your love!

275
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,291
As ultimate partners,
you will bond on a deep level,

276
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,041
both spiritually
and emotionally.

277
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,583
Karen, you should
start aggressively

278
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,708
pressing your attack
as early as tomorrow!

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,958
Play up your special skills and
charge him as hard as you can!

280
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,500
A... perfect score?

281
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,375
[KIMITO] Relax.
Don't take it so seriously.

282
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,416
It's just a game.

283
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,416
I'll say!

284
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,708
Clearly it's not
to be relied upon!

285
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,208
[AIKA] You can't put
your faith in that crap!

286
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,708
[REIKO]
Crap, indeed!

287
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,166
[KIMITO] You were both raving
about how accurate it was

288
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,500
like five seconds ago!

289
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,083
[AIKA]
Gimme that!

290
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,333
"No matter what, he will
slowly slip away from you."

291
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,125
Well, if that's not a
big old load of horse crap,

292
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,416
then I don't know what is!

293
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,250
"The two of you have a
strong karmic connection

294
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,666
from a past life."

295
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,041
That sounds lovely. Perhaps it's
not so bad after all.

296
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,916
"Aika sure does have
a whole lot of friends!"

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,458
That's wrong!

298
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,833
Wow!

299
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,791
There are so many fortuneteller
websites out there!

300
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,791
[AIKA]
No kidding!

301
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,791
[REIKO]
I'll find the perfect one!

302
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,541
[AIKA]
Not before me, Blondie!

303
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
Look here, I found another app

304
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,708
and this one says Kimito and I
are meant to be, so that's that!

305
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,041
I also asked about you,

306
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,708
and it says that your
connection with Kimito is

307
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,958
"all in your dumb little head!"

308
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,583
That is simply not possible!

309
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,375
This clearly says that
"Kimito and Reiko

310
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,500
are a match made in heaven

311
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,250
and they will live
happily ever after!"

312
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,708
Your compatibility says,
"Aika is verifiably insane

313
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,541
and Kimito could
never love her."

314
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,375
You lose, crazy.

315
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,166
If anybody here
is insane, it's you!

316
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,958
How dare you
insult me like that, Aika?

317
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,708
[KIMITO] Well...
So much for "all in good fun."

318
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,041
[arguing continues]

319
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,958
That's quite enough, ladies!

320
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,625
Both of you stop
this argument at once.

321
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,541
It's disgraceful
for us to compete

322
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,583
over which of our
fortunes is correct.

323
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,833
Especially when it's crystal
clear that my fortune

324
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,541
is the only one that
contains any validity.

325
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,875
[AIKA, REIKO]
Like hell it does!

326
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,250
You think I'm
gonna take anything

327
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,625
that some hussy in a sailor
outfit says seriously?

328
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,416
Hey...

329
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,750
Uh... You okay?

330
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,458
My blood sugar's low.

331
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,833
Ah... Well...
Should I make ya something?

332
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,500
[HAKUA]
Potato cakes.

333
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,375
Cool. That sounds good to me.

334
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,208
I just hope I have potatoes.

335
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,625
Pancakes would
be all right, too.

336
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,750
[KIMITO]
Sounds great.

337
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,208
D'you wanna be my sous-chef?

338
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,625
[KUJO]
Are you awake, Kimito?

339
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,541
[KIMITO]
Uh... Yeah.

340
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
You have no idea
how badly I wish

341
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,666
you'd never woken up.

342
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,208
[KIMITO]
What am I?

343
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,833
Caught in a freakin' time loop?

344
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,375
Listen.

345
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,625
There's something I've been
meanin' to ask you, actually.

346
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,708
How come you always
watch me sleep?

347
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,208
Every morning when
I wake up, there you are.

348
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,291
Is somethin' the matter?

349
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,333
Is there a rule that says
I'm forced to answer you

350
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,625
or am I permitted to
abstain from doing so?

351
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,500
[KIMITO] If you don't want
to answer me, then don't.

352
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,166
As I've said before,
unfortunately,

353
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,041
I am the maid assigned
to care for you.

354
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,666
And as such, the horrific chore

355
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,333
of waking you up every
single morning falls to me.

356
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,708
If I had my way,
you would stay asleep forever.

357
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,125
But because of my sworn duty,
I have no choice.

358
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,166
I've considered smothering you.
But that would be too merciful.

359
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,041
I'm almost positive I
counted four insults there.

360
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:53,833
You can count?

361
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
[KIMITO]
That makes five!

362
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,041
[KUJO] I find waking you
quite burdensome,

363
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,166
so I allow myself to enjoy
your final moments of sleep.

364
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,541
[KIMITO] Huh...
That was weirdly phrased.

365
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,500
The worst part is
I have to watch you drool.

366
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,458
[KIMITO]
I would say of all the things

367
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,833
that could happen in my sleep,

368
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,083
my drooling should be
the least of your concerns!

369
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,541
Are you having
impure thoughts?

370
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,625
[KIMITO]
What?!

371
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,750
And why are those
scissors so big?!

372
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,541
My point is you don't
have to wake me up anymore.

373
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,625
My smart phone has an alarm,
I'll just use that.

374
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,041
[KUJO]
Is that so?

375
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,458
In that case, I shall destroy
your evil smart phone!

376
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,791
What for?!

377
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,833
Excessive mechanization
is the bane of the worker!

378
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,458
[KIMITO] If you break that,
I'll lose all my contacts!

379
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,375
Since you insist
on forcing my hand,

380
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,791
I'm afraid that you leave me
with no other alternative.

381
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,416
Instead of waking you up gently,

382
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,208
I'll put on skates
and perform a triple axel

383
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,541
on your so-called "manhood."

384
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,500
[KIMITO] That seems a
little extreme doesn't it?

385
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,666
Then, am I to assume we
will continue the same way

386
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,958
we have up to now?

387
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,583
Umm... Yeah, let's.

388
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,875
[KUJO]
I'll excuse myself.

389
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,625
Please get dressed immediately.

00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,541

I've never watched one of
these muscle-men videos before.

What's wrong?

[MOON (ERI)] Karen, you should
start aggressively pressing

as early as tomorrow.

it's amazing, don't you?

Yeah. For sure.

Oh no, how awful.

419

It appears that the sleeve of
your jacket's been cut through.

how that happened.

I can mend that
sleeve in no time.

[KIMITO]
What?

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,333
I don't have any
stitching equipment on hand.

But everything we need's
in my room.

Of course it is.

filled with bunny people.

amiss, or...?

See? The clothes.

00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,083
Yep. Clothes.

464
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,833
[KIMITO] Okay, so clearly I
shouldn't be staring like this

465
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,750
because I'm pretending
to be a "sexual deviant"

but come on,

how am I not supposed
to look at something

468
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,166
as wonderful as this?

469
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,291

on a trampoline.

and I enjoy wearing them.

00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,458
Well, in that case, I'll
continue to wear them sometimes.

479
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,958
But by no means will
I do so for your sake!

480
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,083
Of course, I know that.

481
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,083
You don't know anything!

482
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,125
[KIMITO]
Right!

483
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,750
[KIMITO]
This is nice.

00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,833
I don't know how to put it.
She's surprisingly, uh...

485
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
Uh... Why are you
staring at me like that?

486
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,125
[KIMITO]
Oh...

487
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,250
I was just thinking how
you'll make somebody

488
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,166
a happy husband one day.

489
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,625
Why would you say something
like that, you fool?!

490
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,041
Wait...

491
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,375
Unless you're suggesting
that perhaps you and I might--

492
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,041
I'm not ready for this!

[KIMITO]
Please calm down!

494
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,208
You're gonna tear my jacket!

495
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,666
[KAREN]
All done.

496
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,708
Great job.

497
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,125
Even when I look
at it really close,

498
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,916
I still can't tell
it was ripped.

499
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,083
Indeed.

500
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,833
Next to swordplay,
this is my best skill!

501
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,333
Well, I'm really impressed.

502
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,958
Seriously, my mom doesn't even
know how to sew like this.

503
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,500
Oh. It is early,

504
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,291
but if you wanted me to meet
your parents, I'd be willing.

505
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,333
[KIMITO]
Huh?

506
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,208
It appears that your
undershirt is cut as well.

507
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,208
Yeah, you're right.

508
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Then I'll have
to sew that, too.

509
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,708
Take off your shirt,
please. Quickly.

510
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,458
What? No, that's okay.

511
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,833
Just do it!

512
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,500
[KIMITO] If I give you my shirt,
I'll be half-naked.

[KAREN gasps]

You're not hurt, are you?

00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,125
No...

Good.

You have peculiar limbs.

[KIMITO]
Do I?

521

They're not like
any girl's I've seen.

But I don't get it.

523
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,000
They aren't all that much
larger than mine, so...

524
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,291
So then how is it that
you're able to overpower me

525
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,041
with such ease?

526
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,916
It really is
pointless, isn't it?

527
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,958
I always wanted
to be a swordsman.

528
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,041
From the start of my youth,
all I did was train to fight.

529
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,875
Maybe I was wasting my time.

530
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,500
I am a girl, after all.

531
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,291
Why try?

532
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,041
[KIMITO]
Don't say that.

You've worked your butt
off and it shows, Karen.

So what if you're a girl.
You can do anything you want.

536

Not to mention, you're one

and your dedication
to your craft.

Seeing someone
train as hard as you?

541
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,541
And never give up?

That's a beautiful thing.

You're serious, right?

You aren't gonna start laughing.
