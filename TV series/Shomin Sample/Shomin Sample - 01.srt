Thank you very much for coming.

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,625
I didn't wish
to create a big scene,

34
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,416
so I chose this method.

you failed, then!

Is this normally the way
you greet a stranger?

How very rude.

You are a Commoner

classical Japanese culture.

We value secrecy above all else,

Oh, yeah, sure!

66

[KUJO] You might say
this school exists

67
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,708
to be the academy of
modern female aristocracy.

68
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,000
Naturally, boys
are strictly prohibited.

Everyone on this
campus is a female.

Students, staff
and teachers alike.

And there has been
no exception to this rule.

However...

In recent years a certain
issue has complicated this.

What do you mean by "issue"?

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm the President.

00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,250
And a high school kid at heart!

Continue, Madam President.

80
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,958
First of all,

81
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,541
it looks like Miss Miyuki
was a little rough on you,

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,041
and I know that she's
very sorry for that.

83
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,083
Right?

84
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,416
Tell him how
sorry you are, please.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,041
[KUJO]
I do hope you'll forgive me.

[clicks tongue]

87
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Did you just click
your tongue at me?

88
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
So...

89
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,833
Tell me more about this
"issue" you're having.

90
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,833
[KUJO] After the girls
graduate from here,

91
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,958
though they may live among
the upper echelons of society,

92
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,250
once outside,
they cannot avoid contact

93
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,291
with the normal world.

94
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375
As such, students
are generally quite shocked

95
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,416
by the vast differences
between school life

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,041
and life outside these walls.

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,250
[KUJO]
Many fall hard.

98
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,375
Some even start
playing online games.

99
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,541
[KIMITO]
Hold on a second.

100
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,458
That's the "issue"
you were yakkin' about?

101
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,625
[PRESIDENT]
In these difficult times,

102
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,125
the consensus among
school leadership

103
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,708
is that we need to
inoculate our students

104
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,208
so they are better prepared
for life after school.

105
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
But it's a fine line.

106
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,458
We must prepare them, yes.

107
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,833
But not at the expense of
our long-standing tradition

108
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,416
of refined excellence.

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,833
And so...

110
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,458
That brings us to you.

111
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,666
You were selected as this
school's "Shomin Sample."

112
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,541
[KIMITO]
Okay. That's weird.

113
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,375
Incorrect.
It's not weird at all.

114
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,708
By inviting in a simple
Commoner like yourself,

115
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,958
and by having you live here
among your betters,

116
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,541
our students will
be more acclimated

117
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,125
to life after graduation.

118
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,458
[PRESIDENT]
Yes!

119
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,416
And with a boy, we kill
two birds with one stone!

120
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,958
[KUJO]
A lack of proper inoculation

121
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,208
against the opposite sex

122
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,500
has also been a problem
for our students.

123
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,708
[PRESIDENT] Oh, that's
one way of putting it!

124
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,583
But you're going to fix
all of that, I'm sure.

[KUJO] Well-known for
your caring nature,

137
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,125
you received the nickname
Sebastian in middle school.

138
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,916
You are average.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,458
And that's just how we want you.

140
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,000
"Middle of the pack,"
as you Commoners say.

141
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,458
I was kinda hoping
you were gonna say

142
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,625
you picked me 'cause
of how awesome I am.

143
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,208
You do have one
extraordinary quality.

144
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,958
A rare quality
that we did not find

145
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,791
in any of the other
dozens of candidates

146
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,583
under our consideration.

147
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,208
[KIMITO]
My good looks?

148
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,875
[KUJO]
Afraid not.

149
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,708
I mean your attraction to males!

150
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,958
[KIMITO]
Wha--?

151
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,541
[KUJO] Or, more specifically,
a muscle fetish,

152
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,041
by which you are only aroused
by macho, muscular body types.

153
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,708
That makes you a--

154
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,833
[KIMITO]
Slow down!

155
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,916
What's wrong?

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,625
[KIMITO]
I don't have a muscle fetish!

157
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,250
Oh, but I'm afraid you do.

158
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,541
You typically have
no contact with girls.

159
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,041
According to our research,

160
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,041
you choose to spend all of
your time around boys instead.

161
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,541
[KIMITO]
They're my friends!

162
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,750
[KUJO] If there was any doubt,
the clincher was testimony

163
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,625
from your sole
female friend, Eri.

164
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,041
Damn that girl.

165
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,375
Anyway, you're dead wrong.

166
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,666
I like the ladies, okay?

167
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,000
[PRESIDENT]
This is a problem.

168
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,500
[KUJO] Agreed, this is an
extremely serious situation.

169
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,250
[KIMITO]
What's the matter?

170
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,000
If you are truly not a
muscle-loving gay boy,

171
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,500
then in order
to keep our secret,

172
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,291
you must live out
your days in a remote place

173
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,958
you won't find on any map.

174
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,291
And if you stay here,

175
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,375
so as to preserve the
chastity of our students,

176
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,291
we will have to
remove your genitals.

177
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,708
I'm sorry, but there's
just no other way.

178
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,291
[KIMITO growls]

179
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:09,666
[KIMITO]
I love... muscles!

180
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,208
[PRESIDENT]
That's terrific news!

181
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,583
[KUJO] You have a surprisingly
delicate side, don't you?

182
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,041
That's certainly a relief.

183
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,791
From this moment forward,

184
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,875
this is the classroom you'll
want to report to every morning.

185
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,500
Remember, these
young ladies have had

186
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,333
almost no contact with boys,

187
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,041
so be careful not to
overstimulate them, okay?

188
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,166
[KIMITO]
Okay.

189
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,708
I'll let you two take it
from here, Miss Miyuki.

190
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,333
As you wish,
Madam President.

191
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,000
[REIKO]
My name is Reiko.

192
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,916
I'm the committee chairperson
of the first years,

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,125
and as such,
I am at your service.

194
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,666
Should you need anything at all,
please do let us know.

195
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,833
On behalf of all of the
first years, welcome.

196
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,833
We're thrilled
to have you among us.

197
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,458
We look forward to four
productive years of study.

198
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,375
Hi.

199
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm Kimito, and uh,
and I'm just a regular dude.

200
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,500
[STUDENTS]
Oh... my...

201
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,958
[MAYA] I cannot believe
he really said that!

202
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,666
[MIZUHO] I thought it was
just an old wives tale,

203
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,166
but it appears
Commoner men really do

204
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,375
refer to themselves as "dudes."

205
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,625
[REIKO clears throat]
Ladies, please.

206
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,375
[cell phone rings]

207
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,500
[KAE]
What is that?

208
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,083
[MAYA] Do you hear
that strange sound?

209
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,791
Ladies.
Stay calm, it's under control.

210
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,875
That's mine!

211
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,041
How rude.

212
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,166
But... What is it?

213
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,166
This is called
a cellular phone.

214
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,916
Or sometimes a smart phone,
depending on the model.

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,750
So strange.
So square. So dainty, too.

216
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,333
[KUJO]
As you can see,

217
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,583
it's a small telephone one can
carry around in one's pocket.

218
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,791
Such tools are widely used

219
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,791
amongst Commoners
like Kimito here.

220
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,583
[STUDENTS]
That is very neat!

221
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,791
I am beyond shocked!

222
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,291
Imagine something
so small and thin

223
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,833
being used as a telephone!

224
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,750
[chattering]

225
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,083
Pardon me.

226
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,500
But would it be all right
if I held it in my hand?

227
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,500
But of course.

228
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,500
Thank you, that's very kind.

229
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,666
Oh my! It's so dainty!

230
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,208
Imagine regularly using a
contraption as amazing as this!

231
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,750
It's wonderful.

232
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,708
Commoners truly are marvelous!

233
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,041
[REIKO]
Ladies.

234
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,666
That tiny telephone
is Kimito's property.

235
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,625
We must return it
to him at once.

236
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,125
[KAE] But how would one
do such a thing?

237
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,875
[MIZUHO] My heart feels like it
might leap out of my chest

238
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,916
just thinking of it!

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,625
I'll do the honor
on our behalf.

240
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,166
Perfect idea, Reiko!

241
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,041
There's no need
for us to fret now.

242
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,166
My dearest, sir.

243
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,708
Thank you for allowing
us to gaze upon

00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,500
your tremendous device.

[REIKO gasps]

246
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,208
Oh! Heavens,
what am I thinking?

247
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,708
Please forgive me for
my mistake, kind sir.

248
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,208
I will write you a
thank you note immediately!

That is the inimitable Reiko!

So considerate and refined.

Thank you very much.

Hey! What's your problem?

[AIKA]
You there!

262
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,333
[AIKA]
Kiss me. Now!

00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,375
Right now, Commoner!

C'mon then! Pucker up!

Duh! If you kiss a Commoner,

then all your wishes
will come true!

268
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,250
Now stop squirming
and give me a smooch

right here on the kisser!

[KIMITO] Your wishes
aren't gonna come true

271
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,791
just cause you kiss me!

You're wrong!

273
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,208
I know because
I was at a tea party

274
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,166
and I heard one of the
upperclassmen talk about it!

275
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,958
Look. Girl.

276
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,541
Who are you gonna believe,

277
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:40,458
some upperclassman who's never
been outside these walls, or me?

00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,250
Well... Whatever, man.

I don't believe that!

00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,083
What's next?

288
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,541
You'll tell me rolling around
and barking like a dog

Nope. She's not.

[REIKO]
There you are!

300
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,000
I am terribly sorry,
my dearest sir.

301
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,875
Your sudden departure
deeply concerned us.

302
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,833
We couldn't help
but search for you.

303
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,125
The way Aika
yanked you away

304
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,083
was troublesome,
to say the least.

305
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,291
Yes, we were
quite taken aback.

306
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,750
Anyway...

307
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,125
Not to pry, but what have
you two been doing out here?

308
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,583
Oh. Well, uh...

309
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,916
Are you all right, Aika?

310
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
Don't go!

311
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,958
Dear.

312
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,375
It appears Aika
has run away again.

313
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,125
What's up with her?

314
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,500
[REIKO]
She's a mystery.

315
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,375
For some reason,
she refuses to talk to anyone.

316
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,458
Poor thing.

317
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,958
We don't know why,

318
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,375
but I suspect it's a shortcoming
on the part of all of us.

319
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,708
[KUJO] Mr. Kagurazaka,
this is the dormitory

where you shall reside
during your time here.

00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,625
And, for your comfort
and consideration,

322
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,583
we have prepared a
special room for you.

323
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,416
We hope you find it suitable.

324
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,083
[KIMITO]
A special room?

325
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,208
[KUJO]
Yes.

326
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,500
We have spared no
expense in assuring

327
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,458
your accommodations will
be to your satisfaction.

328
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,416
Should you meet any issues,
I trust you will let us know.

329
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,666
[KIMITO]
Wow. Thanks a lot.

330
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,958
[KUJO]
My pleasure.

331
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,666
Well, here we are.

332
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:40,875
[KUJO] We had your
things brought here

333
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,750
from the Kagurazaka home.

334
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,375
We've reproduced your room
to near perfection.

335
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,166
I hope you are pleased.

336
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,916
Yup, this is
my room, all right.

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,333
[KUJO] After factoring in
freight costs,

338
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,916
construction expenses,

339
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,250
and other miscellaneous items
needed to maintain our secret...

340
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,708
This project cost us
one hundred million yen.

341
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,083
Wait... For real?

342
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,625
Who would've thought
that making something so cheap

343
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,541
could be so expensive?

344
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,541
But in the end, your comfort
is our number one priority.

345
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,208
[KIMITO]
This is insane.

346
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,000
[KIMITO]
Whoa!

347
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,458
[KUJO] If you truly are not
a muscle-loving gay boy--

348
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,375
[KIMITO yelling]

349
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,166
Please forgive me,
thigh collection.

350
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,708
I'm sorry!

351
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,541
What do you mean
thigh collection?

352
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,416
Are you referring to the
pictures of girls' thighs

353
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,375
you just tore down?

354
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,375
Wait, what? No!

355
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,625
So...

356
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,000
Am I to infer that your
muscle fetish is a lie?

357
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,458
[KIMITO]
Ooh! Gimme!

358
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,000
[KIMITO]
I love muscles!

359
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,416
Strange.

360
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,375
Oh... One more thing.

361
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,375
As of today,
I'm your personal maid.

362
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
Which means, whatever you need,

363
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,375
I'll see to it and make sure
it's done to your liking.

364
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,958
Well, that seems weird.

365
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,333
It's not weird.

366
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,125
At this school, students are
assigned a female maid

367
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,250
who looks after
their every need.

368
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,250
[KIMITO]
So then...

369
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,500
You have to do whatever I say?

370
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,375
[KUJO]
No.

371
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,500
Just because I'm assigned to you

372
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,916
doesn't mean I'll
do anything for you,

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,791
other than the
basic requirements.

374
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,208
[KIMITO]
Well, that's a bummer.

375
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,166
[KUJO]
Be ready.

376
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,416
In a few hours' time,

377
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,541
you'll participate in
an orientation meeting.

378
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,708
Till then,
I suggest you stay here

379
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,083
and try to get some rest.

380
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,666
You tricked me, Commoner!

381
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,166
I spun around 58 times

382
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,458
and barked all afternoon and
not a single wish came true!

383
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,208
[KIMITO] You'd think it
wouldn't take you 58 tries

384
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,791
to realize it wasn't happening!

385
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,250
[AIKA]
You shut your face!

386
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,208
It's not nice to trick
strangers, you know?

387
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
[KIMITO] You're the one who
jumped to the wrong conclusion.

388
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,666
I never thought you'd actually
do something so dumb

389
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,958
in the first place.

390
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,208
[AIKA]
Whoa... Your room.

391
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,583
I've never seen any
of this stuff before.

392
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,541
[KIMITO]
It's just regular old stuff.

393
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,166
[AIKA] This could be
my wish coming to life!

394
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,000
[KIMITO]
Uhh...

395
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
If I can learn to be common,

396
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,083
then everything I've ever
wanted in my wildest dreams

397
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,916
will come true!

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,916
I'd be the most popular
girl in the whole school

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,250
and everyone would love me!

400
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,750
[AIKA mumbling]

401
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,291
You're kidding me...

402
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,666
That's why you spun around and
barked like a dog 58 times?

403
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,500
Yeah.

404
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,208
That's right. So what?

405
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,750
It's fine to want that.

406
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,458
But you need to make friends,
not act like a big lunatic.

407
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,666
[KIMITO] Just be yourself
and treat people well,

408
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,750
and your wish'll come true.

409
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,166
Just being myself
won't get me anywhere.

410
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,541
You don't understand.
You're a Commoner.

411
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,208
[KIMITO]
Well, maybe I don't.

412
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,583
[KIMITO]
But...

413
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,875
[KIMITO] If you can
interact with others

414
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,333
the way you do with me

415
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,291
then I don't think you're
gonna have a problem at all.

416
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,375
You think so?

417
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,791
Yeah. That's my opinion.

418
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,208
The thing is...

419
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,666
I'm really bad when it comes
to not telling the truth.

420
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,750
It's a fault of mine.

421
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,875
I just blurt out
whatever's in my head.

422
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,458
Around here, that's
an unforgiveable sin.

423
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,041
Also, I'm really
scared of being disliked.

424
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
So that's why...

425
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,416
[KIMITO]
I see.

426
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,791
That's why you distance
yourself from them.

427
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,333
From your classmates.

428
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,000
It's hard.

429
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,541
Because I do wanna
be friends with people.

430
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,208
Being alone all
the time really sucks.

431
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,416
I want someone to talk to.

432
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,291
High school's supposed be fun.

433
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,791
But here I am, all by myself,

434
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,750
with no friends
to keep me company.

435
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,375
[AIKA]
It's pathetic, but in class,

436
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,958
I pretend to be asleep
most of the time.

437
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,541
And I'm always the
last one out the door

438
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,958
so I don't have to walk
with a big group.

439
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,625
But I hate it.
I'm tired of it!

440
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,083
[AIKA] I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

441
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,958
You're just a
Commoner, after all.

442
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,500
[KIMITO]
Here. You wanna play?

443
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,083
What is it?

444
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,625
It's just a game.

445
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,750
Whoa. Neat.

446
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,125
Yeah.

447
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:05,458
You flip the switch and then
you're off to the races.

448
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,458
[AIKA gasps]

449
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,666
Pretty cool, right?

450
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,000
It's so awesome!

451
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,666
Crap, I responded
honestly without thinking first!

452
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,375
It's humiliating to behave like
that in front of a Commoner!

453
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,791
I have to find a way
to change the subject!

454
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,333
But the damage is already done!

455
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,875
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

456
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
Spills right out, huh?

457
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,291
There's a lesson in everything.

458
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,041
Hey!

459
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,125
What's up?

460
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,333
I want you to teach me
to be a Commoner!

461
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,125
[KIMITO]
Uh...

462
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,625
You're an expert.

463
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,875
Look. Uh...

464
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,666
No offense, but everything
in here is common.

465
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,041
Like this game!

466
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,958
Right now, Commoners are
all the rage at our school.

467
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,708
People are crazy about 'em!

468
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,000
So if I can pick up a little
bit of Commoner culture,

469
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,125
then you know what?
[giggles]

470
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,375
Everybody'll be crazy
about me, too!

471
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll be the most
popular and beloved girl

472
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,625
in the whole school!

473
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,125
What say you?

474
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
There's no way I can make my
dream come true without you,

475
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,083
so what do you say?

476
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,916
Once I've become a master
of all things common,

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,250
I'll have so many new friends

478
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
I'll have to beat my
classmates off with a stick!

479
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,208
Hey, wait!

480
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,458
I know!

481
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,875
With you as my witness,

482
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,416
I hereby declare the creation
of the Commoner Club!

483
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,041
Uh... The what?

484
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,666
We just formed
a brand new club!

485
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,375
Which means we're
the founding members!

486
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,000
This is so much fun!

487
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,041
Wow!

488
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,458
Aren't you so
excited about this?

489
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,583
I've never formed
a real club before!

490
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,541
[AIKA]
Hey! You don't mind, right?

491
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
Well, I guess not.

492
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,208
[AIKA]
All right!

493
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,666
[laughing]

494
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,625
Commence Commoner Club
activities right now!

495
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,958
Definitely the first
thing I have to do

496
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,083
is master this crazy,
awesome game!

497
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,791
[KUJO] Do any of you have
questions for the Commoner?

498
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,833
[STUDENTS]
Me! Me!

499
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,708
All right.
Miss Yasuda has the floor.

500
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,583
I'm curious to know if you've
ever ridden a train before.

501
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,458
Yes. Yes, I have.

502
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,583
[STUDENTS gasping]

503
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,916
So... Good sir,

504
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,125
does this mean
that you paid money

505
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,708
and then subsequently
obtained a ticket

506
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,500
in exchange for your purchase?

507
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,416
Uh, no.

508
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,958
I don't really buy tickets.

509
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,708
[STUDENTS gasping]

510
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,250
[KIMITO]
You see...

511
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,666
This is called a passcard, and
for the sake of convenience,

512
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,458
you can fill it up
with money in advance

513
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,375
using cash or a credit card.

514
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,125
It's actually a
pretty great invention.

515
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,625
So you just touch it
to the ticket gate

516
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,000
and it automatically debits.

517
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,416
[STUDENT 1B]
That was fascinating.

518
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,541
But I didn't understand
a word of what he said.

519
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,041
[STUDENT 1C]
Compared to us,

520
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,875
the Commoners have a much more
complicated civilization.

521
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,208
[STUDENT 1D]
I feel inspired!

522
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,000
I never dreamed
I'd have the opportunity

523
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,750
to speak to a Commoner!

524
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,791
No! You got it all wrong!

525
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,500
Commoners really aren't that
big a deal, I promise you!

526
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,416
[STUDENT 1E]
No! They are magnificent!

527
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,791
[STUDENT 1F]
And impressive, too!

528
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,166
We hope to be able
to study your ways!

529
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,250
[STUDENT 1G] We wish to learn
everything we can from you!

530
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,208
[STUDENT 1H]
You're so incredible!

531
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,625
[AIKA]
Nailed it!

532
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,791
[AIKA]
And once I have,

533
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,916
I'll reveal my avatar
to the whole class!

534
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,750
[STUDENTS] You just have
to add hot water?

535
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,833
[AIKA]
See? See?

536
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:43,416
[KUJO] You have no idea how much
I wish you'd never woken up.

537
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,333
[REIKO] I'll just have
to have him take me.

538
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,958
I have no other choice!
