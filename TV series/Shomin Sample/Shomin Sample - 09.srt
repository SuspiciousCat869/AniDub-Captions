Kimito and Hakua,

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,125
it seems the chemistry between
you is neither good nor bad.

00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,958
Because Hakua hardly ever speaks

00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,625
and is not much of
a communicator,

00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,833

work extremely hard

So then that means--?

00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,791
[SAKIMORI] Exactly what
you're thinking, yes!

18
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,541
Miss Hakua wants to know
Mr. Kagurazaka better,

If that's what the lady wants

Let's arrange for them to

Excellent idea!

Yes, but, we musn't

[AIKA] Hey, Kimito. Have you
heard of a maid café before?

32
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,541
What is that?

33
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,875
[KAREN]
Sounds weird.

34
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,500
[exhales]

35
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,166
Well, you know what
a café is, right?

36
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,875
It's one of those,
but with maids.

37
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,833
Huh? Hold on a second.
When we first met,

38
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,333
you told me that Commoners
don't have any maids.

39
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,750
But when I started reading your
Manga, they were everywhere.

40
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,833
Yeah, that's true.

41
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,916
[AIKA] And they're
super weird, too!

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,541
Nothing like normal maids!

43
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,875
[gasps]

44
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,416
[AIKA] Like there was
one about a gun-obsessed,

45
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,958
former-terrorist robot-maid
who's super horny all the time

46
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,958
and has slimy, octopus-like
tentacles growing out of her!

00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,416
You nasty pervert!

Hey, relax!

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,208
The maids from my manga are
supposed to be fantasies!

50
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,875
Commoners don't have maids.

51
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,833
And they wouldn't be
horny robots if we did.

52
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,125
So a maid café
is a fantasy, too?

53
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,916
It is. The maid's in a maid
café aren't like the maids

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,541
who work at this school
and make your bed

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,291
or do your laundry or whatever.

56
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,916
These maids do role play.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,041
Like they're actually
from a manga.

58
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,125
[ALL] Like they're
actually from a manga?

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,791
Since manga girls aren't real,

60
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,083
some guys go to these cafes
to live out their fantasies.

65
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,583

It's like they say,

00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,166
"people always want
what they can't have."

67

Cafe maids are like
an unattainable ideal.

and found out that everyone

75
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,291
has a maid assigned to
them I was kind of excited.

76
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,041
I mean, these maids
aren't cartoon characters.

77
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,958
They're real,
honest to goodness maids!

78
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,500
Then, Kimito....

79
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,250
Am I to infer from this that
you have a thing for maids?

80
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,416
[KIMITO]
Yeah!

these maid cafes!

have questions, or--?

how many people

She's role-playing.

00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,416
[KIMITO] All right.
Let's pick up from

162
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,541
where you bring me the
rice omelet, shall we?

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,750
Here. One rice omelet.

164
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,916
Just let me know if
you need anything else.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,291
And, I will now include
a secret ingredient

166
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,583
to make sure
it tastes good.

167
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,041
So get ready, master. Here goes.

168
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,500
Oh, did you order a rice omelet?

169
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,625
Well...

170
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,875
Here's some love, too--

171
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,458
Ack! I'm sorry, I can't!

172
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,083
It's just so embarrassing,
how could I--

173
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,375
[KIMITO]
Apologize to me

174
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,500
and to maid cafés everywhere
right this minute!

175
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,208
I will draw a bunny
rabbit with this ketchup!

176
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,375
That's oddly good.

177
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,541
[AIKA] Bad Hakua!
Put your clothes back on!

pleasure with all of my love!

181
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,875
[KIMITO] Karen, I've gotta
be honest with you,

182
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,875
I'm not gonna eat that.

183
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,916
So you're in charge of games.

184
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,958
The secret ingredient,
is a little love.

185
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,250
This. This. Or this.

186

The secret ingredient--

189
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,583
[KIMITO]
Oh, we're playing again?

190
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,875
Okay.

191
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,250
The secret ingredient
is a little love.

192
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,458
This. This. Or this.

193
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,458

[KIMITO]
There's no rule that says

197
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,875
you play till the maid wins.

198
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,333
All right then.

199
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,875
That's enough game time for
one day, don't you think?

200
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,291
So, master.

201
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,416
Now that we're past that,
what's next on the agenda?

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,833
Well. Let's see. There is
the singing and dancing.

203
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh! I love to sing, more than
anything in the world!

204
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,500
Please, allow me!

205
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,791
Thanks, you idiot! Do you have
any idea what you've done?

206
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,916
Huh?

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,833
[REIKO]
Master!

208
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,208
I'm grateful for
this opportunity

209
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,708
and I promise I'll do my best!

210
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,625
[AIKA]
No, don't let her!

211
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,791
Please indulge me
in "Ave Maria."

It's great, but we've
heard enough!

[AIKA]
Please, stop singing!

221
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,583
You sound like a

[singing]

223

You're a no-talent hack!

224
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,208
Well. How very rude.
People always compliment me

225
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,833
on how gifted I am
at singing opera.

226
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,416
[AIKA] Then they're
sparing your feelings!

227
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,708
They don't have the heart to
tell you that every time you

228
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,791
sing their souls start
to shrivel up and die!

229
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,041

Uh! Hakua!

Just keep arguing, Kimito.

233
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,208
And wherever the blood
trail leads, don't follow it.

Stop being so creepy!

If you don't get off of her,

238
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,291
I'm gonna put you in
time out, you understand?

00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750

Sorry to interrupt,

but I thought you
might need some help.

243
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,833
The rest of the maids and I will
wash these clothes for you.

244
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,958
Why don't you all go back
to your rooms and change?

245
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,625
That's another thing
that's completely different

246

about actual maids.

[KIMITO] Cafe maids
do a lot of things,

249

but cleaning isn't one of them.

For real.

253

[AIKA]
What about laundry?

00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,541
Or dressing you?

255
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,791
Or seeing you off
in the morning?

256
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,083
[KIMITO]
Yeah, no. None of the above.

[KAREN]
Correct me if I'm wrong here.

258
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,416
They serve you food.

259
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,625
They play silly,
role-playing, love games.

260
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,250
But when it comes to
personal care, they do nothing?

261
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,125
[KIMITO]
Yep.

262
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,708
That's ridiculous.

263
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,625
Can you even call that a maid?

264
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,750
So then. What is
the final verdict,

265
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,083
do you like Commoner
maids or not?

Hey! Thanks again for
everything you did earlier.

My pleasure.

00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,125
You real-world maids are
something else, that's for sure.

Do you think so?

00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,083
Oh! I forgot!

275
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,958
If you are agreeable
to the idea,

276
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,375
would you like to come see
us at work sometime soon?

Sure. Sounds interesting.

Thanks for having me.

[KIMITO]
I know I've been here before,

282
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,500
but now that I'm
seeing it again,

283
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,875
This place really
is massive, isn't it?

284
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,958
[SAKIMORI] It only takes
three dozen maids to clean,

285
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,791
so not really.

286
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,291
Well. Would you like me to give
you quick tour of the facility?

287

[KIMITO]
Hm? Yeah. Thanks.

Not cool. It's really amazing!

303
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,958
So, Miss Hakua.
How would you feel about

304
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,958
showing this handsome young
man around the facility?

305
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,500
Uh. But I came here
to watch the maids--

00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,583
Well, nevermind.

307

[MAIDS]
Aww!

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,625

Come. We should get going.

This is my sandbox.

311
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,250
[HAKUA]
I use it to clear my mind.

312
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,541
[KIMITO]
That makes sense.

313
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,208
So then, you designed
this sandcastle?

314
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,875
Wow, it's immaculate.

315
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,625
[KIMITO]
Anything I can do to help?

316
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,208
[KIMITO]
All right.

Hello. As it turns out, all of
us are on a ten-minute break.

320
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,208
Even maids need
a little "r and r.'

321
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,250
[MAIDS]
Yes, indeed!

322
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,791
Please pay us no more mind

323
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,750
than a tiny pebble
on the side of a road.

324
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,791
Weird.

325
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,250
[KIMITO]
So, what are we making?

326
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,666
A house. Will you
gather sand too?

327
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,708
[KIMITO]
Sure.

328
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
[KIMITO]
Hm? What's wrong?

329
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,166
[KIMITO] I guess my
hands are pretty big.

330
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,208
[KIMITO] Or maybe yours
are just really small.

331
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,250
[KIMITO laughs]
That won't make 'em any bigger.

[KIMITO]
Don't punch me!

334
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,291
There's nothing wrong
with small hands!

00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,750
[MAIDS gasp]

336
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,250
Need anything, or...?

337
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,583
Nothing. We're great. Thanks.
Don't stop on our account.

338
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,666
Wait. Don't stop what?

339
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,166
Whatever you were doing.

340
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,750
[KIMITO]
All done!

341
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,791
Awesome house.

342
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,375
Miss Hakua.

343
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,916
It's half past noon, would you
like me to prepare your lunch?

344
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,708
It's that late already?

345
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,291
Well, are you hungry at all yet?

346
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,791
[stomach growls]

347
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,166
That answers that.

348
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,791
You really must
join us, Mr. Kagurazaka.

349
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,833
We'd be oh, so
honored if you did.

350
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,125
[KIMITO]
No, I shouldn't.

351
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,250
[SAKIMORI]
It's really no trouble.

352
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,958
It would be our
privilege to tend to

353
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,500
one of the friends
of our lady. Truly!

354
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,041
[KIMITO] Well, in that case,
I don't mind if I do.

355
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,875
So--?

356
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,041
What timing, it's lunch
for the maids as well.

357
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,750
Pay us no attention!

358
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,666
Think of us as nothing
more than lawn clippings!

359
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,375
[KIMITO]
Uh...

360
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,750
[SAKIMORI]
My apologies.

361
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,500
We're short on plates,
so I'm afraid the two of you

362
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,083
will have no choice
but to share one.

363
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,541
[KIMITO]
What?

364
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,541
We're hopeless romantics,
so we always draw hearts

365
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,625
on the most random
things you can imagine.

366
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,625
It says our names.

367
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,541
Oh, does it?

368
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,750
[KIMITO]
Not to be a bother,

369
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,875
but could I trouble
you for an extra plate?

370
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:26,791
[SAKIMORI]
What?

371
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,208
I'd like my own plate, please.

372
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,875
As I said, we have an unexpected
shortage at the moment.

373
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,083
Huh? But what
about those plates?

374
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,208
There's a whole
stack right--

375
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,333
[yells]

376
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm so sorry. All of those
plates are now broken.

377
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,875
I'm so sorry. All of those
plates are now broken.

378
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,250
[KIMITO] Oh, come on,
that was clearly deliberate!

379
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,666
The work of a maid is grueling,
taxing and difficult,

380
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,500
to say the least. As such,

381
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,250
sometimes the stress causes
us to make terrible mistakes.

382
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,458
[KIMITO]
Yeah. Right. "Mistakes."

383
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, the plate debacle aside.
It is time to eat lunch!

384
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,041
Bon appetite.

385

Is it good?

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,125
All right, then.

391
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,083
[MORITA] We're not
even here right now.

392
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,541
Think of us as a
residual thought

393
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,000
from the past, bouncing
through space and time.

'Scuse me. Can I
have a spoon, too?

I wish I could oblige you.
But as fate would have it,

397
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,791
we're short on spoons, so please
continue indirectly kissing.

398
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,041
[KIMITO]
Uh...

399
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,916
Oops. Did I say kissing?
I didn't mean kissing.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,541
I meant kiss-met-ting!

401
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,375
[KIMITO] Hey, look! I think I
solved your spoon problem.

[KIMITO groans]

405
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Poor thing. She fears silver.

406
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,458
Like a werewolf, she spooks
even at the mention of it.

407
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,166
Morita, you must be exhausted.

408
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,041
[KIMITO]
Sounds psychosomatic.

409
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,125
She should see
someone about that.

try it at least. Thanks.

starting to get exciting!

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,333
Thought you might like
something to drink.

Oh! Thank you very mu-- Ah...

is our only cup you see.

Now, I know that can't be true!

423

only straw we have in stock.

anyone have a goofy thing

like that in the first place?
Look right there!

a whole box of 'em!

My apologies,

428
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,416
but those straws are
defective and of no use to us.

[KIMITO] Okay, one or
two being defective, I buy,

00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,041
but that many?

431
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,041
I mean, how bad could straw
makers suck at their jobs?

to drink or not?

It's almost like watching two

What? No it's not.

I just don't see her like that.

I mean, we're close, yeah.

And I like spending
time with her.

But it's nowhere near romantic.

If anything,

There was no
response in the lab,

so the inquiry was
forwarded to me instead.

00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,875
Congratulations girls,
today was a massive success!

480
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,791
Though, it was quite surprising
when the head maid came around.

481
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,041
Speaking of which,

482
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,166
did you know it was her
who chose Mr. Kagurazaka

483
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
to be Seikain's Shomin Sample?

484
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,250
Yes, I did. I hear
the powers that be

485
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,083
were all set to pick
another candidate.

486
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,708
But then the head
maid put a word in

487
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,208
and they went with Kimito.

488
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,500
That's unusual. I wonder what
inspired that suggestion.

489
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,916
It's obvious. The young
commoner has a fine reputation.

490
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,458
[MAID 3B]
Well, in at any rate,

491
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,166
we owe the head maid our thanks
for bringing Mr. Kagurazaka

492
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,416
into the fold!

493
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,125
Here's to many successes
from this day on!

494
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,875
And to the Seikain maids!

495
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,625
[MAIDS]
Here, here!

496
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,166
[gasps]

497
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,583
Oh! You want
your dinner, master?

498
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,375
Well. Here it is then.

499
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,000
With a little love!

500
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:22,916
[KAREN] Oh! So you're
in charge of games?

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,541
[HAKUA, KAREN] The secret
ingredient is a little love.

502
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,416
This. This. Or this.

503
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,916
Paper, rock, or...

504
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,708
scissors!

505
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,083
[gasps]

506
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,458
Oh! You wanna order
somethin' to drink, huh?

507
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:39,416
Well. Here it is, then.
Served. With a little love.

508
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,791
[AIKA groans]

509
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,250
So embarrassing!

510
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,333
[KUJO]
What are your intentions?

511
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,916
[KIMITO]
Guys are better, you know.

512
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,625
[ALL] We love muscles!
We love muscles!

513
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,541
You got me mad now!

514
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,666
Yakiniku seasoning.

515
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,541
I love muscles!

516
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,833
Dandy Aika? I like
the sound of that!
