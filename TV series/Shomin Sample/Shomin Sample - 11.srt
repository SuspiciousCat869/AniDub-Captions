00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,625
[chuckles]

00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,333
[gasps]

4
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,708
Hello, Kimito.

5
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,125
Hey, what's up?

6
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,833
[REIKO] We were running
low on chalk, so--

7
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,500
What, you have the daily rounds?

8
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,625
Oh no. As a matter of fact,

9
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm just doing this
of my own accord.

10
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,375
I wanted to ensure the teachers
have everything they need

11
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,208
to effectively do their jobs.

12
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,833
Cool.

13
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,083
And what brings
you here, Kimito?

14
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,875
[KIMITO]
I forgot my pencil case.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,875
That's certainly unlike you.

16
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,416
[KIMITO]
Oh. Is it?

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,291
I've always found you to be
extremely thoughtful, at least.

18
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,166
You think so, eh?

19
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,291
Oh, yes, I absolutely do.

20
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,333
[gasps]

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:01,041
[REIKO sighs]
What a beautiful sunset.

22
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,458
[KIMITO]
Yeah, it is.

23
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,958
I still can't get over how
clean the sky is out here.

24
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,250
Are the skies where you live

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,708
different from those
over Seikain Academy?

26
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,208
Yeah, it's much
less polluted here,

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,958
and there's way more of view.

28
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,291
Regardless, I would love
to visit a city one day.

29
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,750
Huh?

30
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,666
What? Why are you
staring at me like that?

31
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,041
--Sorry, my bad.
--[giggles]

32
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,083
[REIKO]
How about I close the window?

33
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,041
Truth is. Although I'd
love to see the city,

34
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,666
it's wishful thinking to
believe I'll ever go there.

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not much like what
you saw at Shomin land,

36
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,541
but I'd be glad to take you.

37
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,375
If anyone deserves to have their
wishes come true, it's you.

38
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,333
Do you mean that, Kimito?

39
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,875
Well, of course, did you
have something in mind?

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,291
Perhaps.

41
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,125
No reason to hold
back around me.

42
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,916
There is something.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,250
Forgive me if this comes
across as disrespectful,

44
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,541
but I've noticed
you're still having

45
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,500
a difficult time
in botany class.

46
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,083
Yeah. I totally suck
at that subject.

47
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,166
Pretty sure I'm the
worst one in there.

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,875
The botanical arts happen to be
one of my greatest passions,

49
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,416
and if I may be so bold,

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,875
I wouldn't mind teaching you
some of the things I've learned.

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,541
If that's all right?

52
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
[giggles]

53
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,958
I'd love to help.

54
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,500
Sure, I'm always down
to learn new things.

55
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm so glad to hear it!
Then it's a date!

56
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,583
[KIMITO] Okay?

57
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,833
[REIKO]
I'm free any day this weekend,

58
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,958
is Saturday or
Sunday best for you?

59
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,458
I'm good with either!

60
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,083
I promise I'll do
everything I can

61
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,208
to make you a plant enthusiast!

62
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,291
[KIMITO]
Thanks.

63
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,375
Also. May I ask one
tiny favor of you?

64
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,958
[KIMITO]
Sure.

65
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,166
Unless you object, I don't want
you to call me Reiko anymore.

66
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
I would prefer a nickname.

67
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,791
From now on I'd love it
if you called me "Rei."

68
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,125
Yeah. Um, you don't
usually get to pick

69
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,333
your own nickname In
the Commoner World.

70
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,291
[REIKO]
Promise you'll call me Rei!

71
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,458
[KIMITO]
Hm...

72
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,291
[KIMITO]
I will definitely consider it.

73
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,458
[AIKA] So? What's on the
docket for the Commoner Club?

74
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,333
I don't know. Is there anything
you want to do, Reiko?

75
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,791
Now hold on moment.
You called me Reiko.

76
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,875
Have you forgotten what
you'd promised me?

77
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,625
Uh... So I did. Totally forgot.

78
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,458
What are you
two talking about?

79
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,208
I'm afraid it's
our little secret.

80
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
Between Kimito and I.

81
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a secret?

82
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,000
What the heck do
you mean a secret?!

83
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,625
Tell us! Now!

84
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,125
What I mean is.

85
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
I couldn't care less about
the details of your friendship.

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,541
But as a member of the
prestigious Commoner Club,

87
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,500
One devoted entirely
to its success.

88
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,583
I feel we are all entitled
to know this secret

89
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,083
on the ancient Samurai
principle that open and honest

90
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,166
communication
is the only path

91
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,250
to a healthy and
prosperous community.

92
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,291
Karen, you are aware that
you're holding a katana

93
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,541
to my throat, right?

94
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,833
It's a secret that's
just between us two.

95
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,458
Something Kimito and I share.

96
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,708
Uh-huh...

97
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,625
Stop with your games, jerk!
And tell us what it is!

98
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,625
Honestly, is this sort of
violence really necessary?

99
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,791
[knocking]

100
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,833
Come in.

101
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,833
Sorry to interrupt.

102
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,166
What is it?

103
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,916
We have news, Miss.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,166
What sort of news?

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,375
[KIRYU] Hoko and Masaomi
have just arrived at Seikain.

106
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,500
My mother and brother
are here right now?

107
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,541
Yes, they are waiting for you
in the President's office.

108
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,125
Well, this is unexpected.

109
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,666
Do you happen to know
what this is regarding?

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,541
No, ma'am.

111
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,958
How unusual.

112
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,958
Forgive me everyone.
My family requires me.

113
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,958
Kimito, her mother would
like you to come as well.

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,000
For real?

115
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,750
[AIKA grumbles]

116
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,000
[MASAOMI] I am firmly
against this, mother!

117
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,500
[HOKO] Keep your opinions
to yourself, Masaomi.

118
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,291
[knocking]

119
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,958
[KIRYU] Excuse me,
but per your request,

120
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,041
I have Reiko and
Mr. Kagurazaka here to see you.

121
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,375
Come on in.

122
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,583
[chuckles]

123
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,375
Greetings, dear Mother. I have
missed seeing you so much.

124
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,166
I am incredibly grateful

125
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,291
that you've come to
visit me in person.

126
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,458
And I am delighted to see
my beautiful, darling daughter.

127
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,125
I do hope you're well.

128
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,541
Of course.

129
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,041
Truth be told, I've never
been so happy in my life.

130
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,625
I have no doubt of that.

131
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,333
How wonderful for you, my Love.

132
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,375
[gasps]

133
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,375
[KIMITO]
Hm?

134
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,416
[gasps]

135
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,250
[HOKO]
You.

136
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,791
Uh. Yes, ma'am?

137
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,916
[HOKO]
Your name?

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,916
Right. I'm Kimito Kagurazaka.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Ah. Of course.

140
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,958
Huh?

141
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,250
I'm pleased to have the
opportunity to ascertain

142
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,000
for myself what sort of
person the "Shomin Sample" is.

143
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,833
This is a disgrace,
we cannot sit back

144
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,000
and allow a boy to
remain here at Seikain!

145
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,458
It endangers Reiko's sanctity,
her virtue and her honor!

146
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,166
Trust me, there's no
cause for alarm.

147
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,416
Darling, Sister,
are you safe here?

148
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,125
Has something terrible
befallen you?

149
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,500
Not at all. Everyone's treated
me with the utmost kindness.

150
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,791
I'm quite fine.

151
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,166
[sighs]

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,375
[KIMITO] Yuck! It's almost
like his eyes are saying,

153
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,041
"my sister's the cutest thing
in the whole wide world."

154
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,500
My sister's the cutest thing
in the whole wide world.

155
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
[KIMITO]
He said it!

156
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,541
Keep your distance, commoner.
If you lay a finger on her,

157
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,833
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget!

158
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,083
That's not polite, brother.
Please be nicer to my friends!

159
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,750
[MASAOMI whimpers]

160
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,125
Apologize to him right now,
do you hear me?

161
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,125
[MASAOMI gasps]
Are you in earnest?

162
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,250
[REIKO] Until I hear "I'm sorry"
come out of your mouth,

163
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,166
you and I have nothing to
say to each other. Hmph!

164
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,750
But... Reiko, I--

165

[KUJO] You needn't concern
yourself with him, Masaomi.

166
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,083
He's male. But regardless,
it's not possible for him

167
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,500
to do harm to Reiko or
any of the girls here.

168

How can you say such
a ridiculous thing?

169
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,958
[KUJO] Because Kimito is not
your typical teenage boy.

170
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,166
He can only be sexually
aroused by men.

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,500
More specifically,
their muscles.

172
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,958
Isn't that correct?

173
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,916
Nice traps, big boy, I can
tell you've been to the gym!

This freak will do irreparable
harm to Reiko's future!

177
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,833
Being in close proximity
to this deviant

178
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,375
can only serve to pervert
her idea of what a man is!

you remove him at once!

[GASPS]

The day after tomorrow,
we will go to the home

00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,916
of your future husband, Satoshi
Konoe, and pay our respects.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,958
So you'll be coming
home with me today.

[gasps]

192

[HOKO] You are familiar
with the Konoe's, yes?

193
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,208
You met Kenichi, the family
head, at a recital last winter.

194
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,791
After a series of private
conversations between us.

195
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,750
Kenichi has deemed your
marriage a suitable one.

196
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,541
Like us, the Konoe family
is a legendary dynasty,

197
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,958
and to marry a Konoe
is a tremendous honor.

198
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,541
Young Satoshi is expected
to graduate with honors

from the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.

200

You should consider
yourself very lucky.

what I want at all.

I do hope our paths cross again.

[AIKA]
In the old days,

210
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,958
Seikain was a place wealthy
men went, to look for brides.

211
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,458
They were allowed
to visit campus

212
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,000
during certain school
functions as "spectators".

213
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,541
When they found a
female companion

214
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,083
they were interested in,

215
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,625
they would approach her family
about marriage negotiations.

216
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,125
After they came
to an agreement,

217
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,416
the female student would
take a leave of absence.

218
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,708
Then she'd go off
and get married

219
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,458
and never come
back til graduation.

Are you sure you're all right?

I didn't realize crap
like that still happened.

The Arisugawa dynasty

traditional customs.

you so upset about?

all right with this?

don't think this is okay.

how great your family name is.

to be about love!

were in Reiko's position,

[REIKO] The entire purpose
of my attending Seikain

was so I could be paired

No.

But my family deeply respects
the old traditions.

As a daughter of the
Arisugawa dynasty,

This is the first time
we've spoken on phones.

317
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,625
Wait what?

318
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,833
Where did that come from?

319
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,791
[REIKO] I know we've done our
fair share of quarreling, Aika.

320
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,916
[AIKA gasps]

321
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,416
[REIKO]
But that's the past.

322
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,750
And it all seems
so far away now.

323
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,500
[REIKO] I know this
might sound peculiar,

324
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,500
but I enjoyed our bickering.

325
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,500
[whimpers]

326
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,750
[REIKO]
Perhaps one of these days,

327
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,833
I'll be able to visit
Seikain and say hello.

328
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,625
But until then--

329
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,375
Just stop it!

330
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,166
You can't leave, Reiko!
Who's gonna pair up with me

331
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,250
when I'm by myself in
gym or be my roomie

332
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,708
on the next class field trip?

333
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,458
[REIKO gasps]

334
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,416
If you abandon me and the
rest of the Commoner Club,

335
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't know what I'll do.
Please, Reiko. I'm begging you!

336
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,958
Stay with us!

337
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,625
I'm against this engagement!

338
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,000
We all are!

339
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,708
So if you don't want to
marry that guy, then don't!

340
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,250
[REIKO]
You're right.

341
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,250
[AIKA gasps]

342
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,333
[REIKO]
I don't want to marry him.

343
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't want to
leave my friends!

344
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,000
[AIKA gasps]

345
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,458
[REIKO]
I want to stay at Seikain.

346
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,500
[REIKO] I want to stay there
with Karen. And with Hakua.

347
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,166
And most of all, I want
to stay with you, Aika.

348
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:59,583
[REIKO sobs]
I'm so scared.

349
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,916
I've no idea what I should do.

350
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,250
[AIKA] Don't worry,
we'll think of something.

351
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,291
One way or another,
we'll get you out of this!

352
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,583
[AIKA gasps]

353
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,833
[KIMITO]
Huh? Are you okay?

354
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,250
No, I'm not. Look. I, um--

355
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,041
[KIMITO]
Is this about Reiko?

356
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,250
If you have something
to say, then spit it out!

357
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,416
She said she doesn't
want to marry him, okay?!

358
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
[gasps]

359
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,708
I talked to her. She said
she wants to stay at Seikain

360
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,750
and she doesn't want to
leave any of her friends behind!

361
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,916
Not Hakua. Not Karen. Not me.

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,708
[REIKO]
If I had to leave Kimito behind,

363
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,833
I don't know what I'd do.

364
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,375
And not you!

365
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,166
I see.

366
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,750
So I told her we'd figure
something out no matter what,

367
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,625
but the truth is I don't have a
freakin' clue where to begin!

368
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,541
--[door opens]
--[BOTH] Huh?

369
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,041
We feel that our only recourse

370
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,333
is to go to her house
and make a direct plea.

371
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,000
I agree. Let's do this.

372
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
'Kay, but what's the plan?

373
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,583
Just walk in?

374
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,875
[KIMITO]
Uh...

375
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,083
Remember when Reiko's brother

376
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,625
tried to give me
his email address?

377
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,708
I bet he was trying to
send us some kind of

378
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,166
message or something.

379
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,500
That creepo's definitely got
some kinda sister complex,

380
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,583
but I'm pretty sure he's
against the engagement.

381
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,958
Although I didn't have time
to actually get his email.

382
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,791
It's okay. I've got it here.

383
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,916
Awesome work, Hakua!

384
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,583
[KIMITO] So he is
against this engagement.

385
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,833
[KAREN]
Then I've no choice

386
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,541
but to put this would-be
suitor down. He dies!

387
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,833
No, he does not!

388
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,041
It's pretty brave of us,

389
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,916
breaking up such a high
profile engagement.

390
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,833
I think these families
could have us killed.

391
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,375
Yes, we are brave!

392
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,875
Either that, or we've
completely lost our minds.

[KIMITO]
Don't worry, guys.

396
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,458
It's all right. This is
a job for a Commoner!

397
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,875
Okay everyone, we're almost
to the parking lot.

398
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,958
[KUJO] Where exactly do
you think you're going?

399
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,791
At such a late hour,

400
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,208
I can only imagine you're
up to some sort of mischief.

401
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,875
Or perhaps you're
teaching these ladies

402
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,125
the virtues of the
male physique.

403
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,458
[KIMITO] Oh, come on!
Don't be ridiculous!

404
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,250
Then what is your explanation?

405
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,916

It's Reiko. She needs help.

[AIKA grunts]

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,041
[KUJO] So this is a
Commoner Club activity?

[BOTH gasp]

409

Then it's none of my concern.

[KIMITO]
Uh...

411
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,333
But there is one
thing I have to know.

412
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,916
[KIMITO]
What?

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,125
I want you to tell me the real
reason why you're doing this.

414
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,375
Because she's a member
of the Commoner Club.

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,541
Have a pleasant evening.
