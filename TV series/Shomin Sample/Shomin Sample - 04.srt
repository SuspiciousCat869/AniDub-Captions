1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,083
What say you?

2
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,250
There's no way I can make my
dream come true without you,

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,416
so what do you say?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,083
I know!

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,500
With you as my witness,

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,875
I hereby declare the creation
of the Commoner Club!

7
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,916
[REIKO]
We don't know why,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but I suspect
it is a shortcoming

9
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,375
on the part of all of us.

10
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,500
I'd rather have you do it.

11
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,916
[AIKA]
Huh? Wait!

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,125
That doesn't make any sense.

13
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,916
Why would you rather
have me than Reiko?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,250
Sometimes Commoners
give their friends

15
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,500
sarcastic nicknames.

16
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,750
It's a sign of affection.

17
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,375
It's kinda like Commoner
slang or street talk.

18
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,666
But it appeared the two of you
were getting on splendidly.

19
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,458
My master plan to
become the most popular

20
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,041
and beloved girl
in all of Seikain!

21
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,708
There's no way I can fail!

22
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:14,458
[bell chiming]

23
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,041
[KIMITO]
A tea party? Today?

24
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,291
[REIKO] Yes.
Only if you want to, of course.

25
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,916
I don't mean to give
the wrong impression,

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,333
it's a small affair.

27
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,875
But we'll be
gathering in my room

28
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,833
and it would mean a great deal
to me if you were to attend.

29
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,166
Oh, no!

30
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,125
I don't mean anything
by saying it's in my room!

31
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,583
But... you see...

32
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,375
Well, it's something
of a tradition.

33
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,500
And if you were to come,

34
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,541
I would be deeply
honored and humbled.

35
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,500
[REIKO]
Oh. You're too busy.

36
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,666
I understand completely,
don't say another word.

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,583
Perhaps you can join us
at a later time.

38
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,041
She's right.
It is an old tradition of ours.

39
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,375
But Kimito, please
understand your being invited

40
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,250
is a very special request
put forth because--

41
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,208
Kae... She's knows
not of what she speaks.

42
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,625
[KIMITO]
Noted.

43
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,958
[REIKO]
As I was saying...

44
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,541
Do you have any plans
or obligations

45
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,875
after school, Kimito?

46
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,041
Well, no. I'm pretty free.

47
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,750
Won't you come with us?

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,625
[KIMITO]
Sure. Sounds like a good time.

49
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,291
[AIKA]
Hold on a second!

50
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,208
What do you mean?
You're not free!

51
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,625
What, did you forget?

52
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,083
We have plans tonight!

53
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,291
[REIKO]
Go on, Aika.

54
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,708
Don't end your conversation
with Kimito on our account.

55
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,375
Uh... Right.

56
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,083
[KIMITO]
Be right back.

57
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,708
[AIKA]
You forgot about the club!

58
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,416
[KIMITO]
Huh?

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,916
Jerk. Don't "huh" me!

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,833
Look. I have a plan
and I need your help!

61
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,208
I don't have time
for you to be carrying on

62
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
at some tea party, okay?

63
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,541
Wait, what do you mean,
carrying on?

64
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,708
You know what I mean!

65
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,000
[KIMITO]
No, I don't.

66
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,291
Besides, how urgent
could this plan be?

67
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,666
[AIKA]
What's the deal with you?

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,125
Do you really want
to see Reiko's room

69
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,666
that badly, creeper?

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,708
No.

71
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,041
That's not it at all,
you weirdo.

72
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,916
I need to get
this plan rolling!

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,333
No playing house with Blondie.
We've got work to do!

74
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,875
Fine. Just give me a sec.

75
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,708
Sorry, but I'm
not gonna make it.

76
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,208
Made plans with the butterfly.

77
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,416
I see.

78
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,625
[KIMITO]
Forgive me?

79
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
Don't give it another thought.

80
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,583
Go do what you need to do.

81
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,375
I hope your business with
Aika is a tremendous success.

82
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,833
Thanks a lot. Hey, Wait up!

83
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
[MAYA]
It's too bad about Kimito.

84
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,583
I was really looking forward
to him coming today.

85
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,291
[REIKO]
He had a prior engagement.

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,166
There was nothing
to be done about it.

87
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,041
What is this prior engagement
to which you are referring?

88
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,416
If I was forced
to venture a guess,

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,083
I would assume his
plans are with Aika.

90
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,416
After all, the two
of them are very close.

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,958
[REIKO]
They are together, yes,

92
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,166
Perhaps because she urgently
needed his advice on something.

93
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,416
His advice?

94
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,291
[REIKO]
Yes.

95
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,708
It seems perfectly obvious to me

96
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,375
that Aika is distressed
by the current circumstances

97
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,791
between us.

98
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,458
That must be why she sought out
Kimito's wise counsel.

99
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,791
He is an outstanding gentlemen,
as patient as he is wise,

100
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
and with the spirit of an angel.

101
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,125
There is no one better

102
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,416
from whom to seek
advice than he.

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,458
My, this tea is lovely!

104
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,666
[MAYA]
Here, here.

105
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,166
[KAE]
But all the same.

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,000
She is spending almost
every day in Kimito's room.

107
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,375
Is that not a
touch overfamiliar?

108
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,708
A few afternoons ago,

109
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,750
I went to pay him a
friendly visit at his room

110
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,625
and made it about
as far as the door.

111
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,208
But then I heard
the voice of that girl

112
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,208
enjoying herself so much,
it made me think twice

113
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,625
about going inside!

114
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,375
And I heard she's been
staying over there late as well!

115
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,125
[MIZUHO]
No!

116
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,458
[MAYA]
That cannot be!

117
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,416
[AIKA]
Here's the deal.

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,916
The party's gonna be kinda late,

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,166
so I intend to serve
some Commoner food!

120
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,541
Whatcha got for me?

121
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,875
[KIMITO] What if we just
put out a few cheap snacks?

122
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,750
Like some cheesy poofs.

123
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,208
Cheesy poofs? What?

124
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,041
[KIMITO] Yeah, they're
not half bad, actually.

125
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,833
You get 'em at
convenience stores.

126
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,166
Kinda stuff kids buy on
their way home from school.

127
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,000
Wow, that's awesome!

128
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,208
No, perfect!

129
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,458
"The Commoners'
After-School Shin-dig!"

130
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,666
Now how's that for an
awesome party title?

131
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,166
It sounds great.

132
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,250
I know!

133
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,291
[AIKA giggles]

134
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,791
This is gonna be fun!

135
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,041
I really do hope
everyone has a good time!

136
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,125
That's the whole point
of parties, right?

137
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,416
[MAYA]
Since you mentioned it,

138
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,958
from their exchange
in the classroom earlier,

139
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,166
I would say their connection
is frankly undeniable.

140
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,750
--[MAYA continues]
--[MIZUHO] Yes. Well. Anyway.

141
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,166
Would anyone care for more tea?

142
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,541
...the way he dropped
everything to chase after her

143
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,833
so suddenly like that!

144
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,958
What if it's not
just a friendship?

145
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,916
What if this advice
she so desperately sought

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
was actually not advice at all?

147
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,250
What if it was more?

148
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,500
What if they're boyfriend
and girlfriend now?

149
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,416
[MAYA] It's only the
two of them in his room.

150
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,625
All alone with no chaperone!

151
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,583
Wow. Does that mean they're...

152
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,375
You know, kissing?

153
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,958
That's enough from you, Kae!

154
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,041
[GIRLS gasp]

155
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,333
[KAE]
Oh, my. Reiko.

156
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,708
[REIKO crying]

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,791
[KAE crying]
You guys...

158
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,916
I was being so nice, and she...

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,583
I don't even know
what I did...

160
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,791
[KIMITO]
What's wrong?

161

[REIKO]
I am here.

166
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,875
[KIMITO]
Is everything okay?

167
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,416
[REIKO]
Please forgive me, Kimito,

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,875
but I cannot speak
about it with you.

169
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,666
[KIMITO]
I don't understand.

170
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
Did I do something wrong?

171

[REIKO gasps]

172
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,958
[REIKO] No, it's not
anything like that!

173
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,500
[KIMITO]
Uh... Sorry!

174
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,416
[REIKO]
So then.

175
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,625
I yelled at Kae and
stormed out of the room

176
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,583
without saying another
word on the subject.

177
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,166
This is a first for me.

178
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,708
You must believe that.

179
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,500
[REIKO]
What do I do now?

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,541
Don't worry.

181
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,208
I'll help you
get through this.

182
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,416
[AIKA]
Welcome back.

183
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,583
You're here?

184
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,166
Yeah, what's up with Reiko?

185
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,500
Will she be all right?

186
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,750
[AIKA]
I mean, you went to her room.

187
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,333
How'd you know about that?

188
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,625
I got curious when
I saw you take off.

189
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,333
So I followed you th--Ahh!

190
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,125
[KIMITO]
Too late.

191
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,416
Never mind how I
know about it, you butt!

192
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Did things go okay or not?

193
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,916
[KIMITO]
Well, she's pretty torn up.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,375
And you're gonna help her?

195
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,958
Bet you're thinkin' of a way
to cheer her up right now.

196
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,458
What makes you say that?

197
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,916
That's just the
kinda guy you are.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,125
You're nice.

199
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,791
So do you have
any bright ideas?

200
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,250
Well, Commoners get
into these kinda spats

201
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,333
all the time.

202
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
It's really not
that big a deal with us.

203
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,958
But things are
different at your school.

204
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,166
I doubt this'll
just work itself out.

205
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,291
We're gonna need
a grand gesture.

206
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,416
Some sort of gathering, maybe.

207
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,750
Ideally, the context
should be lighthearted.

208
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,916
If we can lift everyone's
spirits for a bit,

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,375
they'll see that this
really isn't all that bad.

210
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,708
We'll have to get
the entire class involved.

211
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,833
So the event needs
to have some draw.

212
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,041
And it's gotta scream,
"it's time to make up!"

213
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,958
If only there was something
that could accomplish all that.

214
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,250
There is, though.

215
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't play dumb
with me, you jerk?

216
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,125
My party supplies
are right there!

217
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:44,916
No way.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,166
I can't do that to you.

219
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,291
Look.

220
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,291
Your plan is better
than mine anyway,

221
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,166
so let's get it over with!

222
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,541
You really wanna do this?

223
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,875
Did I stutter, Commoner?

224
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,041
Okay.

225
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,166
You're a heck of a girl, Aika.

226
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,791
[AIKA]
You need to know, though.

227
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,583
This frickin' sucks.

228
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,041
Like a lot.

229
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,375
[AIKA] I'm the one who
came up with this plan

230
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,666
in the first place.

231
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,666
'Cause I want to be
a popular girl, too!

232
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,625
I'm tired of eating
lunch in bathroom stalls.

233
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,500
I want to have
friends like she does!

234
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,166
All of that crap is mine!

235
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,375
But it wouldn't be right
to let things stay like this.

236
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,458
It's not worth getting popular
if she has to take my place.

237
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,708
I want to have my party,

238

but not if it means
all this drama!

You're a heck of a girl, really.

You want me to get
some snacks ready?

and adopt some of
their behaviors.

A young lady
dressed up like this

There's nothing
for me to forgive!

00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,375
But, due to unavoidable
circumstances,

482
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,875
I think it's best
that I join.

483
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,208
I mean, why not?

484
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,916
I guess people must say
"strength in numbers"

485
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,625
for a reason. Right?

486
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,125
Now hold on just a minute!

487
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,708
Objection!
I vote "no" across the board!

488
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,958
Especially to the blonde bimbo!

489
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,375
Slow down, Aika.

490
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,458
I think if you relax for a sec
and stop freaking out,

491
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,708
you'll see she's tryin'
to meet you in the middle.

492
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,250
Well? Am I right or not?

493
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,375
If she really doesn't like it,

494
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,125
I suppose she
could always drop out.

495
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,416
[KIMITO]
Can't win 'em all.

496
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,583
[REIKO]
And another thing, Kimito.

497
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,208
[KIMITO]
Uh... Yes?

498
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,375
One small request. Please.

499
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,791
From now on, could you
call me your "boo"?

500
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,041
Okay, boo,

501
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
why don't you just throw
another lame tea party

502
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,416
with your stupid friends
and leave us alone?

503
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
Joining this club and
having tea with my friends

504
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,541
are not mutually exclusive.

505
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,625
I see no reason
why I can't do both.

506
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,333
[AIKA growls]
Wow.

507
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,625
You really do despise me,
don't you, Reiko?

508
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,750
Oh. My dear, dear Aika.

509
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,875
On the contrary,
I've never despised anyone

510
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,750
in all my years on this earth.

511
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,291
Why, nothing would
make me happier

512
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,208
than for us to be
on friendly terms.

513
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,666
[AIKA retches]

514
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,916
Although,
the exit is right here.

515
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,666
I'm not going anywhere!

516
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,000
This is strange.

517
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,208
Since when have those two
been so chummy?

518
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,041
[KIMITO]
Hakua!

519
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,875
Numbers. Important.

520
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,833
Maybe I should
record this just in case.

521
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,958
[KIMITO] Maybe you should point
that phone a little higher.

522
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,375
[REIKO]
Believe me when I tell you

523
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,583
I have no desire
to be your friend!

524
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,208
[AIKA] Believe me when
I tell you, "same-sies"!

525
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,375
[KIMITO]
Guys! Stop, will you?

526
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,416
[GIRLS arguing]

527
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,875
[REIKO]
Filthy cur!

528
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,000
[KIMITO]
What are those scissors for?

529
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,125
What are you planning to cut?

530
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,791
I don't see any ribbons
or paper around.

531
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,000
Just you, staring
at my lower half!

532
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:31,916
Don't know about you girls,

533
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,625
but these muscle vids
are my fav!

534
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,250
My dream is to become lubricant,

535
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,291
only to be applied to the firm,
rippling muscles

536
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,375
of a man!

537
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,208
Please forgive me
for doubting you.

538
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,708
Indeed, you are
a unique gentleman

539
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,291
who becomes sexually
aroused at the thought

540
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,541
of beads of sweat trickling
down the chiseled stomach

541
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,041
of a muscular man.

542
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,375
Muscle men?

543
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,500
Yaoi.

544
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,083
I can explain.

545
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,375
Don't look at me
like that, please!

546
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,250
Wait, why did you
only leave the apron on?

547
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,166
I feel envy.

548
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,291
I want to kill him.

549
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,500
Well in that case...

550
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,083
Perhaps I should strip as well.

551
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,916
Whatever, just get
these filthy jug-a-lugs

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,083
outta my face!

553
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,333
I like muscle men and girls

554
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,583
who look like
they're in grade school

555
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,916
'cause I'm a perv!
