1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,375
[PRESIDENT] I'm thrilled
to say that construction

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,625
on the new site
is finally complete!

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,791
So first thing tomorrow,

4
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,458
our students will be
taking a field trip!

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,958
Sounds like fun.
Where exactly are we going?

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,333
We have erected
a new theme park

7
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,541
in order to allow the ladies
to further experience

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,375
the particulars
of Commoner culture.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,833
It's called... Shominland.

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,208
[KIMITO]
Are you for real?

11
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,291
That's where you come in,
Mr. Kagurazaka!

12
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,291
While at Shominland,

13
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,375
we want you to
offer the students

14
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,041
all the guidance
and advice you can.

15
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,916
[KIMITO]
You sure that's a good idea?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,416
Ever since you
joined us here,

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
the atmosphere at school
has been much more cheerful.

18
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,875
Some of us were
worried your presence

19
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,958
might have a negative
influence on our students,

20
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,958
but it turns out
they were wrong.

21
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,666
Most boys have a tendency
to try and get girls riled up,

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,875
but not you.

23
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,833
Well... I'm glad I could help?

24
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:52,916
Then again, most boys aren't

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,708
Macho-man-loving perverts,
are they?

26
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm not a
macho-man-loving pervert!

27
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,041
[KUJO]
You'd better be one.

28
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,250
Because if you're not,

29
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,916
and you're here posing
as a sexual deviant,

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,083
then for the sake of the ladies,

31
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,291
I'll have to clip
your genitalia!

32
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,083
My dream is to live
life wedged between

33
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,500
two oiled glutes!

34
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,250
[KUJO]
In any case...

35
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,750
The opportunity has now come

36
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,458
for you to put your
Commoner know-how

37
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,083
to its greatest purpose yet.

38
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,916
You must demonstrate your
abilities and knowledge

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,375
to their fullest extent.

40
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,458
This is, perhaps,
the most significant moment

41
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,333
in your entire life to date.

42
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,083
[KIMITO]
No pressure though, right?

43
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,375
[REIKO] I am very
anxious and excited.

44
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:05,166
I cannot wait to see this
Shominland firsthand!

45
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,875
Yeah. Me too.

46
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,458
"One teriyaki burger
meal upsized.

47
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,375
With a large cola
to drink, please."

48
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,666
The wait is over!

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,666
It would appear they
are letting people inside!

50
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,750
[MAYA]
Shall we go then?

51
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,875
[REIKO]
Yes!

52
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,125
Time to rock, Aika. You ready?

53
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,541
Yeah...

54
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,750
[KIMITO] This is the opportunity
you've been waiting for!

55
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,625
The reason for everything you've
done in the Commoner Club.

56
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,000
This is your moment!

57
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,416
[AIKA whimpering]

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,125
[KIMITO] Just do like we
practiced, and you'll be fine.

59
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,208
Sound off!

60
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,416
[AIKA] I will exchange
phone numbers!

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,291
[KIMITO]
You got this!

62
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,541
[AIKA]
Of course I do!

63
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
[ANNOUNCER 6A]
Welcome to Shominland, ladies!

64
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,541
[STUDENTS cheering]

65
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,333
[ANNOUNCER 6A] This is a
one-of-a-kind theme park

66
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,791
designed to give you the
complete Commoner experience

67
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,291
in all its raw glory!

68
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,125
You're about to venture
into a foreign land

69
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,208
not of your own, so be safe
and have a good time out there!

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,125
[STUDENTS clapping]

71
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,416
[KIMITO]
Seriously?

72
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,625
[STUDENTS cheering]

73
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,833
[KIMITO] They ride up
on a fancy space elevator

74
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,166
and no one bats an eye.

75
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,125
Now they sound like
they're at a frickin' rave.

76
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,583
This place must be awesome.

77
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,208
Or not at all.

78
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
I bid you welcome
to Shominland:

79
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,291
A park modeled after
an average city block

80
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,791
in front of a train station.

81
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,875
[STUDENTS chattering]

82
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,250
Keep it together!

00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,500
Don't quit on me!

84
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,750
We made it this far,
we can't give up now.

85
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
Muster what courage you have!

86
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,375
[STUDENT 4A laughs]
A traffic signal!

87
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,791
[STUDENT 6A]
Look, it's a crosswalk!

88
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,666
[STUDENT 6B]
I've read about these,

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,500
but I've never seen one before!

90
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,708
[STUDENT 6C]
Let us cross it!

91
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,375
[STUDENT 4A]
We must look both ways first.

92
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
[STUDENT 6C]
Oh! Yes, of course!

00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,166
So, ya having a good time?

[AIKA]
Um...

00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,708
[KIMITO yells]

97
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,583
The heck was that for?!

98
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,958
It is custom to pass out
tissues at train stations.

99
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,708
[KIMITO] That's typically
done one at a time!

100
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,833
[KUJO]
They are silky-soft.

101
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,500
The best tissues money can buy.

102
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,333
They include a moisturizer to
prevent irritation of the skin.

103
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,583
No matter how many you use,

104
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,333
they shall bring you
naught but comfort.

105

[KIMITO]
Hello?!

106

Now...

00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,375
Allow me to direct you to
our first attraction, ladies.

108
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,666
[KUJO] This is, by far,
the most popular restaurant

109
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,416
amongst the Commoner populace.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,916
[CLERKS]
How can I help you today?

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,791
[STUDENTS]
Ahh!

112
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,041
At this restaurant.

113
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,958
Before eating, you must
first place your order

114
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,208
at that counter.

115
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,791
[REIKO]
My word! Are you in earnest?

116
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,083
[KUJO] There are detailed
menus on the countertops.

117
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,833
Look them over thoroughly and
give your order to the clerk.

118
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,583
This is certainly unusual.

119
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,083
But after we complete our order,
then we may sit at a table?

120
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,791
No. You must first
wait to collect your food.

121
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,875
[STUDENTS gasp]

122

Oh my...
Let me make sure I understand.

00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,250
We order... Then we stand there?

00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,458
[KUJO]
Yes.

125
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,625
Food preparation can
take quite a long time.

126
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,416
We might be standing
there waiting for our meal

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,166
for hours and hours on end.

128
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,666
Wait. Why must this be?

129
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,125
That's the way it is.

130
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,000
Here, customers must carry
their own food to the table.

131
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,583
It's commoner custom.

How truly incredible this is!

136
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,958
They're so independent!

137
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,291
Indeed.

138
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,833
It appears we have quite
a bit to learn from them!

139
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,250
It makes me painfully aware

140
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,750
of the immense privilege
I was afforded in my childhood.

I appreciate your patience, but
the wait won't be long at all.

This restaurant serves what
Commoner's call "fast food."

00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,708
[AIKA]
Sure!

482
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,750

483
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,041
[STUDENT 6V] Would it be all
right if I texted you, too?

484
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
[AIKA]
Of course!

485
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,291
[laughter continues]

486
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,958
[SAKIMORI]
What are you doing, Hakua?

487
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
Are you all right?

488
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,875
Don't get too cocky.

489
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,208
[KAREN gasps]
It's the ultimate humiliation!

490
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,000
Kimito's lips are soft,
and feel really great!

491
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,041
[REIKO]
Yes, it is better.

492
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,041
I despise you, Kimito!

493
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,541
Guess this is the end
of the Commoner Club.

494
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,791
It sure is fun
having lots of friends!
