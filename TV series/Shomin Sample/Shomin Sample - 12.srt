1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:11,916
[HOKO]
Reiko.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Uh, yes, ma'am?

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,916
Your marriage talks have
officially concluded.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,625
[gasps]

5
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,416
If you abandon me and the
rest of the Commoner Club,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,250
I don't know what I'll do!

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,375
[REIKO]
I want to stay at Seikain.

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,875
I wanna stay there with
Hakua, and with Karen.

9
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,750
And most of all, I want
to stay with you, Aika.

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:38,416
I'm so scared. Please,
I've no idea what to do.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,625
[AIKA] Don't worry.
We'll think of something.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,208
One way or another, we
will get you out of this.

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,000
[KIMITO]
It's all right.

14
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,208
This is a job for a Commoner.

15
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,083
We're out of the woods
now, for the most part.

16
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,666
Hey. Why'd you turn to us?

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm a member of
the Arisugawa family.

18
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,291
I can't very well be seen
to be against the engagement.

19
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,333
My sister's fate rests
entirely in your hands.

20
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,458
So, is this what a
real city looks like?

21
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,916
It resembles
Shominland remarkably.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,666
[KIMITO]
You've got that backwards.

23
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,083
[KIMITO]
What's the matter?

24
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,416
[MASAOMI]
See for yourself.

25
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,875
[KIMITO]
That's a lot of security.

26
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,583
[AIKA]
Lemme see, lemme see!

27
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,958
This is bad.

28
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,166
Somebody talked to my mother,

29
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,375
which means we have
a leak on the inside.

30
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,208
[AIKA]
Whoa! They have wooden swords!

31
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
What do we do now?

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,625
Here's the deal.

33
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,291
You charge in there
and create a diversion.

34
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,708
While the guards are distracted,

35
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll slip past them and
make my way inside the house.

36
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
No way! I'm not
chargin' in there!

37
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,875
[KAREN]
Aika's right.

38
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,375
Those men are wielding swords.

39
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,041
And from the looks of it,
they're quite handy with them.

40
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,000
It's time. My time.

41
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,750
The moment I've been waiting
for my whole life is here.

42
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,875
I will fight these swordsmen and
put my training to the test!

43
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,458
We have to get to Reiko.

44
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,083
And I'm guessing
the only way to do it

45
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,375
is through that front gate.

46
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,875
Yeah. That's right.

47
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:55,791
Karen, wait.

48
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,250
No. I'm done waiting.

49
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,791
This is my chance!

50
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,250
My name is Karen Jinyo!

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:12,000
I challenge all of you to a
fight to the death by sword.

52
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,291
Karen style sword art!
Resolution!

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,833
[GUARDS yell]

54
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,708
Oh no. Where're my compatriots?

55
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,833
That Kimito never was much
for sticking to the plan.

56
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,541
Regardless, today is the day
I show the world my quality.

57
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,458
Behold my new technique!
Karen style sword art!

58
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,166
Single Stretch!

00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,125
And we're in!

60
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,250
Wow! That was some straight
up superhero stuff!

61
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,208
We better go while we still can!

62
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,541
Oh no! We're surrounded!

63
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,291
Looks like it's
the end of the line.

64
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,333
There's too many, Kimito,
we don't stand a chance!

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,583
[KAREN] Continue the
mission. I'll handle them.

66
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,541
Right! My sister thanks you!

67
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,833
[KIMITO]
Be careful!

00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,833
Karen style sword art.

Not so fast, Master Masaomi.

71
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,041
Please, let us by!

72
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,666
You know I can't do that.

73
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,208
I recognize this must
be very hard on you.

74
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,208
But Master Masaomi, it's
time to let your sister go!

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,916
I will not!

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,333
What're you doing?

00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
[TAKEMIYA]
I see your resolve is strong.

79
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,750
But it's not strong enough.

and to the right.

Good work, Hakua.

00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041

Hold on, Kimito!

87
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,166
Slow down a bit!
I think I'm gonna puke!

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,000
How can you say that
at a time like this?

89

[AIKA]
Because I'm gonna puke!

90
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,083
First we had to deal with
guards. And now robots?

I can handle this one.

Where'd you learn
to throw like that?

don't'cha think?

Oh, crap!

control room's right here!

We're good.

Thanks a lot.

around like that for?

Yeah. Just past this room.

stop this thing?

get that outfit?

There's a room in this mansion.

from the outside world's.

stronger, my boy.

I assume you've come here

00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,250
So, I'm going to have to ask
you to leave right away.

163
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,916
Goodbye, sir. We
appreciate you stopping by.

164
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,750
Uh, Ma'am?

165
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,791
Yes?

166
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,333
I have something to say.

167
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,208
The thing is-- Ah!

168
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,666
I am against this marriage!

169
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,541
Fly you fool.

170
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,666
Is that so?

171
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,916
And so is your daughter!

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,416
My daughter is happy
to do her duty.

173
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,250
Isn't that right, love?
Tell your friend.

174
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,458
She is nervous.

175
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,416
But as a daughter of
the Arisugawa dynasty,

176
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,000
she knows exactly how
important this engagement is

177
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,416
to our family legacy.

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,666
This isn't what Reiko
wants and you know it!

179
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,708
She's only going along with
it because she's afraid!

180
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,750
It makes no difference
what the child wants.

[KIMITO gasps]

182
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,083
Family comes first.
Even before true love.

183
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,041
Reiko is fully aware that
this is a step she must take.

184
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,250
And that to marry into a great
family is a noble calling.

185
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,625
Her desires notwithstanding,

186
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,500
this is her sole
purpose in life.

187
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,291
I know this is confusing.

188
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,291
I wouldn't expect a mere
Commoner to understand.

[KIMITO]
You're right.

190
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,416
I've been at Seikain for
a little over a month,

191
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,708
and I still don't
understand your world.

192
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,958
Not even a bit.

193

Everything is different,

from the clothes you wear
to the food you eat.

195
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,458
I did my best to explain what
life is like for regular people,

196
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,750
but it doesn't get
through. Not really.

197
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,291
Honestly, I'm not sure we'll
ever understand each other.

198
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,291
But, even so.

199

...they are my best friends!

It's true.

203
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,500
So what if we do things
a little differently?

204
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,458
So what if we come
from different places?

205
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,666
We have had so much fun.

That's quite a story.

But Reiko's made her decision.
She's accepted her fate.

[gasps]

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,666
When I got to Seikain, I just
wanted people to like me.

217
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,166
And all I cared about
was being popular.

218
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,333
But now I realize just
how shallow that was.

219
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,083
I mean. Who cares how
many friends you have?

220
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,500
Life's not about
getting everyone

to think you're awesome.

It's about finding the
people you click with.

223
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,625
I learned that from Kimito.
From Karen. From Hakua.

224
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,000
But most of all, from Reiko!

225

I know it's not our place
to barge into your house

around the people she loves!

So sure of yourself.

the way things work.

Only young ladies from

are given the honor
of attending Seikain.

If you walk away from

00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,166
What do you mean, sir?

322
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,000
I am broke as a joke!
I'm a loser!

323
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,666
You seem confused.
Let me explain.

324
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,833
I've come to despise you in
the deepest part of my soul.

325
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,500
That is why I would
very much like you

326
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,666
to become my son-in-law.

327
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,083
Wait, that's not
how hate works.

328
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,000
You should avoid me.

329
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,833
No. That simply wouldn't do.

330
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,250
I'd love for you to
be a part of my life

331
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,791
so that I can torment you
with everything I can muster.

332
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,000
[squeals]

333
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,208
I do look forward
to it very much.

334
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,916
Welcome to the family, son.

335
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,375
[KIMITO] I don't want
her to be my mommy!

336
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,041
[AIKA]
Hold on a second, lady!

337
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,166
Objection!

338
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,333
We invoke our three fifths
majority in the Commoner Club

339
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,708
to veto this marriage!

340
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,250
That's right!

341
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,625
It's perfectly obvious that this
isn't what Kagurazaka wants!

342
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,833
Yeah!

343
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,916
But the matter is decided.

344
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,333
No, it's not!

345
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,416
You have got some nerve!

346
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,875
How dare you dodge
my sucker punch!

347
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,916
What am I supposed to do,

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,708
just stand there
and let you kill me?

349
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,250
I'm not gonna let you have her!

350
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,500
That's why I'm taking
you out, pervert!

351

[yelping]

352
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,416
[MASAOMI] Reiko's my
little sister, not yours!

353
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,583
I never said she was,
you big weirdo!

354

355
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,875
Time to die!

[KIMITO]
Reiko! Can't you stop him?

357

[REIKO]
"One hundred Fun Wedding Ideas."

358
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,916
I didn't know that
Commoner's had such

359
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,750
wonderfully
engrossing literature!

360
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,833
You have no cause to be
reading that, ya hear?

361
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,416
We should confiscate it.

362
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,208
[REIKO]
Ah!

363
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,750
Give that back or else!

364
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,750
Really? After everything I did
to stop you from leaving?

365
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,458
Obviously, I will come
visit you whenever I can!

366
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,291
I don't really care if I ever
see your treacherous face again.

367
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,500
[KIMITO] Your brother's
a friggin' psycho!

368
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,041
[TAKEMIYA] Masaomi,
please! Stop this at once!

369

[MASAOMI]
Takemiya!

370

[KIMITO screams]

371
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
[KIMITO]
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
What I said was
profoundly misleading.

373
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,791
There's no need for that.

374
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,833
Oblige me and lift up
your head, please.

375
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,250
It was my fault for
jumping to conclusions.

376
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,333
Both my mother and I could
not be any more embarrassed.

377
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,708
Do not feel bad at all.

378
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,208
[KIMITO] That's really nice,
but obviously, I do.

379
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,625
You mean a lot to me, Reiko.
I never meant to hurt you.

380
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,250
You're supposed to call
me "Rei"' now, remember?

381
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,875
Oh. I forgot.
I'm so sorry, Rei.

382
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,916
I led you down the
wrong path back there.

383
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,041
It's my fault, do you hear me?

384
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,833
Yeah. Sure.

385
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,125

All right, you two,

387
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,333
what're you doing
in here by yourselves?

388
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,208
What? There's
nothing wrong with it.

389
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,583
[AIKA] Uh, yeah there is,
it's Club time!

390
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,291
Though this meeting
is beneath the dignity

391
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,916
of a master Samurai,
I shall attend it.

392
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,083
That's right. I forgot.

393
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,958
I wanted to ask you about
something you said to me

394
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,333
back at my estate.

395
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,625
If I had run away from home,
were you actually going

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,208
to let me live with you?

397
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,291
Of course.

398
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,125
Maybe I will run away then.

399
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,500
[AIKA]
What?!

400
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,791
Seriously, after everything
we just went through?

401
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,958
Well, I'm afraid it's none
of your business, Aika!

402
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,083
Of course it's my
business, you freak!

403
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,750
Or did you forget
we saved your butt?

404
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,291
If I were you, I would cease
this line of conversation!

Where in the world
are you, Kimito?!

[PRESIDENT] Well, no matter
which way you look at it,

But how are we going
to deal with him?

00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,916
I've an idea.

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,125
His tongue was the culprit, so
why don't we have it removed.

418
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,916
Oh, my. Perhaps
that is a bit harsh.

Please believe me,
I really am sorry!

Well, you know how
these things always go.

421
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,416
I suppose we'll have
to suffer through it
