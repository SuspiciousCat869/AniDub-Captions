00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare worry me
like that again, okay?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's all?

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
So that was you.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
That was your atrocious
fighting I saw?

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
Hold up, atrocious?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
[SECOND]
Knight!

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
We only just met them, try not
to be rude right off the bat.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you two?

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you!
We're the Gridknight Alliance.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
[SECOND] Uh, the name's
not super important, though.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
What the hell?

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
All that matters, is that we're
people who work to protect

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
the world from the
threat of kaiju!

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
You protect the
world from kaiju?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
Okay then, so how's the
giant purple guy involved?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
I am the purple guy.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
--[CHISE, KOYOMI] Hm?
--[YOMOGI] Huh?

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
You become that thing?

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
Like you transform into it?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Now that's some
fantasy level stuff.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] Originally, I thought
that red guy was a kaiju,

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
but I guess not.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
Your ragtag crew ended
up getting wrecked.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Are you talking about Dynazenon?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] Dynazenon?
Is that its name?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] So? Did you really
come here to fight kaiju?

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
[SECOND]
We did! Believe it or not,

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
we actually would like to
cooperate with you guys.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Cooperate?

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
[SECOND]
Yup! And speaking of which...

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
[SECOND gasps]
...we can use this!

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
--It's a Fixer B--
--[GAUMA] We refuse!

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there's no way.
These guys are shady as hell.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
We can't just trust
random people

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
who roll up out of nowhere.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
But <i>you</i> rolled up
out of nowhere.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter, I'd rather not
work with the wounded, anyway.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
You'd probably hold me back.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
I am merely stating the truth.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
Hey, pal, what is up with you?

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
You wanna cooperate with us, or
do you just wanna pick a fight?

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
Uh, maybe this is a bad time.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Knight,
we should probably go.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
For now.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Right.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
Man, what is their deal?

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
They should get on the
same page next time.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
Was that smart idea, Gauma?

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
Dynazenon's broken, remember?

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we fight together?

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA grunts]

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Dynazenon, huh?

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
Whenever kaiju appear,

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
it's inevitable that
opposition will, too.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
Like antibodies that rise to
defend the world from invaders.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
[SECOND]
Yes. But if you want my opinion,

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
it seems pretty obvious
that they're not bad people.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] Even so,
I'd like to make sure of it.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
I knew it.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
It doesn't heal with time,
after all.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA grunts]

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gauma?

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Hm?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
About earlier.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
The reason I left was
to save someone.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
A guy. I think I
kind of hate him.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
I understand, but good on you.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
A long time ago,
somebody told me something.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
They said, "It's best to live
honestly with your feelings."

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
This person.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Was it the same one
you're searching for?

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Yeah.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
What kind of person was she?

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] She was someone
who lived in a world

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't possibly reach.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
And...

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
And?

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
A total beauty.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
I see.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
And she's the one who
entrusted Dynazenon to you.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
It's cool, right?

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Hm... Sure is.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
So, hey. What will
Gauma do next?

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
It's not like we can
fight a kaiju like this.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
You always carry
that around, huh?

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
Are you hot?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
Maybe, uh, I'll buy something.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
This thing.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
It was Kano's.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Back then, I always
wanted to play with it.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
[YUME whimpers]

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
Kano. Can I please try it, too?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
No way, you're never
getting it.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
When Kano...

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
[YUME sighs]
When she and I were little,

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
I feel like we got
along just fine.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
But before long,
we began to grow apart.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
Even at home, I hardly
saw her smile.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
So when I saw her
smiling in that video,

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
to see her joking around and
having fun in chorus club...

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
I guess... it surprised me.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
But... the day she invited me to
come to her chorus club recital,

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
she was smiling.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
but I thought... maybe she
wanted to get along again.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
The way we used to, in the past.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
I was hopeful.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
But that was the last time....
I ever saw her.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
If Kano really was bullied,

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
and if it really was suicide.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
I wonder why she smiled
at me that day?

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
What was she thinking?

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
Because... I truly,
honestly, have no idea.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
I guess... I don't know
anything about Kano.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI sniffs]

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
[YUME gasps]

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI sobs]

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Huh?

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI inhales]
Sorry.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Uh, why are you crying?

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
I don't know.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
I really don't know.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
It's just...

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
You still don't know whether it
was a suicide or not, you know?

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
A-A-And you still don't know
why she was smiling, either.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
S-So, let's keep
investigating more.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
Okay, but Kano is just
a stranger to you.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
She was your sister, Minami.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
And since she was
a part of you, I--

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
She's not some stranger.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
[YUME giggles]

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Hm? What's up?

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
[YUME chuckles]
Just your face.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Sorry.

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
Wow, Yomogi,
talk about a runny nose.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI chuckles]
I know. It's a snotty mess, huh?

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
Yomogi?

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what is it?

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Thank you.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Wait here.
I'll get us some ice cream.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
[YUME grunts]
Hold on, I'll come, too.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
[sighs, gasps]

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
You doin' okay, Mujina,
or do you need a break?

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
I'm alright.
I don't tire easily.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
Not when connected to kaiju.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
After all, real kaiju
users don't require sleep.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Hey, wake up.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[KAIJU A roars]

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
It's the kaiju.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Dynazenon's not in good shape,
but we've got no choice.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center

Dynazenon!

Yo, Dynazenon!

This time, we're gonna crush
your ragtag ass for sure!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
