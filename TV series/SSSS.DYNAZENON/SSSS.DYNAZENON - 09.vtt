you know.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is true.

[GAUMA]
I realized something today.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
No matter what, we've all
gotta fight together.

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
We can't win without
everyone here.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
Does that include me?

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
You... and Goldburn.

[YUME] Looks like we're too
late for the festival.

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
No, not if we run.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Let's go, team!

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Right now?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
C'mon, get moving!

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
That includes you.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
Huh, guess we
didn't make it.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
Well, that sucks.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
Hey. Let's get some fireworks.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
--Want to?
--Huh?

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
We can do our own, right?

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
What a great idea!

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Knight,
let's go buy some!

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Huh...? Right.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna go and
buy even more fireworks!

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Right.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
Is it cool if I run
home for a second?

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
Uh, what for?

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.754 position:50% align:center
You'll see. I'll be right back.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.515 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Minami's taking forever.

00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:30.642 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's been
gone for a while.

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:32.477 position:50% align:center
She's late again, eh?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.562 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Yeah. I'll go get her.

00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:48.827 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'm here now.
