[ALL grunt]

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.894 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA] 
We lost the fight.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
We were defeated
by Dynazenon again.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
I see.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
It was the ideal kaiju that
could destroy time and space.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
With all the people
being touched

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
by their past and future,
it should have spawned

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.370 position:50% align:center
more human emotions
than ever before.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50% align:center
However...

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.374 position:50% align:center
No kaiju are appearing now.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
Which means all the kaiju seeds
must have been wiped out.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.132 position:50% align:center
Then, you're saying that kaiju
won't be born anymore?

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.884 position:50% align:center
We were beaten in
the truest sense.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.013 position:50% align:center
We really lost to Gauma?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, their weapon
isn't from this era.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center
It would have had to come
from 5,000 years ago.

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
If there aren't any more kaiju,

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
then I'll just have to
slaughter people myself.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
It's not over. There has
to be something left

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.779 position:50% align:center
that we can still do
for the world of kaiju,

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.366 position:50% align:center
and for all of the kaiju
who have fallen thus far.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] I wonder, when kaiju
users lose their kaiju,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
do they go back to
being merely human?

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
Like how Gauma is now.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center

[CHISE]
So, hey, what are you doing?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.721 position:50% align:center
I'm making a resume.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
I wonder if I need a suit?

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Huh, where'd it go?

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Hey, Mom!
Have you seen my suit?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Here, my mom
wanted you to have this.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Hm? What is it?

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Crab crisps. Oh, from Toyosu.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
They've gotta taste way better
than those live river crabs.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Ah, whatever! Jeez.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
Get moving or the two
of you'll be late.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
Ugh... I feel like total shit.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with me?

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[MEI] You apologized
to the second year?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
It was overdue.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
What are you doing?

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
I'm picking out an
entry for the festival.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah?

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
Do you think I can use a
picture with you in it?

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
That's gonna be a no.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
[AWAKI]
So Sizumu isn't coming anymore?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
I guess not.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's got some
family issues.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center

He wasn't even that friendly.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center

I look so weird in this thing.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center

[GOLDBURN roars]

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center

Hey there, are you alright?

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm just thinking.
But why are you two here?

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
--For Goldburn.
--[CHISE] Hm?

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
You see, our time here is done
and we'll have to leave soon.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
Seems kinda sudden.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
Kaiju will no longer
appear in this world.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
Goldburn and the two of us.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
We're what you would
call irregulars.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
So we're planning on taking
Goldburn with us when we leave.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
Because it's more
natural that way.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
Your world doesn't need us.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Hm?

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Prepare your heart, Chise.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's not like
I don't understand

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
that's how things need to be.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
Deep down, I do know it.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
But it's not fair!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Gauma seems kinda
out of it lately, huh?

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Without his spunk,
he's sort of boring.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Right?

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Worried about him?

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh, not really.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
I think you are.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,

eventually come, but still...

It's hard, you know?

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
You're both... gonna leave me.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you want?

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
You here to fight?
If so, bring it on.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
No. It's not that.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
Kaiju won't appear here anymore.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
I came to tell you--

[JUUGA groans]

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
You've got some nerve!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
Saying that doesn't
change anything!

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
What you've done...
Do you even know?

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
Do any of you actually care?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
Fine, then!
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Gauma, stop,
what are you doing?

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA, YOMOGI grunting]

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Cut it out!

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
This isn't the answer!

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
Go away! And never show
your face here again!

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
That was my plan.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
Some things never change.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
Your punches are still as
sad as ever. Pathetic.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Wait, kaiju won't
appear anymore?

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
Is that why you've been
feeling so down?

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Down, huh? Didn't realize
it was so obvious.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Yeah, you've seemed
a little out of it.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI groans]

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] When I revived...
I thought Princess would, too.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
That she was here,
somewhere in the world.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
Princess?

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
So, the person you've been
looking for this whole time

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
is actually a princess?

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And we both made a vow
to spend our futures together.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
That's why... after I died...

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
...Princess ended her own life.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
But, Gauma, how could
you possibly know

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
what happened after
you died, though?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
I heard someone say it.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A] Princess died so
she could meet you again!

00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
She wanted it so badly that
she followed you into death!

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Then she said
Princess left this for me.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
Do you know whose
voice it was?

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
No, I can't remember.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50% align:center
But... princess had
a premonition.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
She must have known.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
That one day, I was going
to need Dynazenon.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Except... only the
kaiju users were revived.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
And not Princess.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Does that mean you
won't get to meet her?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Who knows?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad I came
to this place.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.973 position:50% align:center
The scenery is very similar.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] By the way, I doubt
we'll need Dynazenon anymore.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
I had Koyomi return his.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Are you going away somewhere?

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
I am thinking about it.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI grunts]

00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Oh... Just looking at it.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
I realize he's
actually kinda cool.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
Man, I look terrible.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI gasps]
Whoa! It's you!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA] Koyomi, I thought I
would come and tell you myself.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Mm.. Uh...

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
It's done. There probably
won't be any more kaiju.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
Uh yeah, I heard.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
I see. So, you know there's
no more fighting, then.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.
But what can I say?

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
Should I be happy?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
Everything's different.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
Kaiju have changed me.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
Nothing will ever
be the same again.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
So, do you hate me, then?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] No. You were
just doing your job.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
Or whatever it is you
were meant to do.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless,
I hate you, Koyomi.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Mm? Hey, look.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
What's that? A mummy?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Yeah, it's a 5,000
year old one that went missing.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
Whoa, so the mummy supposedly
came to life and vanished? Huh.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess. I think
it might be Gauma.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
The mummy? Freaky.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I wonder how
he came back to life.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
A kaiju's power?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Maybe.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
And the princess
wasn't a kaiju user,

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
so that's why she didn't revive.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
Because of that
they'll never meet.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
It certainly explains
why Gauma is depressed.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow. Can you go
somewhere with me?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA groans]

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
[MALE TV VOICE A]
Okay, let's see how our next 

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
contestant does!
What's your guess?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, I'm planning
on going somewhere.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Kano's grave.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
That seems rather sudden.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it is.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
When are you going there?

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[YUME gasps]

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
Do you need a ride?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I'll be
fine on my own.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
What?

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
But I already told you that
we're supposed to eat out

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
with Kamijo tomorrow.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
We even planned it around
your work schedule!

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
I know. Sorry.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
Sorry doesn't cut it.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you can eat out
whenever you feel like it,

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
so I don't know why you're
making such a huge fuss.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM groans]

[YOMOGI'S MOM sighs]

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
Wonder what my strengths are.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[GOLDBURN roars]

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that we're
in his debt, Knight.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
So thank him for all he's
done for us, got it?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA groans]

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
Well, we're going
to be leaving soon.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
And we wanted to
tell you goodbye.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
Is that so?
I appreciate all your help.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
You guys be safe.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
What'd I tell you?

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Thank you for everything.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
Hey, c'mon, you need
to speak louder.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
Flowers facing this way?

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, I've never
visited Kano until right now.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I... kept avoiding it.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
My mom was a bit surprised,

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
but my dad actually seemed
happy I was coming.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
To be honest, my parents
drive me nuts.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
You don't have
that problem, do you?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, the thing is...

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Huh?

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] A dude I don't know
might become my new dad.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Ah.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
Oh! But he seems
decent enough.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Guess we both have
it rough, huh?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
[YUME] I know what to do,
I'll tell my ancestors that

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
my parents do nothing
but fight all the time.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI chuckles]
Seriously?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
Got you!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I've never visited
someone else's grave.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
This is a first.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
I thought if anyone
would understand,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
it would be you, Yomogi.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center

I'll go return these.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center

[RANKA]
What is?

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Some random dude totally
punched a police officer

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
then took off with his gun.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
Well, he'll get arrested.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
Whoa, he looks kinda crazy.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
[RANKA, NAZUMI]
So awesome!

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Man, it looks bad over there.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
[YUME] It's where the
first kaiju appeared.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Do you remember the
time when you took me there?

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
[YUME giggles]
Yep.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] They sort of appeared
all over the place, huh?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
[YUME] We may have been
beating up kaiju and stuff,

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
but fighting with Dynazenon

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
was the closest thing
I've ever had to normal.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Normal? How is that normal?

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Okay, the piloting
a robot part wasn't normal.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
But visiting graves,
going swimming,

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
missing the festival and
doing fireworks was.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI chuckles]
I guess.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
If there aren't any more kaiju

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
and we're done with Dynazenon,

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
does that mean we'll
stop seeing everyone?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
Will all of those normal
things also disappear?

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
Perhaps deep down,

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
it's possible you two
just want to fight them.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[YUME] What if when Sizumu
said those things,

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
he actually was right?

Even if there're
no more kaiju...

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
Even if there's no Dynazenon...

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.
I still wanna see you.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
I like you.

Will you date me?

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
Well, it appears it
was the right call

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
to hang around the two of you.

--[YOMOGI gasps]
--[YUME] Sizumu?

So Gauma died
as a kaiju user

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
and then revived
as a mere human.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center

like you two now.

Hold on. What do you
think you're doing?

show up sooner or later.

for a while, haven't you?

I'm grateful to you two.

You helped me witness
some wonderful emotions.

Thank you.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Gauma, your body!

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] We revived
with the power of kaiju,

defying the laws of this world.

But since you're human now,

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
your body will quickly
decay and you'll die.

[SIZUMU] The rest of us are
connected to the kaiju,

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
so we're exempt.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Heh. That's probably
something you should have

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
told me from the start.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
Yes, but if I had,

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
would you still have
become a kaiju user?

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center

with stupid questions.

lose all the kaiju!

It looks like Knight
