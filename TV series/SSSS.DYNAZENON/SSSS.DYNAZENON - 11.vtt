00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
Nothing will ever
be the same again.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
So, do you hate me, then?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] No. You were
just doing your job.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
Or whatever it is you
were meant to do.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless,
I hate you, Koyomi.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Mm? Hey, look.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
What's that? A mummy?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Yeah, it's a 5,000
year old one that went missing.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
Whoa, so the mummy supposedly
came to life and vanished? Huh.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess. I think
it might be Gauma.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
The mummy? Freaky.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I wonder how
he came back to life.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
A kaiju's power?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Maybe.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
And the princess
wasn't a kaiju user,

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
so that's why she didn't revive.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
Because of that
they'll never meet.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
It certainly explains
why Gauma is depressed.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow. Can you go
somewhere with me?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA groans]

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
[MALE TV VOICE A]
Okay, let's see how our next 

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
contestant does!
What's your guess?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, I'm planning
on going somewhere.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Kano's grave.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
That seems rather sudden.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it is.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
When are you going there?

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[YUME gasps]

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
Do you need a ride?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I'll be
fine on my own.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
What?

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
But I already told you that
we're supposed to eat out

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
with Kamijo tomorrow.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
We even planned it around
your work schedule!

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
I know. Sorry.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
Sorry doesn't cut it.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you can eat out
whenever you feel like it,

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
so I don't know why you're
making such a huge fuss.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM groans]

[YOMOGI'S MOM sighs]

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
Wonder what my strengths are.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[GOLDBURN roars]

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that we're
in his debt, Knight.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
So thank him for all he's
done for us, got it?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA groans]

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
Well, we're going
to be leaving soon.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
And we wanted to
tell you goodbye.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
Is that so?
I appreciate all your help.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
You guys be safe.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
What'd I tell you?

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Thank you for everything.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
Hey, c'mon, you need
to speak louder.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
Flowers facing this way?

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, I've never
visited Kano until right now.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I... kept avoiding it.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
My mom was a bit surprised,

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
but my dad actually seemed
happy I was coming.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
To be honest, my parents
drive me nuts.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
You don't have
that problem, do you?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, the thing is...

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Huh?

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] A dude I don't know
might become my new dad.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Ah.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
Oh! But he seems
decent enough.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Guess we both have
it rough, huh?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
[YUME] I know what to do,
I'll tell my ancestors that

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
my parents do nothing
but fight all the time.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI chuckles]
Seriously?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
Got you!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I've never visited
someone else's grave.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
This is a first.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
I thought if anyone
would understand,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
it would be you, Yomogi.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center

I'll go return these.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center

[RANKA]
What is?

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Some random dude totally
punched a police officer

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
then took off with his gun.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
Well, he'll get arrested.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
Whoa, he looks kinda crazy.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
[RANKA, NAZUMI]
So awesome!

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Man, it looks bad over there.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
[YUME] It's where the
first kaiju appeared.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Do you remember the
time when you took me there?

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
[YUME giggles]
Yep.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] They sort of appeared
all over the place, huh?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
[YUME] We may have been
beating up kaiju and stuff,

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
but fighting with Dynazenon

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
was the closest thing
I've ever had to normal.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Normal? How is that normal?

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Okay, the piloting
a robot part wasn't normal.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
But visiting graves,
going swimming,

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
missing the festival and
doing fireworks was.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI chuckles]
I guess.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
If there aren't any more kaiju

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
and we're done with Dynazenon,

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
does that mean we'll
stop seeing everyone?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
Will all of those normal
things also disappear?

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
Perhaps deep down,

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
it's possible you two
just want to fight them.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[YUME] What if when Sizumu
said those things,

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
he actually was right?

Even if there're
no more kaiju...

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
Even if there's no Dynazenon...

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.
I still wanna see you.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
I like you.

Will you date me?

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
Well, it appears it
was the right call

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
to hang around the two of you.

--[YOMOGI gasps]
--[YUME] Sizumu?

So Gauma died
as a kaiju user

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
and then revived
as a mere human.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center

like you two now.

Hold on. What do you
think you're doing?

show up sooner or later.

for a while, haven't you?

I'm grateful to you two.

You helped me witness
some wonderful emotions.

Thank you.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Gauma, your body!

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] We revived
with the power of kaiju,

defying the laws of this world.

But since you're human now,

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
your body will quickly
decay and you'll die.

[SIZUMU] The rest of us are
connected to the kaiju,

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
so we're exempt.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Heh. That's probably
something you should have

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
told me from the start.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
Yes, but if I had,

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
would you still have
become a kaiju user?

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center

with stupid questions.

lose all the kaiju!
