[GAUMA] I see. It can
go back to being small.

Listen, if it weren't
for you guys, 

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
then I would have never
beat that kaiju, y'know?

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:30.294 position:50% align:center
Huh? But I didn't do
anything back there.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.421 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Well... it's only a hunch,

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.298 position:50% align:center
but it's quite possible
that Dynazenon

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.133 position:50% align:center
--recognized your aptitude.

Oh. Chise.

What happened to the robot?

Is it gone now?

Huh? Wait, it can shrink?

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.855 position:50% align:center
Hell no.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.983 position:50% align:center
You'd better to apologize
to Yomogi right now!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Like, what the hell?

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
You were totally
gonna ditch the guy!

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
So that's why...

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:01.283 position:50% align:center
...you should apologize for
breaking your promise to Yomogi!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
Look, let's forget it, okay?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.328 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Why should I?

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
Because... I just don't think
it's important right now.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.044 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] So, uh.
What are we talking about?

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.296 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Huh? Who are you?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.924 position:50% align:center
I'm Koyomi. Yamanaka.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
And I'm Chise Asukagawa.
The two of us are cousins.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:24.223 position:50% align:center
Alright, I'm Gauma.
Now it's your turn.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.183 position:50% align:center
You got a name?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I'm Yume... Minami.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.314 position:50% align:center
Just chill out, 'kay?

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.358 position:50% align:center
Anyway, about the Kaiju.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.319 position:50% align:center
What's going on with
it and Dynazenon?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.197 position:50% align:center
Well, that kaiju was
definitely being controlled.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.657 position:50% align:center
My guess?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
It was the Kaiju Eugenicists,
a dangerous crew.

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:47.204 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Kaiju Eugenicists?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.914 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
How do you know them?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] They're a group
of kaiju users like me,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure they'll be back.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.212 position:50% align:center
You mean there's
gonna be more kaiju?

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.089 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] To get ready
for when they come,

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
you guys need to start doing
Dynazenon training right away.

00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
Let's meet up here
tomorrow and get to it.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Wh--Hold up.
Tomorrow, tomorrow?

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.103 position:50% align:center
Are you guys okay with this?

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.856 position:50% align:center
If everyone else comes,
too, then sure.

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
And you, especially.
I want you to promise.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.111 position:50% align:center
Promise you'll show up.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.946 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll be there.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.581 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Dynazenon.
Are you really a kaiju?

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]  I wonder why "that"
person trusted you with me.

you're being tricked!

with you the whole time!

those things is the kaiju?

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center

Listen up, everyone!

So, uh, thanks to the kaiju
incident yesterday,

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
the transportation system
is a gigantic mess.

this evening, right?

Is it okay if I
tag along with you?

I guess.

Man. It must be super nice
to get your very own robot!

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.899 position:50% align:center
Hey, weird question, but you
get paid for this, right?

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.943 position:50% align:center
Huh? You think we will?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Maybe. What if you did?

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:46.240 position:50% align:center
Uh. Then that would mean that...

I should've gone to training.

last night? Amazing?

pilot training!

Stand out much?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.060 position:50% align:center

Like right now?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.688 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] We could use
your toys to get there.

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.786 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] It's only a hunch,
but it's quite possible

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
that Dynazenon
recognized your aptitude.

[GAUMA] Didn't know you
were in here, sorry.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.503 position:50% align:center
Gauma? What are you
doing in my bathroom?

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.629 position:50% align:center
Because you weren't at training.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
Whatever, can you
just close the door?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.632 position:50% align:center
Sure. No problem.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.509 position:50% align:center
Why are you coming in here?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:17.224 position:50% align:center
Yomogi. Tell me why you didn't
come to training earlier.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you really come to my
house just to interrogate me?

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:24.231 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I had to go to work.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.984 position:50% align:center
Work is more important
than training?

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm finally old enough
to earn my own money.

00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.406 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:35.284 position:50% align:center
Don't you feel cramped?

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center

[YOMOGI] I'm... just along
for the ride, right?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.853 position:50% align:center
[ALL shout]

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.944 position:50% align:center
It's no use! I can't figure
out this thing's movements!

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
Split up and fight!

00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:52.656 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI] Split up?
--[GAUMA] Disperse!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Wait, uh...

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Got it? Fight it as three.

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:02.708 position:50% align:center
At least until I can
get a good shot.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.127 position:50% align:center
Uh. So...

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.962 position:50% align:center
...I hate to bring this up
but I don't really know how

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
to move yet.

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
C'mon, Yomogi! Move!

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:23.187 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!
I'm not sure how yet!

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.438 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[phone ringing]

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
Crap. My work is
trying to call me.

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.610 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Quick slacking off, Yomogi!

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.320 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] It's not like
I'm trying to be useless 

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.613 position:50% align:center
on purpose!

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.911 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
I caught it!

00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
It's gone.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:46.293 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
Damn! And it's all my fault!

00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
Yomogi. I think it's the wings.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Its wings?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.347 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Right before it warps,
it spreads its wings.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.225 position:50% align:center
In that case, do you think
it wouldn't be able to warp

00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
if I held it in place?

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.646 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yomogi.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
Hey, let's you and I try
working together this time.

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:10.359 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
What do you mean?

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.194 position:50% align:center
[YUME] The thing we did before.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Let's go.

00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Mm.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
[YUME, YOMOGI]
Dyna Soldier Wing Combine!

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea?

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
Who cares if your form changed?

00:19:58.574 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
I can protect something,
so I will!

00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:07.958 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Gotcha!

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Okay, hold tight, Yomogi!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.588 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI shouts]

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.843 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Do it now!

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.972 position:50% align:center
Toss it, Yomogi!

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Dyna Launcher!

00:20:29.146 --> 00:20:32.191 position:50% align:center
Burst Missile!

00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:50.876 position:50% align:center
Looks like the big guy and
the others won again! Hooray!

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:55.923 position:50% align:center
We won...

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:01.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we did. We won
this one big time.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
That was some pretty
sweet teamwork, you three.

00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
Way to go, guys.

00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Aren't you glad?

00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Hm?

00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:23.492 position:50% align:center
We protected it.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I held
everyone back today.

00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Maybe.

00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I had a big sister.

00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
She died when I was young.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Hey, Minami.

00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:44.263 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] About your big sister.
Did you like her?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Hm... Back then, no.

00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
But now I'm not
so sure anymore.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
I never thought we'd reunite

00:21:57.234 --> 00:21:59.945 position:50% align:center
here of all places, Gauma.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I knew it had to be you guys!

00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:07.578 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Mm?

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me,
are those people...?

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:14.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They're the
Kaiju Eugenicists.

00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:16.879 position:50% align:center
They're all kaiju users like me.
