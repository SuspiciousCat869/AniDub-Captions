Warping?!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I'm... just along
for the ride, right?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.853 position:50% align:center
[ALL shout]

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.944 position:50% align:center
It's no use! I can't figure
out this thing's movements!

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
Split up and fight!

00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:52.656 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI] Split up?
--[GAUMA] Disperse!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Wait, uh...

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Got it? Fight it as three.

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:02.708 position:50% align:center
At least until I can
get a good shot.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.127 position:50% align:center
Uh. So...

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.962 position:50% align:center
...I hate to bring this up
but I don't really know how

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
to move yet.

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
C'mon, Yomogi! Move!

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:23.187 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!
I'm not sure how yet!

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.438 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[phone ringing]

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
Crap. My work is
trying to call me.

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.610 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Quick slacking off, Yomogi!

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.320 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] It's not like
I'm trying to be useless 

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.613 position:50% align:center
on purpose!

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.911 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
I caught it!

00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
It's gone.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:46.293 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
Damn! And it's all my fault!

00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
Yomogi. I think it's the wings.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Its wings?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.347 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Right before it warps,
it spreads its wings.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.225 position:50% align:center
In that case, do you think
it wouldn't be able to warp

00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
if I held it in place?

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.646 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yomogi.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
Hey, let's you and I try
working together this time.

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:10.359 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
What do you mean?

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.194 position:50% align:center
[YUME] The thing we did before.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Let's go.

00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Mm.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
[YUME, YOMOGI]
Dyna Soldier Wing Combine!

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea?

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
Who cares if your form changed?

00:19:58.574 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
I can protect something,
so I will!

00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:07.958 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Gotcha!

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Okay, hold tight, Yomogi!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.588 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI shouts]

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
What?

[grunts]

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Do it now!

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.972 position:50% align:center
Toss it, Yomogi!

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Dyna Launcher!

Looks like the big guy and
the others won again! Hooray!

We won...

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:01.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we did. We won
this one big time.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
That was some pretty
sweet teamwork, you three.

00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
Way to go, guys.

Aren't you glad?

[YOMOGI]
Hm?

00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:23.492 position:50% align:center
We protected it.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I held
everyone back today.

00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Maybe.

00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I had a big sister.

00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
She died when I was young.

[YOMOGI]
Hey, Minami.

00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:44.263 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] About your big sister.
Did you like her?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Hm... Back then, no.

00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
But now I'm not
so sure anymore.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
I never thought we'd reunite

00:21:57.234 --> 00:21:59.945 position:50% align:center
here of all places, Gauma.

I knew it had to be you guys!

00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:07.578 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Mm?

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me,
are those people...?

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:14.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They're the
Kaiju Eugenicists.
