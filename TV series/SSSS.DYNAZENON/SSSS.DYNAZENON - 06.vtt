â™ª

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Suicide?

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.976 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA] Maybe? Like I said,
it's just a rumor.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
Just a rumor.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA] Kano was cheerful
and everyone loved her,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
even the upperclassmen,

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:50.110 position:50% align:center
but over time that attitude
slowly started to change.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
Did something happen?

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say for sure, but I
think it was because of Futaba.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.701 position:50% align:center
Futaba?

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA]
Yeah. Uh. Didn't Kano tell you?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.123 position:50% align:center
No, I've never heard of him.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.290 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA]
I see.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Well, we didn't
really talk about

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
those kinds of things.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA] Futaba Senda was
the club's vice president.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
He had a way with people.
Dude was a real charmer.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA] I think a lot
of the girls in the club

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
had a crush on him.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
Naturally, it wasn't that
long until he and Kano

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
became something of an item.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Hold up a sec.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that my sister
was going out with this guy,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
like they were dating?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA]
Yeah.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
And at the time, Futaba really
was pushing the song Kano

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.196 position:50% align:center
had picked out to
use for the recital.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
After that, the other
girls got involved.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
It started with
playful teasing, but then...

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
[YUME] You mean they
started bullying her?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
Uh, I honestly don't know if
it was legit bullying or not,

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
but looking back on it,
it felt like there might've been

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
something else there,
you know?

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, in the
video Urita showed us,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
it didn't feel that way.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
Looked like it was fine.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
[YUME sighs]

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
There are other videos
that are out there

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
besides just the
unlisted ones, though.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
[FUUMA]
Some are them are private.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
They made them that
way after the accident.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
Show me! I need to see.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
Alright. That's okay.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
I can share them all with
your account in a little bit.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I appreciate it.

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Sorry for dragging
you around so much.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Nah.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm the one who asked
you to tag along, remember?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thank you.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
What's up?

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
It just feels like...
I'm so clueless.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
Like I never knew Kano at all.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
You think that's what happened?

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
What are you going to do now?

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
Well, if it's true that she
really didn't die by accident,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
then... I guess...
I wanna find out why.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Yeah, except if it was bullying,
then there won't be any proof.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
That's why it's called bullying.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
If you do dig deeper,
you might end up facing

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
some harsh truths that are
pretty difficult to swallow.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
I'm aware, but I wanna
know about Kano.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
So I've decided to
just think positive.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
Think positive?

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, atta girl!
--Too close!

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] I guess I was
wrong about you!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you?

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
You've got the right idea!

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
Gotta stay positive!

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA] It won't be an easy task
winning Gauma back to our side.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
And since they continue
to interfere with us.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it would be
best to just kill them.

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
Changing your mind?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
I've been saying this
from the start, remember?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
What do you think, Mujina?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA] Mm. Nothing, I'll do
whatever we decide.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
I'm against it.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why's that?

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] Dynazenon might
very well be the reason

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
why kaiju keep appearing.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
Hm?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
Yes, it would be easy enough
to kill all those guys.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
However, I'd like to
meet more Kaiju first.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
So you're saying
there's no rush?

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
I truly believe that this world
is heading in a good direction.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
What's up? You okay?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
Nah, not really.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Why not?

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
So, there's this girl I know.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
She's confronting something
tough and not running away.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
C'mon. This way.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Is this okay?

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Check it out. Cool, right?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
Whose is it?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
When I first found it, I wasn't
really sure what to do.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
If nothing else, I thought
I could at least show you.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Uh. I think
this is a bad idea.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay. Besides, no one
else knows it's here.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
U-Um. Sorry!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
Oh... uh...

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
The thing is, she may be right.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
What's bright?

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
You know...

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
Bright as in brighter
than the sun.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Uh, hey!

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[ARATA]
Yo.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Uh...

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO] Oh, I had him swing
by since he was close.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
So this is Arata.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
Uh... he's my husband.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
O-Oh. Y-You're...

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
Hello. I'm Arata Tachibana.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
I run a shop in Sanae.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Yeah... likewise.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[ARATA]
Tiny table for three, huh?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Sure is.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
Anyway, she always talks
about you, Yamamoto.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
It's Yamanaka.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? I'm sorry, man.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
So you guys have
known each other

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
since middle school, right?

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
Tell me, has she always
been rambunctious?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
Having hometown pals is
pretty great, I'm happy for you.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
[ARATA] You know I still
hang out with my old crew

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
whenever I can.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
You know what,

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
it's been a while since I've
been able to play futsal.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:45.655 position:50% align:center
Then, last week I went to--

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
Do you work nearby
or something, Yamamoto?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
This has been so much fun.
Thank you for coming.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Yeah, man. Let's hang out again.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Uh, sure. S-Someday s-soon.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
[CHISE gasps]

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
[CHISE sighs]
The big guy's late.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
[CHISE grunts]

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
What is this?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[ARATA] Yamamoto... Yamamoto...
Yamamoto... Yamamoto...

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
Who the hell is Yamamoto?

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
Oh, darn it. Forgot my umbrella.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no. Isn't that
the enemy kaiju lady?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna say yeah.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
Judging by the weird outfit,
it is definitely her.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
But Gauma's not here right now.

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
Then why would she
wanna mess with me?

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Although it did kinda look
like she was staring--

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
Oh. Dynazenon.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Oh! Kaiju Eugenicist1

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
I am starving.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Oh, crap. Please, don't eat me.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Are you drunk?

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
Get this.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
Yomogi's made some really
interesting friends lately!

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center

Uh-huh. Like, who's the one
that comes to eat with us?

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Uh, what was his name again?

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
You mean Gauma?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
Gauma, yeah!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Mom, you're so loud.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] He seems
like such a nice young man.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
He has a job, right?
What is it he does?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
I dunno, it's something
part-time.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yeah?
--Part-time, eh?

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yomogi's working
a lot these days.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
Sure he'll need the
money for girlfriends!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yes, I'm sure
it's only a matter of time.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Uh, just so
we're on the same page,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
I don't have any money.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
I realize that.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
I don't have to pay?

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Give it a rest.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
Why complain about
her marriage?

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
Was she just leading
me on or what?

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Even worse,
she invited him along.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Like, what the hell?

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
C'mon. What am I even doing?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Jeez, would it kill you to be a
little less blunt about it?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
I don't know anything about you.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
Why would I, Koyomi?

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
much about myself.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that's strange.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
Unlike other people, I have
nothing I want to do.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
No desires.

Well, I don't either!

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center

[KANAE] Just so you know,
we didn't throw it.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center

have left it alone.
