[FUUMA] Maybe? Like I said,
it's just a rumor.

it was legit bullying or not,

something else there,

really didn't die by accident,

I wanna find out why.

Yeah, except if it was bullying,
then there won't be any proof.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center

Uh-huh. Like, who's the one
that comes to eat with us?

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Uh, what was his name again?

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
You mean Gauma?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
Gauma, yeah!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Mom, you're so loud.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] He seems
like such a nice young man.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
He has a job, right?
What is it he does?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
I dunno, it's something
part-time.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yeah?
--Part-time, eh?

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yomogi's working
a lot these days.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
Sure he'll need the
money for girlfriends!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM] Yes, I'm sure
it's only a matter of time.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Uh, just so
we're on the same page,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
I don't have any money.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
I realize that.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
I don't have to pay?

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Give it a rest.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
Why complain about
her marriage?

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
Was she just leading
me on or what?

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Even worse,
she invited him along.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Like, what the hell?

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
C'mon. What am I even doing?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Jeez, would it kill you to be a
little less blunt about it?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
I don't know anything about you.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
Why would I, Koyomi?

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
much about myself.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that's strange.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
Unlike other people, I have
nothing I want to do.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
No desires.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI gasps]
Well, I don't either!

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center

[KANAE] Just so you know,
we didn't throw it.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
We only put it here.

Why is it always like this?

just make a decision.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.037 position:50% align:center
At this rate, I should
have left it alone.
