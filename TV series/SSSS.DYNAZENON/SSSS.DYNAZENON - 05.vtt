00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
Right, here I go!

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.145 position:50% align:center
[CHISE shouts]

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:45.856 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Perfect!

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
Nice, Chise! You've got
incredible form!

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.194 position:50% align:center
[CHISE giggles]
Thank you!

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.279 position:50% align:center
It's pretty easy once
you get used to it.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.989 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's easy, huh?

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
I guess she's a fast learner.

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:58.577 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] Oh yeah.
I've got a quick question.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.204 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
What's up?

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.664 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] I was thinking about
Dyna Soldier and Dyna Wing,

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
and how they can both
combine together, right?

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.335 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Yep.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] So in theory,
shouldn't it also be able

00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
to do the same thing with
Koyomi's Dyna Striker?

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.467 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.551 position:50% align:center
You wanna try it?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
You mean, like, right now?

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.932 position:50% align:center
Alright, in that case,
it's all you, Yomo!

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.935 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hold on, why me?

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:26.396 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Eh... I wanted to leave early.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.314 position:50% align:center
Remember?

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.608 position:50% align:center
Then I would suggest hurrying.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI, YOMOGI]
Dyna Soldier... Striker Combine!

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
There. Nice and combined.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.631 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that looks pretty slick!

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd call that
a real success.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.094 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI] U-Uh, c-careful!
--[KOYOMI] Hey!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.804 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI yelps]

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.557 position:50% align:center
[YUME sighs]
That sucks.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
Yeah. If they can't even
stand up straight,

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.979 position:50% align:center
might be a balance problem.

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
All right! Try again!

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I actually
need to get going.

00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Hm?

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.820 position:50% align:center
[YUME gasps]
Me, too.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.948 position:50% align:center
Fine. You do what you
gotta do, I guess.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
Hey. I've got plans, too.

00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:21.827 position:50% align:center
No way, even you?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
Yes, even me.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.414 position:50% align:center
I told you I needed to
take off early today!

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.583 position:50% align:center
And, yet, I still
came to training.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:31.128 position:50% align:center
Yeah but, isn't every day a day
off when you're unemployed?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Alright! Let's call it, then.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.175 position:50% align:center
Disperse!

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
[URITA] Sorry. All I have
is the edited version,

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
so it might not be what
you're looking for.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.728 position:50% align:center
No. This is great. Thanks.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
This video isn't exactly public.

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
You can't actually view it
unless you have the link

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
from the other club members.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah?

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.279 position:50% align:center
There's a lot of goofing around,

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
so we hid it from the
school and stuff.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.867 position:50% align:center
No one wanted to get in trouble.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.995 position:50% align:center
It won't show up
in any searches.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
Right. Guess that makes sense.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.294 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
She's... smiling a lot.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.174 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
So, um...

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.759 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO giggles]
What?

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
Is this really okay?

00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.887 position:50% align:center
To, uh, to drink together?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Well, it's just...
A-Aren't you married, Inamoto?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that's
certainly true.

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
You know, Inamoto isn't
my last name anymore.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.651 position:50% align:center
So then, is it okay for
you to drink with me?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.529 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO chuckles]
Yeah, it's fine. Jeez.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.197 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI grunts]
Okay.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
Still though.
Why'd I get married?

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Hey, Koyomi.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
You haven't told anybody
my secret, have you?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
About the thing you saw?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
I haven't.

00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
It'd be really bad if the school
found out I broke the glass.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:01.802 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean?

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.681 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
I might get expelled.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
Wait, I thought they didn't
do that to middle-schoolers?

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO chuckles]

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO] Oh, hey. You wanna
see something awesome?

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Well, tonight was fun!

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Uh-huh.

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Bye! Take care!

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
Yo, come on, buddy.

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
You need to move on from
the women of the past.

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
You wanna see
something awesome?

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.963 position:50% align:center
Awesome how?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.592 position:50% align:center
Ta-dah! Guess who won free
tickets to Tokyo Beach Land?

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
It starts with a "Ch"
and ends with an "ise"!

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
[school bell rings]

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Uh hey,
isn't Sizumu supposed to be

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
our enemy or something?

00:05:58.442 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.988 position:50% align:center
I mean, if nothing else,
he's at least an enemy to Gauma.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
So what's our relationship
with someone

00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
who's a Kaiju Eugenicist,
that's also our classmate?

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.871 position:50% align:center
Relationship, huh?

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO] Ask the girl
out on a date, already.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
It's not that easy.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
[phone beeps]

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] I won free tickets
to Tokyo Beach Land!

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Let's all hit up the
pool this weekend!

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.472 position:50% align:center
The pool? Whatcha think?

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.473 position:50% align:center
[YUME sighs]

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.225 position:50% align:center
Um. So you don't wanna go?

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.768 position:50% align:center
--Sounds fun.
--[YOMOGI, YUME gasp]

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
The pool. Would it be
okay if I tag along?

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. We should all go.

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.075 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]]
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.328 position:50% align:center
It might just be the perfect
opportunity to capture Sizumu.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Yume, genius idea!

00:06:54.498 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Well, I figured it'd be a good
idea for us to work together.

00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.794 position:50% align:center
Oh, that makes sense.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get to him when
he was hiding at your school,

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
but this time,
I'll nab him for sure.

00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
Captain Gauma, sir. Do you
have a plan or something?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Yes!

00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
Which is?

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.556 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
It's...

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.640 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI, YOMOGI, YUME]
Uh?

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:12.933 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
It's...?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.518 position:50% align:center
It's like this!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[train rumbles]

First thing's first!

Time for food!

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.526 position:50% align:center
You can't do squat
on an empty stomach!

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.654 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] Hey big guy, do you
even have a swimsuit?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.867 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] This time, I'll get
him for sure! Like, bam!

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.661 position:50% align:center
--[YOMOGI] Well, whatever.
--[YUME] Elementary school?

It's Sunday!

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
And, yet, this place
is miraculously dead.

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
Probably 'cause it's June?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.005 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA grunts]

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gauma. Your face.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.139 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] Uh, which arm
do I wear the key on?

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Uh, I don't think
it matters that much,

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
to be honest.

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
...payback for sure.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna nab you when
you least expect it.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.189 position:50% align:center
We can hear you, Gauma!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
So, do you go to
the pool a lot?

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.654 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. I'm not
much of a swimmer.

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.031 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.038 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] We'll have to
catch him off guard.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.582 position:50% align:center
You two can pretend to
be lovers or something.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
Just act natural, okay?

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
Wait, but that's the
opposite of natural!

00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
For real. Be on your guard.

00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
Right.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.301 position:50% align:center

Good.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
Move out!

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:40.187 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Act like lovers.
How, though?

[YOMOGI gasps]
Wow, I'm not really sure.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Like, how long should
we say that you and I

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:48.320 position:50% align:center
have been dating?

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Huh?

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.242 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh...? Never mind.

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] Let's start with one
of the smaller slides.

Now that we're not on
the school grounds,

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.923 position:50% align:center
nobody is here to
get in my way.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
Better prepare yourself, Sizumu!

00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Here I go!

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:13.220 position:50% align:center
No running by
the pool, please!

[GAUMA yelps]

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.226 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. Taking a break to eat?

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:23.647 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I actually didn't
have breakfast, so...

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
Churro, huh?

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:34.408 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Man, the sugar's
getting everywhere.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
Taste good?

00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Mm-hm.

[footsteps]

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.007 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Hey there, Sizumu.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.009 position:50% align:center
So, uh, where's Gauma?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.261 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's getting
yelled at for running.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.138 position:50% align:center
Cool, that's embarrassing.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
You guys can go
ahead if you want.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:09:59.850 position:50% align:center
Don't wait on me.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
Yomogi, let's go.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
Sure. So where to?

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
There. Wanna do that?

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Mm?

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.279 position:50% align:center
There's no line
right now. C'mon.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wait a sec.

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
We're not allowed to run.

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Good point.
Don't wanna get yelled at.

Look! Some inner tubes!

Cool. Grab 'em.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.949 position:50% align:center
Those two are really hitting
it off, aren't they?

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
They sure are.

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.202 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen Gauma in a while.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:05.082 position:50% align:center
Aw... Me either. I wonder
if his strategy succeeded.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Look at you,
casually lounging around.

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
Whatever, I am so
gonna capture you!

00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
Right, just like I planned.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Here goes--

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Hm?

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
No jumping, please!

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:23.684 position:50% align:center
Ugh, damn that Sizumu.
I'll make him pay.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
You alright?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't you worry.

00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
This operation is
just getting started.

00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
Okay, but you're so beat up.

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:36.572 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI] Uh, you wanna
relax in the onsen?

00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
[POOL GUY B]
Whoa! I almost fell!

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.576 position:50% align:center
This is harder than it looks.

00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
Think you can make it across?

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Probably.

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:45.664 position:50% align:center
[POOL GIRL B yells]

[YUME gasps]

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.882 position:50% align:center
Told you I was gonna fall!

00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
Sorry... I've gotta go.

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh?

00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Have I run
you around too much?

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to.

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:30.334 position:50% align:center
[YUME] No. It's not
your fault, Yomogi.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
I wonder what's up
with Gauma.

00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.882 position:50% align:center
You know, like with
his strategy.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.050 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Strategy?

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.343 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Uh?

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
Thanks you guys, that's better.

00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.641 position:50% align:center

[GAUMA groans]

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI, CHISE gasp]

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:56.193 position:50% align:center
Gauma's kinda lacking in
the stamina department, huh?

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.780 position:50% align:center
Uh, so when I said "strategy,"
what I meant was...

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
A plan... for friendship.

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.660 position:50% align:center
You know, like a
"getting along" plan.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.328 position:50% align:center
Or something.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.497 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Know what?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.959 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Forget I
said anything.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.545 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering, but are
you two dating each other?

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who? Us?

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.549 position:50% align:center
Uh.. well, uh...

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.092 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's just...

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
Sometimes people like to give
themselves purpose that way.

00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
What do you mean?

00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:28.517 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] They seek freedom while
also constraining themselves.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
They influence others.

00:13:30.227 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
All while also being
influenced themselves.

00:13:33.564 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Isn't that sad?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.400 position:50% align:center
I dunno about that,

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.986 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say I feel
particularly constrained.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.529 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Yes, well...

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
...that's only because you guys
can't see your own prisons.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Right.

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:47.411 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Why did you approach
us in the first place?

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
It's like I told you before,
I was curious.

00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Because we pilot Dynazenon?

00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:57.171 position:50% align:center
That's one reason, but I also
felt some emotions from you.

00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.881 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Emotions?

00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:00.299 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
That's right.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Emotions are a
kaiju's favorite thing.

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.595 position:50% align:center
Wait, so kaiju
have preferences?

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center

It's your turn, Sizumu!

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.980 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll see you later then.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.982 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are we leaving?

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.609 position:50% align:center
But we just got here.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.194 position:50% align:center
Whoa, are you kidding me?

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:22.571 position:50% align:center
You know we're about
to wreck shit up!

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.865 position:50% align:center
Then can we come back
when we're done?

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:28.035 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA chuckles]
Sure, I don't see why not.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
What was that about?

00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:36.877 position:50% align:center
Yomogi! Were the Kaiju
Eugenicists just here?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.881 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Oh, but they all
left pretty quickly.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center

tickets to the pool like me?

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It should do.

He told me you wanna
know about Kano?

Yes. I'm curious about what
happened before the accident.

It's been bothering me.

It's just a rumor I heard,
