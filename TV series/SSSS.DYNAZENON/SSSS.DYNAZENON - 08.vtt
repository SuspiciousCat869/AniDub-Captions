00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
C'mon, loosen up a little bit.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
Did the two of you always
get along this well?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Absolutely not.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
[SECOND] Naturally,
it's believed that kaiju

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
have a source.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
[SECOND] However, for kaiju
to appear this frequently,

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
then there would have to be
someone behind everything.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
they were deliberately
scattered all over the place.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Like by the Kaiju Eugenicists?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
[SECOND]
Mm.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
The human heart is responsible
for feeding the source.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
Their emotions then give
birth to and nurture kaiju.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
That's how they grow.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA grunts]
So, tell me.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
How do you guys know
about all this stuff?

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're kaiju.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that a
kaiju user like you

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
didn't know about the
things they just said?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's news to me.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
If I'm being perfectly
honest with you,

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
we never really needed to
know how kaiju were born.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] The reason why this
kaiju may be incomplete

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
is because the human
who is responsible for it

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
is incomplete, as well.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
With that said,

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
If it were to suddenly grow,
it could be rather dangerous.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Do you really think so?

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] There's no way we
can just leave it alone.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
We know. That's why I'm
keeping an eye on it.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Won't the kaiju absorb
emotions or something?

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
You mean, like mine?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.
Just watch it closely.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I already
told you that I would.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
I see, so they really grow
through human emotions?

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
--[MUJINA] Woo!
--[ONIJA] Yeah!

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
No!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
Oh, shit!

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Come on!

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
--Stop pushing me, you idiot!
--Would you go faster, already?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I told you to stop!

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
Is it really okay
to be doing this?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
At least you behave.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Now if only you weren't
such an eyesore.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA sighs]
Well I guess it's fine.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
That person was always
kind to living things.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Where are you, Princess?

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] In this world, there are
three things that are really

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
important for people to keep:

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
Promises, love, and...

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA snores]

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA yanws]
Is it already this late?

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
I'm tired.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA groans]

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA gasps]

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey, hey, oh crap!

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] So, before you
guys say anything,

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
I swear I was watching it!

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
But in an instant--the instant
I looked away, it...

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
Uh, Gauma. That's like
the third time.

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
Anyway, excuses aside,
what should we do now, Captain?

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Obviously. We'll split
up and look for the kaiju!

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
You know today is Sunday, right?

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Uh, sorry.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
It's whatever.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA sighs]

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
It's morning, Mujina.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Uh?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA grunts]

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
Shall we head back, then?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
You guys wanna see a movie?

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
Whoa, shouldn't we--?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Which movie are you thinking?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
You're going?

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
Come on, where could
it have gone to?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You serious?

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA, MUJINA] This movie
sounds totally awesome.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
Huh?

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
What are you doing?

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Huh? Knight?

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
The little kaiju we found
earlier got away.

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
I knew I should have just dealt
with it properly back then.

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
Guess I have no
choice but to step in.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps] Hold up,
then does that mean you know

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
a good way to find the kaiju?

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
What seriously?
Well, that's a relief!

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
Yomogi Asanaka,
let's go and find the kaiju.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay. I appreciate the help.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
So, like do you have a plan?

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
Search until we find it.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
Search until we find it.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Yeah! Sick!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

You taking a break, too, Minami?

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Yep. There's no
sign of the kaiju.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] 
Tell me about it.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
Watching a movie?

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
My battery's gonna die.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Listen, about the kaiju.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Do you think it has a heart?

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT] What makes you ask
that?

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Until now...
I thought we had to kill kaiju

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
because they wrecked things
and posed a threat to humanity.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
But, if what you
told us is true,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
and the kaiju really are born
from a human's emotions,

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
then maybe there's a kaiju out
there with feelings like us.

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Some kaiju do have hearts.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Okay, so what if this one--?

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
Others will fool you.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
If you guess wrong and
people die, it's too late.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Why do you know so
much about kaiju, anyway?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT]
I just do.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
Look, if I determine that
a kaiju is dangerous,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
I will kill it. As I always do.
