[INAMOTO]
Well, thank you.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid you're a little
late for congratulations.

00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
What about you? Are you married?

00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
No. Um, not yet, anyway.

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:00.207 position:50% align:center
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.501 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Mm. Uh, not yet, anyway.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:05.087 position:50% align:center
Hey. We should totally
exchange contact info.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.088 position:50% align:center
Where's my phone?

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.381 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
'Kay.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] Hey, big guy.
That your ex-girlfriend?

00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:15.639 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
What? No way.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
I thought so.

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
Heck, I bet you've never
dated anyone, have you?

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:20.269 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Pfft.

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:22.104 position:50% align:center
But more importantly,
do you still like her?

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
No, it's not like that.

00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
So it is like that...

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.697 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to
pull you away from your friends.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.533 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
O-Oh. It's cool, um?

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.826 position:50% align:center
Ah, my name's Juuga.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]
Um, I'm Yomogi Asanaka.

00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:43.000 position:50% align:center
Well, Yomogi, I was hoping
to chat with you for a bit.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
'Kay. So, uh...

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.297 position:50% align:center
You said that Gauma was a
comrade of yours in the past

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
or something like that.

00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
Correct. Gauma is someone
I used to look up to.

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
Five-thousand years ago.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.848 position:50% align:center
See, we died 5,000 years ago,

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
then we were revived
in this era. It's odd.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that
goes beyond odd.

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.316 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA chuckles]
I suppose.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] But, if you
used to be comrades,

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:11.320 position:50% align:center
then why aren't
you together now?

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA] That's something
you should ask <i>him</i> .

00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.327 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI grunts] I should
start heading to work. Sorry.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's no problem.
Thank you so much for your time.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.629 position:50% align:center
What the hell was that, Juuga?

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:32.299 position:50% align:center
If we just kill the kid, then
this whole thing will be over.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA]
If they're kaiju users,

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
why not have them
as comrades instead?

00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:37.471 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
But Dynazenon?

00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
It's not like any of us were
able to take to control

00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:42.351 position:50% align:center
of that phony kaiju.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.478 position:50% align:center
Then that means
it's not a kaiju.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
Who freakin' cares?

00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:49.233 position:50% align:center
Let's just crush the hell outta
Gauma and get on with it!

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.949 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Oh by the way, Freshman.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
We should talk
about your no-show.

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.
Look, I'm really sorry.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Why weren't you here?

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
I got held up, uh,
helping people in need.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.629 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real?
That a new trend?

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] So hey, why are
we meeting up so late?

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
If we're not careful, someone
might call the cops on us.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.638 position:50% align:center
We have an adult with us,
so it should be fine.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.557 position:50% align:center
Yeah, an unemployed one.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that me?

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.270 position:50% align:center
[YUME, YOMOGI]
Unemployed?

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
Uh. Technically I help
pilot Dynazenon now.

00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:31.275 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what's this about?

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.861 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I spoke
with Juuga today.

00:11:33.944 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Who?

00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
He was there before, right?
He's a kaiju user?

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:40.242 position:50% align:center
Yep. He told me
about him and Gauma.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:44.413 position:50% align:center
They died 5,000 ears ago, but
they were revived in this era.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.706 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Five thousand years?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.291 position:50% align:center
They've been revived...

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
They're all kaiju users?

00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.295 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
That's a lot.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
Hey, I don't know
what to tell you.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:57.176 position:50% align:center
But, when we fought, they said
Gauma was a traitor, remember?

00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
If you had to choose between
this Juuga guy and Gauma,

00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
which one do you trust?

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:03.849 position:50% align:center
Honestly? Neither.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
That's fair.

00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:07.186 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Five thousand years.

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:10.564 position:50% align:center
In that case, why don't we
just go ask Gauma directly?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
We could. Where does he live?

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Hm!

00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Hey, Gauma! You in there?

00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Yo, what do you guys want?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.326 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
What's that you're eating?

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.578 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Crabs. They're everywhere here.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Cool...

00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
So, what do you guys want?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:28.874 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Um...

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
We were wondering if
it was true that you

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.587 position:50% align:center
and the Kaiju Eugenicists
used to be comrades?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Yeah, like 5,000 years ago.

00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:38.592 position:50% align:center
Aha! Five-thousand years!
See there?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.344 position:50% align:center
But why are you asking me?

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.347 position:50% align:center
Well, for starters, we heard
that you may have betrayed them.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.934 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, I guess
you could say that.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.060 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Why'd you do it?

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
Because I had to
stop those guys.

00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:51.772 position:50% align:center
They're complete psychos.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
Like c'mon, they carry
out the will of kaiju.

00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Okay! So you betrayed
them to protect people?

00:12:57.653 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
That's why you did it?

00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Would you give it
a rest, already?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.200 position:50% align:center
My past is really none
of your business.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.535 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Yeah, but...

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Gotta run.
I'm working the night shift.

00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:09.373 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
You have a job? For real?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Gotta feed myself.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:17.548 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I wonder.

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
Do you think he just likes
fighting in robots?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Maybe. What if
he's actually a psycho?

00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
He's definitely a psycho.

00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
[CHISE] The dude was straight
up eating live crabs.

00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
What's he fighting for?

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
There has to be a
reason for it, right?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.693 position:50% align:center

00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:58.876 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec, we haven't had
the time to practice combining!

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Hey! If our feelings
are together,

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:02.296 position:50% align:center
then it will work!

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.172 position:50% align:center
No, it won't.

00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:16:04.423 --> 00:16:06.258 position:50% align:center
Because we'll never
unite our feelings.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.259 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.844 position:50% align:center
Gauma.

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.013 position:50% align:center
Look, we're afraid that there's
something you're not telling us.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.556 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
For real?

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.017 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] All we want is for you
to be honest with us, Gauma!

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Okay fine, but can we
please just do this later?

00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
No, we want to know now!

00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
Time to die! Seeya, phony kaiju!

00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:25.736 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Listen up, Yomogi.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
In this world, there are
three very important things

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.990 position:50% align:center
that people need to keep:

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.201 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
You've said that before!

00:16:32.284 --> 00:16:35.454 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Promises, love, and...

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:39.208 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA laughs] You thought your
phony kaiju stood a chance?

00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.460 position:50% align:center
I just totally destroyed you!

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
Guess the traitor's
now a crater!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:46.924 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
You moron!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:50.219 position:50% align:center
We almost bit the dust
because of all your yapping!

00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Well, it's your
fault for not answering!

00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
If you'd spit it out,
then we could all move on!

00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Are we falling?

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yes, you're very heavy!

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:02.898 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Listen. We want
to know about you, Gauma!

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
Yomogi.

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:05.359 position:50% align:center
There's a reason
you're fighting!

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
We want you to trust in us.

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:09.196 position:50% align:center
Tell us about yourself.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:17:11.657 --> 00:17:12.658 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Right now?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.785 position:50% align:center
Yes, please!

00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:17.496 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Okay.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.666 position:50% align:center
There's someone...
I want to meet.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI, YUME, KOYOMI]
Huh?

00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.087 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] They're the person who
entrusted Dynazenon to me.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.257 position:50% align:center
I was given this power,
so in this era,

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.925 position:50% align:center
I could find them again.

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.802 position:50% align:center
That's the reason
why I'm fighting.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
Hold up a sec, is this
person a man or a woman?

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
A woman.

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:39.560 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI, YUME, KOYOMI]
Ah.

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:41.395 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
I'm sorry for not telling you!

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
But please, fight with me!

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Only Dynazenon can
defeat these kaiju!

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:49.695 position:50% align:center
Yomogi. Yume. Koyomi.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.532 position:50% align:center
In this moment...
I really need you guys!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:54.867 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Thank you!

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.035 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Combine Dragon. Dynazenon!

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:57.179 position:50% align:center
Who cares if you've combined?
It doesn't change anything!

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] You're about to get
a taste of our full power.

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
Our combined power!

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.242 position:50% align:center

Dyna Saber!

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.331 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA grunts]

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.207 position:50% align:center

[GAUMA grunts]
Curse these damn explosions!

00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:39.972 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, what if
there was no fire?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.641 position:50% align:center
We'd need a place
that has... no air!

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.852 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Is there even
a place like that?

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hold up,
can't Dynazenon fly?

00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
That could actually work!

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
Up there?

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Back then...

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
...our four hearts
were all connected!

00:19:56.572 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
Alright, let's combine our
feelings together again!

00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:03.412 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Then we can beat this guy!

You know,

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:37.089 position:50% align:center
I died 5,000 years ago and
was revived in this era, so...

00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
The person you wanna meet.

00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:41.844 position:50% align:center
Do you think this means they
could have been revived, too?

00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I've actually
been trying to find them.

00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:49.101 position:50% align:center
I really believe we'll
meet again someday.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.812 position:50% align:center
Maybe the only
reason we revived,

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
is because kaiju
defy common sense.

00:21:54.523 --> 00:21:56.400 position:50% align:center
So we are beyond that.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.527 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
The power of a kaiju...

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center
...makes the impossible
possible, right?

00:22:02.948 --> 00:22:05.409 position:50% align:center
Like, they can revive people.

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:16.879 position:50% align:center
