Back then...

What was I thinking
about in that moment?

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Not good. We better
take care of this kaiju.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but without Minami here,
we can't exactly combine.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center

You have to beat the kaiju.

And once you disable its power,

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
all the people who are trapped
inside should return!

time to beat this kaiju!

[GAUMA] Please. I can't
remember every damn detail.
