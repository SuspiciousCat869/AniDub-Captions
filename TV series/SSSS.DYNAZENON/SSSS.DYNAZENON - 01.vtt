[YUME'S MOM]
What now?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
[YUME'S DAD] I think it's time
for you to clean something, too.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center

Which would be?

the incident happened
at around 6 O'clock...

You don't have to pretend.

So why are you here?

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
You're way late, you know.

It is!

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
You ditched him.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
Am I right? This was
all just a mean trick?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
So you weren't gonna go, but you
still made him wait anyway?

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
Are you toying with him?

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. What if I was?

In this world, there are three
things that people need to keep:

The first is promises,
and the next thing is,

uh, what was it again?

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center

[YOMOGI]
Huh? What do you mean?

has been toying with you

kidding me with this!
