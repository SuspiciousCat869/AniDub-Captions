[YOMOGI]
Gauma.

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.792
Here, Yomogi.
Please allow me to help.

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.375
[YUME]
Is he healing?

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:32.208
Sorry, but this
isn't a Fixer Beam.

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:36.166
If nothing else, it'll at
least ease his pain.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.792
[YOMOGI] We'll never get an
ambulance here in this mess.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.750
[SECOND] Hang in there a
bit longer, Gauma... Knight.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:48.500

[SIZUMU laughs]

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.041
It's a kaiju!

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.917
How is this happening?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.250
Here I thought that there
wouldn't be any more appearing.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.542
I see. That means the world
of kaiju isn't over just yet!

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:12.583
[ONIJA gasps]
What's up, Juuga?

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.125
[JUUGA]
This kaiju!

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.500
[gasps]
Could it be...

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.417
It's Sizumu?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.834
Take me with you.
Please, Sizumu!

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:30.417
I wanna see that future,
the one that has kaiju!

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.792
And you two? What's your choice?

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.750
Of course I choose the
future where I kill

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:41.792
as many humans as possible.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.667
In the end, this is all
that's left for me.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:00.542
[KNIGHT]
What?

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.709
[SIZUMU laughs]

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:07.667
[KNIGHT grunts] No way.
He's even stronger than before!

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.917
[grunts]

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.542
Gauma!

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.083
Good, you're awake.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.125
[YOMOGI]
You okay?

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.125
[GAUMA]
I don't know, am I?

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.959
Your face says a lot.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.417
[GAUMA]
I don't think... I've got long.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
[SECOND]
Stop it.

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.917
What are you even saying?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.625
Look, Yomogi... Yume...

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.917
I'm sorry I got you two into
this mess with all the kaiju

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.333
and the eugenicists.

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:46.041
Everything that happened
back then, 5,000 years ago...

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.834
It doesn't involve you.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.625
How can you say
something so stupid?

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.709
Gauma, you were the one
who brought us into this!

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:56.333
With Dynazenon!

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.709
[YOMOGI]
It's your fault.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:02.709
You're the reason we built this
connection in the first place!

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.792
[grunts, sighs]

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:11.625
I'm really sorry.
No, that isn't right.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.375
I meant thanks.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:17.291
[GAUMA]
Please tell Koyomi for me.

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:25.041
No, you tell him yourself.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.417
You need to live,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.667
so you can just tell him
with your own words!

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.041
Jeez, man, you're so loud.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:37.625
[KNIGHT]
Kaiser Knight... Double Storm!

[KNIGHT screams]

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.750
Yomogi, let's go.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.500
There's still something
we can do... if we hurry.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.959
[YOMOGI] Second, please take
care of Gauma for us.

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.333
I will. Be careful.

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:06.667
[YOMOGI]
Right. See you soon.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.834
[YUME]
Yeah.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:10.000
[ANNOUNCEMENT VOICE]
The train has come

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.959
to an emergency stop.
We apologize for--

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.041
[KOYOMI pants]

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.959
[gasps]

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.792
[KOYOMI] It's all a coincidence,
just like that day.

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.291
What's different... is me.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.792
[GAUMA grunts]

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:32.542
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:35.375
If I don't find a way
to defeat that kaiju,

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:39.041
then those guys might
lose their future.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.458
Get it?

00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:43.750
I sure as hell didn't
revive for an easy life.

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:47.208
[SECOND] You can't, though!
You're in no shape for it!

00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.667
[GAUMA] In this world, there're
three important things...

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.667
...you've gotta keep.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.834

[YOMOGI grunts]

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.917
[YOMOGI]
I like you.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.583
Will you date me?

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:17.291
Oh yeah, she never answered me.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.250
Hm... Perfect timing, huh?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.417

C'mon, they're waiting for us!

Of course you're okay.

kill Chise's friend!

I'm here for Koyomi.

To give him my
sincere apologies.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm sorry I got you involved.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:14.875
Thanks, Gauma.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.583
But, uh, what are
we talking about?

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:22.375
Heh. I see. Guess there's
still a lot to explain.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:23.375
[KOYOMI]
Uh...

Gauma, I told you to wait.

Why are you here?

[GAUMA] Hmph. Look, you may
not want my help,

00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:33.250
but I'm still giving it.

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:37.458
[KNIGHT] Then don't regret it.
It's time to combine our powers!

I always used to
look up to you!

I needed you, and whether
you want to believe it,

you needed me, too!
And yet, you betrayed us!

If you won't stay away.

then this time I'll make
sure you stay dead.

I realize the only real thing
I have left are kaiju!

That's all I have in

that's why...
I couldn't ever do it.

[SIZUMU] Because Kaiju can't
be understood by people.

[SIZUMU] That's how the
power of kaiju works.
