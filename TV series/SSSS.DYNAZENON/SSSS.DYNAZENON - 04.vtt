Sorry, guys,

[GAUMA]
Oh yeah, she's skipping today.

So... Minami's meeting someone?

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.644 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] It'd be weird
if I asked about it.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.233 position:50% align:center
My impression of Kano?

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is that really why
you asked me to meet up?

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Hm...

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
She was super serious
about practice.

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
Always worked hard and stuff.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.954 position:50% align:center
Despite that, pretty much
everyone in the club loved her

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.664 position:50% align:center
because she was so cheerful.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.957 position:50% align:center
Whoa, really?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.292 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Yeah1

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.169 position:50% align:center
I see. That's surprising.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
[YUME] It just sounds so
different than the Kano I knew.

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.549 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
Well, now that I think about it,
I should tell you Kano

00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.889 position:50% align:center
picked out the song for
the recital back then.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
It's too bad she--
O-Oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
No, it's fine.

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
I mean, I wanted
to meet with you

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
so that I could learn
stuff like that, you know?

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.276 position:50% align:center
[KANAE exhales]
In that case,

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.278 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I can't
be a bigger help.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.155 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Hey, it's okay.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.450 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Actually, I think Urita
might have a video of her.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.868 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Yeah. We used to take
videos of our practices

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.872 position:50% align:center
for the club's records.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
Kano's got to be in
at least one of them.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
Want his number?

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.294 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.215 position:50% align:center
I'm positive that Urita
would be happy to help out.

00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Thank you so much.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center

Hey, so are you, like,

00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
going around and asking
people about Kano, or what?

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
I just wish I could know more
about my big sister, you know?

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.232 position:50% align:center
I see.

Well, I'll let you know
if I think of something.

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
Seeing as how I'm a new
exchange student in your school,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.762 position:50% align:center
I hope we can all get along.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.934 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
Whoa. That caught me off guard.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.186 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
His outfit? Yeah.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.938 position:50% align:center
I know he said he's
not here to fight,

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.649 position:50% align:center
but I wonder if we
should tell Gauma anyway.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.193 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] If we do, he might
charge in guns blazing.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Possibly.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.531 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Say what?
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:56.370 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
So, Sizumu.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.249 position:50% align:center
You guys used to get along with
Gauma 5,000 years ago, right?

00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:01.917 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Back then, we did.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.627 position:50% align:center
This is unreal.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
Why?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.505 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] I just thought maybe
you could settle things

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.965 position:50% align:center
without the kaiju.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.634 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] Even if we reconciled,
they would still appear.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.970 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Wait, do you
guys make the kaiju?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
No.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
You see, kaiju are all grown
from the will of people.

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:19.810 position:50% align:center
The Eugenicists
don't create kaiju.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.687 position:50% align:center
But we do want
to create a world.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
A world where they would
actually be needed.

00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:28.694 position:50% align:center
Be honest, you're not really
kaiju users, are you?

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say.

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:31.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't really think so,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.116 position:50% align:center
but Gauma certainly seems
to believe differently.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
what makes you think you
need to fight against kaiju?

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:39.538 position:50% align:center
Perhaps deep down,

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.249 position:50% align:center
it's possible you two
just want to fight them.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.542 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.711 position:50% align:center
We're just doing what
we can to help out.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
But why are kaiju born
in the first place?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.426 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] Even here, people may
seem like they're free,

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.970 position:50% align:center
but everyone's
bound by something.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.848 position:50% align:center
It's kaiju that free them
from that something.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
If that makes sense.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50% align:center
Come out! Where the
hell are you hiding?

00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
It's Gauma...

00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU]
What's with his outfit?

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI, YUME]
Hm?

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.610 position:50% align:center
Well I'm obviously not hiding.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
What are you plotting?

00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:13.739 position:50% align:center
Why'd you approach Yomogi
and Yume at school?

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.199 position:50% align:center
What's the matter,

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
are transfer students not
allowed to make friends now?

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Please, friends, my ass!

00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
Forget this, I'll slug
you in the kisser!

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
How'd he dodge it?

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:23.999 position:50% align:center
You literally told me.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.752 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] I'll slug you!
I'll slug you so hard!

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.171 position:50% align:center
You little! C'mere!

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate me,
you bastard!

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
What's going on here?

00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, hey.

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
It's cool, I just came
to see someone I know.

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
[MALE TEACHER A]
No, you're coming with us!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Wait! You've got all it wrong!

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.767 position:50% align:center
[MALE TEACHER B] Would you
behave and stop struggling?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Let go!
Listen, I can explain myself!

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.481 position:50% align:center
C'mon, what the hell
was Sizumu thinking?

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.192 position:50% align:center
Well, he can hear
kaiju voices, remember?

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
I trust that he has some
sort of plan in place.

00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:53.946 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Excuse me.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
Can I add the
<i>chawanmushi</i> , please?

00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:58.075 position:50% align:center
No problem, will that be all?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI sneezes]

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.960 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's a cold for sure.
Stay home today.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:11.672 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] No, I can't.
Ugh, my head's killing me.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
You cannot be serious.

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:15.634 position:50% align:center
You don't want to give your cold
to everybody else at school,

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.262 position:50% align:center
--do you?
--[YOMOGI] Mom. You're so loud.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
So anyway. How'd things
go after you left?

00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Bad.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.521 position:50% align:center
[CHISE]
Did you get reported?

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Yeah, and I
got fired from my job.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:31.859 position:50% align:center
What a huge joke.

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
Next time, I'll be more careful.

00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
[KOYOMI]
Uh, where's Yomogi?

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA]
Oh. Dude's got a nasty cold.

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
He probably won't be
coming for a while.

00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Man, wouldn't it be terrible
if a kaiju attacked right now?

00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:45.873 position:50% align:center
You so want that.

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
Hey, not related, but is it cool
if I take a day off next week?

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you're off every day.

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yume. Check up on
Yomogi after school today.

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Huh? You don't usually
visit people at home

00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.845 position:50% align:center
just for a cold, though.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.889 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Yeah, but Yomogi's
been really slacking lately.

00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
It's almost like his heart
isn't in it or something.

00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Hold up, how is that my problem?

00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
You're the one who made him
wait in the rain, remember?

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
He probably wouldn't
be sick otherwise.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.571 position:50% align:center
Look here. I think
I found a kaiju.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that one's real weird.
What a strange power.

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:30.584 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. I haven't spaced
out like this in a while.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[INAMOTO]
Look, Freshman.

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
You'd better make
your move quick.

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
Before it's too late.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.217 position:50% align:center
Ask the girl out on
a date, already.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI sighs]
A date.

00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
Something's wrong with me.

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:45.891 position:50% align:center
Ugh. When she's like that,
it's not exactly easy.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI'S MOM]
Here to visit?

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:50.229 position:50% align:center
Oh wow, it's so thoughtful
of you to stop by!

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:51.647 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
By the tone of her voice,

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.525 position:50% align:center
I bet it's just Gauma again.

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Oh. You're sleeping.

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
And here I bought
all this stuff.

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI gasps]

00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.622 position:50% align:center
You're awake.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.624 position:50% align:center
Huh? It's you?

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.841 position:50% align:center
[ONIJA]
That's super trippy.

00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[SIZUMU] But it is a
very kaiju-like power.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.512 position:50% align:center
[JUUGA] It's as if it
shifts dimensions.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Whatever, who cares?
It's all yours, Mujina!

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:30.686 position:50% align:center
[MUJINA]
Right, Instance. Domination.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.275 position:50% align:center
[YUME] Gauma said I should come
over and check up on you.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.280 position:50% align:center
Whatcha looking at?

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
What? You have something
you don't want me to see?

00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
Uh, not really,
look all you want.

00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.661 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
told jokes, Minami.

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:53.000 position:50% align:center
Huh? I'm capable
of humor, you know.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:56.420 position:50% align:center
Besides, you and I only
started talking recently.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
So, uh. I noticed you weren't
at training the other day.

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
Gauma told me you
couldn't make it.

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:05.721 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.015 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] He said you had
to meet with someone.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.267 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah. A chorus club grad.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.147 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Chorus club?
Oh, for your sister.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
I asked them about Kano,

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
and they knew some
stuff about her,

00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
but it didn't seem
like it was very much.

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI]
I see.

00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
[YUME] But, she put me in
touch with someone. A guy.

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
A guy, really?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI coughs]

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.457 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI coughs]
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.584 position:50% align:center
--[phone rings]
--[YUME] It's Gauma.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
Kaiju?

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
[GAUMA] Yume! Bring Dyna
Wing and come quick!

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.923 position:50% align:center
I'm on my way.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.341 position:50% align:center
Uh, Yomogi?

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.635 position:50% align:center
You're probably not any in
shape to be piloting, huh?

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI coughing]
But--!

00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:47.846 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Just give me yours.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.598 position:50% align:center
Uh, Dyna Soldier?

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.183 position:50% align:center
[YUME]
Yeah.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
It might be a long shot, but we
have to do everything we can.

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
Before it's too late.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.523 position:50% align:center
Too late, huh?

00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Thank you. We'll have to
find someone to pilot it.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.366 position:50% align:center

Dyna Soldier with me.

promise I'm really trying!

crush the little one, Mujina!

go to another memorial.

Perhaps deep down,

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
it's possible you two
just want to fight them.

need to fight against kaiju?

[YUME]
Yeah. We might need you!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.974 position:50% align:center
[YOMOGI] Having said that,
how do I get there?

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
It's not like I can borrow
my mom's car or anything.
