WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.602
(Yuma)
Last time on "Yu-Gi-Oh!
ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.870
Don Thousand!

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.468
I'm setting Alito free!

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:10.771
Lion Heart,
attack Comet Cestus!

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:18.212
(Don Thousand)
My control over
Alito is fading!

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:21.349
Astral, he's back
to his old self!

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.384
Stay where you are!

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.853
Our duel isn't over.

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:27.388
You remain my enemy.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:32.159
(both)
Now Lion Heart...
finish Comet Cestus!

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:41.302
(Don Thousand)
I require your indomitable soul,
your boundless fighting spirit!

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:43.271
It will make me invincible!

00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:45.873
This is why I shall
replace your memories

00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:48.476
with ones of my own design!

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:51.479
(Alito)
It's all coming
back to me.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.981
Every painful memory...

00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:58.085
We sure could
use your help, Alito.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.755
Even though Barian World
is the mortal enemy

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:02.423
of your precious Astral World,

00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:05.726
it may make sense for us
to defeat our common foe,

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:07.495
Don Thousand, first!

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:08.429
Let's do it!

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.464
Vector will lead
us straight to him.

00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:14.201
Our next stop is Barian World!

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.104

What the...?

00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:28.712
Oh, right.

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.020
Girag ambushed me.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.721
But why would he?

00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:35.623
I'm the leader of the Barians.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:37.392
Something's going on!

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:41.663
So you think you'll defeat us
and steal all of our powers?

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:42.830
Marin...
Dumon?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.033
(Dumon)
You have lost your
mind, Vector.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.768
There is no way
you can steal...

00:02:46.768 --> 00:02:47.535
(Vector) Poor Dumon.

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:49.704
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with.

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:53.975
You see, Don Thousand
and I have come to an agreement!

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:55.810
Don Thousand?

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.513
(laughing)

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:04.285
No...
It's really him!

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:08.022
You sound shocked to see me...

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:09.374
Incredible!

00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:10.875
Vector managed to
wake Don Thousand.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:15.280
(Don Thousand)
The time has finally come for
you to serve your purpose.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.051
I will consume your
energies to feed my power!

00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:20.418
Consume us?

00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:22.821
What makes you think that
we would ever agree

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:23.388
to let you do that?

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.391
It is your destiny
set in motion long ago.

00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:31.162
The seven emperors possess power
far greater than lesser Barians.

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:35.400
You will grant them to me,
or I will take them from you!

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:36.735
Don't be upset.

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:37.669
Look on the bright side.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.405
At least you get to join
the winning team for once!

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:43.074
You're one of the
emperors too, Vector!

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.409
He'll take you down too!

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.210
I think not.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.046
I have become one
with Don Thousand!

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.750
He is a Barian deity...
and so am I!

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.225
I have power!

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:03.395
I am power!

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:04.396
Not for long!

00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:08.400
We can beat you if we
gather the other emperors!

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.969
(laughing)

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.404
I am afraid not, Marin!

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:15.273
Girag is already
under my control!

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:18.410
And none of the others can
help you, either!

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.878
That can't be!

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:22.414
Alito was in my grasp too,
but I have learned

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:24.182
that he now sides with Yuma!

00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:26.217
You're saying they're allies?

00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:26.854
Yes.

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:30.824
Yuma, Astral, and their lap dog
Alito are headed here now,

00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:33.160
but I will crush
them all easily enough!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.663
It seems you're forgetting we've
still got Nash on our side!

00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:39.333
Oh, you do?

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.201
Now, enough talk!

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:43.770
I have entertained your
gibberish thus far,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.373
but the time has
come to face your fate!

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:49.810
It's just us so let's hit him
with everything we've got!

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.445
It's now or never!

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:52.145
I'm with you!

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:57.384
We'll turn Vector
into just a bad memory!

00:04:57.384 --> 00:04:58.852
Let's do it.

00:04:58.852 --> 00:05:02.155
♪♪

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.172
(all) Let us duel!

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:22.843
What is that?

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:24.578
That's a dimensional portal.

00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:27.180
Barian World is just
on the other side.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.850
That means it's go time!

00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:35.848
Two on one!

00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:37.950
Seems unfair, for you!

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.255
Because I can see how this story
ends, and you won't like it!

00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:46.391
But not to worry,
I won't keep you in suspense!

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.127
I'll make this quick
and painful!

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:52.397
I play the spell
Don Thousand's Throne!

00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:59.238
Now, I could just sit up
here and beat you...

00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:01.974
Oh, but that wouldn't be
very sporting of me would of me,

00:06:01.974 --> 00:06:02.407
would it?

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:07.713
So instead I'll equip Don
Thousand's Throne on to myself!

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:25.998
What's he doing?

00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:27.833
What's going on?

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.372
Looky, looky at
what I have here...

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:36.408
two Umbral Horror Ghosts
in my hand!

00:06:36.408 --> 00:06:39.945
And I can summon them
both for double the dread!

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.915
Now I'll keep tingling
your spine

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:45.183
with Umbral Horror
Will O' the Wisp!

00:06:45.183 --> 00:06:48.387
And I can change its Level
to Umbral Horror Ghost's,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.890
making sure it
becomes your worst nightmare!

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.661
Now I have three monsters
with the same Level!

00:06:55.661 --> 00:07:01.333
So I overlay my 2 Umbral Horror
Ghosts and Will O' the Wisp!

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:04.636
With these 3 monsters I
build the overlay Network

00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:09.207
and Xyz Summon Number 96,
Dark Mist!

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.885
Have you forgotten him already?

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:21.820
Dark Mist, don't be shy.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.624
Reveal your true form
to our guests!

00:07:28.393 --> 00:07:30.395
No, it can't be!

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:35.901
I'm sure you've
all met my friend?

00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.136
Doesn't he look familiar?

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:39.071
Yes!

00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:40.305
It's Number 96.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:43.342
You know, the "fun" Astral!

00:07:43.342 --> 00:07:43.875
But...

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.411
Yuma and Astral destroyed 96!

00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:49.681
No, but they
certainly came close.

00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:52.017
Luckily I snatched up
what was left,

00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:54.386
and made a few
improvements of my own!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.756
Now he exists to do my bidding!

00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:01.793
96 is my puppet...

00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:05.998
Which is exactly what both
of you will become very soon.

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.167
It must be nice to have
something like that

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.403
to look forward to.

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:12.871
Your move.

00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:15.707
What will you do?

00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:18.410
Oh, that's simple Vector...

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.413
Eliminate you!

00:08:21.413 --> 00:08:24.383
I summon Blizzard Thunderbird!

00:08:28.687 --> 00:08:32.257
Next, I activate
Blizzard Vision!

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:35.394
This card's going to put the
deep freeze on you, Vector,

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:39.831
because it transforms into
a second Blizzard Thunderbird!

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.405
Now I overlay my two Level 4
Blizzard Thunderbirds!

00:08:46.405 --> 00:08:48.040
I Xyz Summon!

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.177
Appear, Number 103:
Ragnazero!

00:08:59.384 --> 00:09:00.118
Ahh...

00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.387
Such a cute little thing!

00:09:02.387 --> 00:09:06.024
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:07.993
Now it is my turn, Vector!

00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:12.030
I will make you pay
for your treachery!

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.400
I summon Star Seraph Scout!

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:22.407
Star Seraph Scout lets me summon
another Star Seraph monster.

00:09:22.407 --> 00:09:25.143
Star Seraph Sage!

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.015
And Star Seraph Sage's
special ability

00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:32.818
lets me send one
spell card to the graveyard

00:09:32.818 --> 00:09:35.921
to summon yet another
Star Seraph monster.

00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:39.024
And I choose Star Seraph Sword

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.393
so that I can cut you
down to size!

00:09:41.626 --> 00:09:47.103
I overlay Level 4 Star Seraph
Scout, Sage and Sword

00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:52.936
to Xyz Summon Number
102: Star Seraph Sentry!

00:09:58.944 --> 00:10:01.413
I activate Sentry's
special ability!

00:10:01.413 --> 00:10:05.383
By using one Overlay Unit,
Dark Mist's special abilities

00:10:05.383 --> 00:10:10.388
are negated, and its attack
points cut in half!

00:10:16.294 --> 00:10:17.028
So what?

00:10:17.028 --> 00:10:19.097
All it lost was
50 attack points.

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:22.400
Those 50 points are gonna
lead to your downfall

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.402
thanks to Ragnazero's
special ability!

00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:28.039
By using one Overlay Unit,
it destroys any monster

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.374
that lost attack points!

00:10:29.374 --> 00:10:32.410
So say goodbye to Dark Mist!

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.279
What?

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.381
Doomsday Demolition!

00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:45.257
You are going down, Vector!

00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:49.194
I activate the spell
Star Seraph Starstream!

00:10:49.194 --> 00:10:51.830
When there is a Star Seraph
on my field

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.231
and your monster is destroyed,

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:58.203
this handy little card hits you
with 1,000 points of damage!

00:11:03.408 --> 00:11:04.910
How does that feel, Vector?

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.014
I'm guessing by your groaning
the answer is not so good!

00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:10.215
But it'll get worse!

00:11:10.215 --> 00:11:13.351
When Ragnazero's special
ability destroys a monster,

00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:15.287
I get to draw a card!

00:11:15.287 --> 00:11:19.090
And I place one card
facedown and end my...

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.326
Not so fast!

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:24.396
I activate
the trap Nightmare Xyz!

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:26.965
You may have gotten
rid of Number 96,

00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:30.869
but you won't be able to win
even in your wildest dreams!

00:11:30.869 --> 00:11:33.405
Nightmare Xyz lets
me overlay Dark monsters

00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:38.109
that are in my graveyard to
summon a new Xyz Monster!

00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:40.412
My new Number will
make Number 96

00:11:40.412 --> 00:11:44.382
seem like a paltry
puppet in comparison!

00:11:44.382 --> 00:11:45.383
(laughing)

00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:49.955
I now overlay two Umbral Horror
Ghosts and Will O' the Wisp

00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:51.389
in my graveyard!

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:54.893
With these three monsters I
build the Overlay Network

00:11:54.893 --> 00:11:57.796
to give rise to
your darkest fears!

00:11:57.796 --> 00:12:04.736
I Xyz Summon Number 43:
Manipulator of Souls!

00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:15.981
And your nightmare
doesn't end here!

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:19.251
It equips a Number
from my graveyard!

00:12:19.251 --> 00:12:24.256
I equip Number 96 onto
Manipulator of Souls!

00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:31.863
We can take anything
you dish out, Vector!

00:12:31.863 --> 00:12:33.398
But I'm not quite through yet.

00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:37.402
Next I activate Don Thousand's
Throne's effect!

00:12:37.402 --> 00:12:41.072
And I'm sure it is much
more than you bargained for!

00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:46.378
I regain life points equal to
the damage I took this turn!

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:53.525
And as I gain life points, your
hopes of beating me will drop!

00:12:54.386 --> 00:12:58.290
(groaning and screaming)

00:13:00.392 --> 00:13:03.862
(Vector) As does Nash's energy.

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:09.401
Manipulator of Souls' special
ability activates!

00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:12.203
Since I gained 1,000
life points,

00:13:12.203 --> 00:13:14.906
it gains 1,000 attack points!

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.878
And one of you loses
1,000 life points.

00:13:19.878 --> 00:13:21.413
What a pity!

00:13:21.413 --> 00:13:24.883
Now which one of you
lovelies should I blast?

00:13:24.883 --> 00:13:26.384
How about ladies first?

00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:30.388
Marin, you take
1,000 points of damage!

00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:32.190
Licking Lash!

00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:35.393
(screaming)

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.265
Marin!

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:41.399
I'm fine.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.701
I can take it.

00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:44.402
Oh, let's hope so...

00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:47.205
For your sake.

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:49.975
Vector's strategy
is formidable.

00:13:49.975 --> 00:13:52.410
He gets his life
points back every turn.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.347
But we don't, so it's only
a matter of time

00:13:55.347 --> 00:13:56.948
until he defeats us.

00:13:56.948 --> 00:13:58.383
(Vector)
They've missed
the best part.

00:13:58.383 --> 00:14:02.387
When I regain my life points,
I'm draining it from Nash!

00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:05.390
They don't know they're
hurting him instead of me!

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.127
If Vector regains all his life
points at the end of each turn,

00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:12.831
that just means we have to get
rid of all his life points

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:14.933
in a single turn!

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:19.871
Well, you can certainly try,
but right now it is my turn!

00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:21.039
I draw!

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:25.844
Manipulator of Souls,
attack Star Seraph Sentry!

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:38.990
Why would you destroy
your own monster?

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.325
Clearly you know nothing

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:46.297
of Manipulator of Souls'
special ability!

00:14:46.297 --> 00:14:51.069
When it's equipped with a
Number, it can't be destroyed.

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:54.906
But I bet you're wondering why
I intentionally took damage.

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:58.243
I chose to take damage because
that lets me activate

00:14:58.243 --> 00:15:00.879
the spell Card of Endurance!

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:04.315
I take 1,000 more points
of damage!

00:15:11.289 --> 00:15:15.927
But that's a small price
to pay to get to draw a card.

00:15:15.927 --> 00:15:20.398
I'll place two cards facedown
and end my turn!

00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:21.332
My turn may be over,

00:15:21.332 --> 00:15:25.403
but Don Thousand's Throne's
effect is just getting started,

00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:28.940
which means I get all my
life points back!

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:33.378
I'm good as new!

00:15:33.378 --> 00:15:36.381
And since I regained
2,500 life points,

00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:40.718
Manipulator of Souls
gains 2,500 attack points!

00:15:40.718 --> 00:15:45.790
And one of you two fools
loses 2,500 life points.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.959
So who will it be this time?

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.727
I think I'll choose
Marin again!

00:15:49.727 --> 00:15:53.865
Watching you suffer is my
new favorite hobby!

00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:55.700
(screaming)

00:15:58.403 --> 00:16:00.105
No!

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:07.412
Oh, Marin, you're
barely hanging on by a thread.

00:16:07.645 --> 00:16:10.014
One more blast and
you're through!

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:12.083
It's just like old times.

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.384
I destroyed you years ago,

00:16:13.618 --> 00:16:17.388
and now I have the pleasure
of destroying you again!

00:16:17.388 --> 00:16:19.390
Again?

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.225
Come now.

00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:22.660
You mean you don't remember?

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.928
Remember?

00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:27.999
I guess it's up to me to brush
the cobwebs off your brain.

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:30.135
Let's stroll down memory lane.

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:32.837
The memory lane of pain!

00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:34.205
Yes, Marin!

00:16:34.205 --> 00:16:35.340
Think back, dearie!

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.711
I'm the one who erased
you and Nash from existence!

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:41.412
(laughing)

00:16:41.412 --> 00:16:43.381
(all gasping)

00:16:44.716 --> 00:16:48.620
♪♪

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:53.258
Give up, Vector...

00:16:53.258 --> 00:16:54.092
You have lost!

00:16:54.092 --> 00:16:56.961
Let her go and I
may show you mercy!

00:16:56.961 --> 00:17:00.098
This animal deserves
no mercy, Nash!

00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:02.400
(Vector)
Quiet... both of you!

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.703
Say goodbye to your
sister, Nash!

00:17:05.703 --> 00:17:10.141
I activate the
trap Giant Sky Sword!

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:20.185
My sword sliced
the fabric of reality.

00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.387
If Marin happens to
fall in there,

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.722
she will never be getting out!

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:26.925
Let her go, Vector!

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:28.393
Excellent idea!

00:17:28.393 --> 00:17:29.394
Marin!

00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:30.795
(screaming)

00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:32.397
Marin!

00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.202
Marin!
Nash!

00:17:37.202 --> 00:17:41.806
Whatever this is, I
will never leave your side.

00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:50.248
Where are we?

00:17:50.248 --> 00:17:51.382
I am not sure.

00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:55.386
We are going straight
into that light!

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.396
I am and honored
to see you my Lord.

00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:06.397
(Dumon) Who are you?

00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.936
My name is Abyss, your servant,
come to save you both.

00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:12.971
But...

00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:13.404
But how?

00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:15.640
I will place your souls
in new vessels

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.010
and you will live again
in in the human world.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.246
The human world?

00:18:21.246 --> 00:18:21.713
But...

00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:25.383
I must tell you that you will
both lose all of your memories

00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:27.352
and only when we meet
each other again

00:18:27.352 --> 00:18:30.955
will your
memories begin to return.

00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:34.993
All right, Abyss.

00:18:34.993 --> 00:18:37.095
I am counting on you.

00:18:37.095 --> 00:18:40.198
♪♪

00:18:48.806 --> 00:18:50.675
I can't believe it!

00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:51.676
They're awake!

00:18:51.676 --> 00:18:53.144
It's a miracle!

00:18:55.246 --> 00:18:57.015
(laughing)

00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:57.882
(Dumon) Marin!

00:18:57.882 --> 00:19:00.785
I remember everything now.

00:19:00.785 --> 00:19:05.657
(Vector)
I have despised Nash from the
very moment I laid eyes on him!

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:10.862
Everything he did, every word he
spoke annoyed me to no end!

00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:14.399
I knew that one of us
would have to leave forever...

00:19:14.399 --> 00:19:16.401
Better him than me.

00:19:16.401 --> 00:19:18.269
But I vowed to eliminate him

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:20.405
only if he truly
got out of hand.

00:19:20.638 --> 00:19:25.243
So I devised a clever game,
a little "point system"

00:19:25.243 --> 00:19:26.744
if you will.

00:19:26.744 --> 00:19:29.113
Point system?

00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:30.048
Yes.

00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:32.917
Each time Nash
angered me, one point!

00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:36.387
Speak to me without bowing
first, one point!

00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:39.824
Reach a million
points and I would end him!

00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:42.260
But I never would have
imagined he would score

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.395
twice that in under two days!

00:19:44.395 --> 00:19:49.200
So I set about to strike at
Nash as viciously as I could...

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.938
And the bait was his
sister Marin!

00:19:53.938 --> 00:19:55.406
You fiend!

00:19:55.406 --> 00:19:57.408
When you two fell
into the abyss,

00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:01.412
I was certain you
were sunk for good!

00:20:01.412 --> 00:20:02.847
But you were wrong!

00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:06.284
We returned as the humans
Reginald and Rio Kastle.

00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:10.054
We met Yuma and his friends
and grew very close to them.

00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:12.357
But this tormented
Nash to no end.

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:14.892
As his memories of being
a Barian returned to him

00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:16.394
and his mission became clear,

00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:18.963
he was faced with the fact
that his best friends

00:20:18.963 --> 00:20:22.100
would soon become
his sworn enemies!

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.900
Oh, my!

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.069
However did poor
little Nash manage?

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:27.872
I've had enough of you, Vector!

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.078
(screaming)

00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:40.578
Alito, it's...

00:20:40.578 --> 00:20:43.221
Girag.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.392
(Marin) Vector!

00:20:47.392 --> 00:20:49.994
Your madness ends now!

00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:51.362
My turn!

00:20:51.362 --> 00:20:53.398
I draw!

00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:56.934
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
the Seventh One!

00:20:56.934 --> 00:21:01.639
I rank up Ragnazero
into a Chaos Xyz Monster!

00:21:08.613 --> 00:21:12.016
Appear, Chaos Number 103!

00:21:12.016 --> 00:21:14.318
Ragnafinity!

00:21:23.628 --> 00:21:25.363
Savor your final moments.

00:21:25.363 --> 00:21:28.166
I'm taking all the pain and
suffering you've caused

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:30.701
and sending it
rocketing back to you!

00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:32.937
This is goodbye, Vector!

00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:10.067
