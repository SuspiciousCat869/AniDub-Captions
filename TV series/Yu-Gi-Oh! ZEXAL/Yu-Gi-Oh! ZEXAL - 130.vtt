WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.237
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.536
(Yuma) Where are we?

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:09.905
It's... Alito!

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.908
(Alito)
You're not going
to save yourself!

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.743
Time to duel, Yuma.

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.713
I told you before I'm
not dueling with you!

00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:20.916
Maybe this will
change your mind...

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.585
(screaming)

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:24.753
Yuma!

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:25.788
All right.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:27.523
Let's duel!

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:28.924
(laughing)

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.392
I know what that is.

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:32.594
It is all becoming clear now...

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:36.532
The Barian Numbers were created
by Don Thousand.

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:39.401
And he is the
one controlling Alito!

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.769
Yuma, I have it!

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.806
I know a way to free Alito.

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:45.307

(Astral) Yuma, I have it!

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:50.673
I know a way to free Alito.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:51.874
Okay, I'm all ears!

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:54.710
How are we going
to do it, Astral?

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.612
Don Thousand told us himself.

00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:59.282
The moment we recovered
the Mythyrian Numbers...

00:01:59.282 --> 00:02:02.652
they could no longer seal
away his evil power,

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:05.688
allowing him to grow
stronger and stronger...

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.023
and he is now able to control

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.927
Alito's mind
through Comet Cestus.

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:13.062
So we helped Don Thousand?

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:15.765
We're the worst heroes ever!

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:16.766
Not so.

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:19.035
At least I hope not.

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:19.769
Yuma.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.037
Think back to the start.

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:25.041
Your father instructed us
to gather the Mythyrian Numbers,

00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:27.977
even if that meant freeing
Don Thousand.

00:02:27.977 --> 00:02:29.011
Why would he do that?

00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.049
I doubt he would mislead us or
intentionally put us in danger,

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.484
so he must have had
a good reason.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:38.020
And I believe
I know what it is.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.489
Your father anticipated
that we would battle

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.558
against the seven
Barian Emperors,

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.795
and as such, we would
be battling Don Thousand's

00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:48.030
seven evil Numbers.

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.299
So we needed some help.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:50.766
Correct.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:54.704
If the Mythyrian Numbers can
suppress Don Thousand's power,

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:55.538
then it is highly likely

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:58.975
that they can suppress those
Barian Numbers as well.

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:00.543
To put it more simply...

00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:04.914
We must beat Don Thousand's
Numbers with our Numbers.

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:05.648
Now I get it!

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:09.819
If we defeat Alito's Comet
Cestus with our Lion Heart,

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.956
we'll free him of
Don Thousand's control!

00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:17.893
All right...
Let's get to it!

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:18.661
But wait, Yuma.

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:22.331
We do not possess enough
monsters to summon Lion Heart.

00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.402
Nor do we have any cards in
our hand to help us do so.

00:03:26.402 --> 00:03:26.969
Yeah, I know.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.639
Which means everything
depends on our next draw...

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.040
But don't worry.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:36.579
(Yuma)
I won't lose as long as I got
friends worth fighting for!

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.881
Yuma.

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:39.615
Okay...

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:42.051
You'd never let me down.

00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:43.452
That's a fact!

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.422
And now get set to get decked!

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:54.864
I got the card I needed!

00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:59.001
I summon Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:02.972
Kuri!

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:06.575
Then I overlay my Level 1
Rainbow Kuriboh,

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.811
Kurivolt and Darklon!

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.681
With these three monsters, I
build the Overlay Network

00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:14.050
and Xyz Summon!

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.388
Let him hear you roar,
Number 54: Lion Heart!

00:04:19.388 --> 00:04:21.323
(roaring)

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.398
I remember that Number!

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.304
What's...

00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.839
What's happening?

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.484
Alito, play with me!

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:49.752
Me, me, me!

00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:50.853
You're so strong!

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:52.788
(Alito) Know why?

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:54.423
Because of you kids.

00:04:54.423 --> 00:04:55.958
You give me strength.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.326
(cheering)

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.564
(Boy) See you later, Alito.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:04.400
(man) Alito.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.035
Please be careful.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.036
Who are you?

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.773
Your life is in grave danger.

00:05:10.773 --> 00:05:11.540
Oh, yeah?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.808
What kind of danger?

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:16.779
The prince is jealous
of your popularity.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:17.513
That's a lie!

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:20.049
The prince is one
of my closest friends!

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:24.053
Do not be so certain.

00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:26.522
Hey, wait!

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.658
♪♪

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:34.063
(Alito) He's wrong.

00:05:34.263 --> 00:05:36.632
The prince isn't jealous of me.

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:40.803
Even if it's true... my Lion
Heart will protect me.

00:05:40.803 --> 00:05:43.405
Always has, always will.

00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:50.713
What's this?

00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:54.049
What do you want?

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.550
Alito...

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.988
I have here a warrant for your
arrest for acts of treason,

00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:03.058
signed by the prince.

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:04.693
No way!

00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.061
This is a mistake

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:07.062
Let me out

00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:09.899
Let me out!

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:12.034
(woman) Shame on you, Alito!

00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:13.369
You're no hero!

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:14.837
(man) Don't believe him!

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:15.771
He deserves it!

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:17.573
(man) Shame on you, Alito!

00:06:17.573 --> 00:06:19.475
(woman) You traitor!

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:21.377
Alito!

00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:22.511
You liar!

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:24.747
He's a bad guy!

00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:26.815
(man) I warned you, Alito

00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:28.350
I foresaw your fate.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.454
Betrayed by your friend,
the prince, falsely accused,

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:34.623
scorned by your people,

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.926
despised by all.

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:39.061
You fate is sealed!

00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:40.062
(Alito) He's right.

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:43.365
Not a single person
believes me!

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:43.999
And you.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:45.334
I thought you were my friend.

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:48.771
Now you've sentenced me to
be exiled for life.

00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.273
Well, I'll make
you pay for your lies!

00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:56.879
Someday, I will make you pay
for your actions.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.982
That... was... me!

00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:01.417
Astral, what's going on?

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.519
What's happening to Alito?

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:06.055
Lion Heart has triggered
his memories.

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:07.590
Our plan is working!

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.625
One final strike
to Comet Cestus

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:12.895
may break
Don Thousand's mind control!

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:17.900
Don Thousand!

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.869
I'm setting Alito free!

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:24.039
Now Lion Heart...
attack Comet Cestus!

00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:27.543
Lion Heart's special
ability activates!

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:30.412
Lion Heart won't be
destroyed in this battle,

00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:35.050
but that's not all When I
take damage, you do too!

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:40.389
Rhapsody in Berserk has
a special ability too!

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.057
By sending it to the graveyard,

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:46.061
this card slashes the damage
I'll take in half!

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:01.977
Yuma!

00:08:01.977 --> 00:08:04.480
Lion Heart's ability activates!

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.049
When all our life points
are gone...

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.485
By using one Overlay Unit...

00:08:09.485 --> 00:08:12.821
we regain 100 life points!

00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:15.057
Reviving Jolt!

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:20.329
Yuma!

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.531
Hey, thanks, Astral.

00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:26.001
Losing life points can
be pretty shocking.

00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:30.973
(Don Thousand) My power...

00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:34.743
My control
over Alito is fading!

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:37.880
And good riddance.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.052
Is it all over?

00:08:43.052 --> 00:08:45.821
What happened to me?

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:51.660
My mind...

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.363
It feels like
it's been set free.

00:08:54.363 --> 00:08:55.030
It has.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.600
Don Thousand was controlling
you, but we stopped him!

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.437
Don Thousand?

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:04.673
I see.

00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:05.407
Yuma...

00:09:05.407 --> 00:09:08.811
You freed me of his control...

00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:12.581
So shall I free your friend.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.554
Astral, he's back
to his old self!

00:09:18.554 --> 00:09:21.590
Yuma, stay where you are!

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.424
Why?

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.926
What's the matter?

00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:26.395
Our duel isn't over.

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:30.332
Not until I defeat you!

00:09:30.332 --> 00:09:31.033
Aww, man!

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:32.868
He's still brainwashed!

00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:33.302
No.

00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:35.437
These are not
Don Thousand's words

00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:36.405
They are my own.

00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:40.042
I may have been human once,
but I'm a Barian now!

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.778
And I fight to
defend Barian World.

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:47.049
You on the other hand fight
to destroy Barian World

00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:48.784
We are at odds.

00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:51.787
I must not allow you succeed.

00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:54.356
You remain my enemy.

00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:55.624
I see.

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:57.459
Yuma, Astral...

00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:59.328
This has been a great workout

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:00.896
I'm impressed you
went the distance

00:10:00.896 --> 00:10:04.032
with a real heavyweight, but
you're out of your league

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:07.569
and it's time to take
you down for the count!

00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:09.405
I don't wanna fight you!

00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:10.439
Let's end this!

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:13.041
The only way this duel
ends is with you losing!

00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.778
Since it sounds like you're
throwing in the towel,

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:19.047
I'll speed things up and
send you straight to your demise

00:10:19.047 --> 00:10:22.050
I activate Rhapsody in Berserk's
special ability!

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:27.489
It's coming out of retirement to
knock you out once and for all!

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:33.061
Your end begins now,

00:10:33.295 --> 00:10:38.033
with the return of Number 80:
Rhapsody in Berserk!

00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:44.039
Now, I activate
Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force!

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:51.513
With this one monster, I
rebuild the Overlay Network.

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:54.950
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:05.761
Rise up, Chaos Number 80:
Requiem In Berserk

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.376
And Barian's Force
has another effect!

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.377
My Rhapsody in Berserk

00:11:22.377 --> 00:11:25.047
steals all of your monster's
Overlay Units

00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:28.650
and then, it sets you up to
be brought down because

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.322
your monster loses 300 attack
points per Overlay Unit!

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:37.426
Lion Heart doesn't have
any more Overlay Units left!

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:41.697
Without them, it
cannot restore our life points!

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:43.031
Don't be too upset yet.

00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:45.534
Save some of your panic
because things

00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:47.035
are about to get much worse.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:50.339
I use Requiem in Berserk's
special ability.

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.040
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:56.345
all your spell and trap
cards are banished!

00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:57.646
Last but not least,

00:11:57.646 --> 00:12:00.582
Requiem in Berserk has
one final trick for you!

00:12:00.582 --> 00:12:05.053
I'm going to equip it on to my
Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus

00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:08.657
to give it 2,000
more attack points.

00:12:17.432 --> 00:12:18.033
But why?

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.435
Why increase the monster's
attack points?

00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:23.705
You will take the same
amount of damage that we take.

00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:26.575
That will lead you to
your own demise!

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:27.576
I think not.

00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:30.045
You are the only ones
who will be defeated.

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:34.816
Requiem in Berserk wipes out
Lion Heart's special abilities,

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:37.986
so I won't be taking
any damage!

00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:39.054
No way!

00:12:39.054 --> 00:12:42.758
Comet Cestus attack Lion Heart!

00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.026
Use a trap, Yuma!

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:47.729
You don't have any trap
cards left on your field!

00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:49.665
So what?

00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:53.035
I'm activating a trap
from my graveyard!

00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:55.537
I play Dimensional U-Turn!

00:12:55.537 --> 00:12:56.498
What?

00:12:56.498 --> 00:13:00.499
By banishing this card,
I can banish my monster!

00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:04.693
I banish Lion Heart!

00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:10.465
What did you do that for?

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:14.369
Now you're left wide
open for my attack!

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:14.770
Don't think so!

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.706
Not with Rainbow Kuriboh's
special ability!

00:13:17.706 --> 00:13:20.409
It will protect me
from your direct attack!

00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:23.011
Come on out, Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.680
Kuri, Kuri!

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.280
Fine

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.084
Then I'll destroy
your little friend!

00:13:29.084 --> 00:13:30.485
Kuri, Kuri!

00:13:32.754 --> 00:13:35.624
Thanks, Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:13:35.624 --> 00:13:37.759
Little pest!

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:39.594
I end my turn.

00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:44.232
Dimensional U-Turn
has one more effect.

00:13:44.232 --> 00:13:48.136
It's bringing Lion Heart
back on the prowl!

00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:53.175
I found a way to
survive that turn...

00:13:53.175 --> 00:13:53.775
but what now, Astral?

00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:57.412
Even though we broke him free of
Don Thousand's mind control,

00:13:57.412 --> 00:13:59.214
Alito's still fightin' mad

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:03.618
No wonder Don Thousand
wanted him on his goon squad!

00:14:03.618 --> 00:14:05.754
Don Thousand wanted him...

00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:10.125
The legends at the ruins all
told of pure and noble souls,

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.094
it is hard to believe
that such heroes

00:14:12.094 --> 00:14:17.399
would willingly become Barian
Emperors and serve Don Thousand.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.734
Why could that have happened?

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:23.171
Did they really choose
to join the Barians?

00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:23.772
Of course not.

00:14:23.772 --> 00:14:27.442
They were tricked into making
that decision by Don Thousand!

00:14:27.442 --> 00:14:29.745
Uh, care to share there, buddy?

00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:30.679
Listen...

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:34.116
You must use Lion Heart
to destroy Comet Cestus!

00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:34.750
Are you for real?

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.552
You know Lion Heart
isn't strong enough for that?

00:14:37.552 --> 00:14:38.687
How am I supposed to...

00:14:38.687 --> 00:14:40.756
That will unlock more memories

00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:41.623
He will learn!

00:14:41.623 --> 00:14:42.758
Learn how he was tricked!

00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:45.293
You're not thinking
this through!

00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:46.361
Oh, boy.

00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:49.431
You sound like me.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.766
Frightening.

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:52.467
Hey!

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:56.738
Yuma, this battle will
be won or lost on this draw!

00:14:56.738 --> 00:15:00.609
Then I'd better...
feel the flow!

00:15:01.343 --> 00:15:02.344
Aww, yeah!

00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:03.745
Do it, Yuma!

00:15:03.745 --> 00:15:04.312
All right.

00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:08.750
I equip my Lion Heart with
the spell Emperor's Armor!

00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:12.308
Now when Lion Heart
attacks, its attack points

00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:17.240
become the same as your monster
that it's battling against!

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.179
Yuma, the moment we have been
fighting for is finally at hand.

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:26.716
Now Don Thousand's Number
will be destroyed!

00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:47.831
Yuma, Astral!

00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:49.233
You can do it!

00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:50.134
Okay!

00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:51.435
Go Lion Heart!

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:53.704
Attack Comet Cestus!

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.343
Why are you doing this?

00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:02.312
Your Lion Heart will
be destroyed also!

00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:10.354
Hey, you just
worry about yourself!

00:16:10.354 --> 00:16:13.423
I'll do anything to take down
your Battlin' Boxer

00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:16.426
Comet Cestus, Alito!

00:16:16.426 --> 00:16:18.262
You'll have to be
more clever than that

00:16:18.262 --> 00:16:20.430
if you wanna destroy
my monster!

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.001
Because by sending Requiem
in Berserk to the graveyard,

00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:27.905
my Comet Cestus avoids
the big TKO!

00:16:32.876 --> 00:16:37.047
Now only your monster is
going down for the ten count!

00:16:37.047 --> 00:16:38.015
Not happening!

00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:40.751
I activate
Emperor Armor's effect!

00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.052
By sending it to the graveyard,

00:16:42.052 --> 00:16:46.924
Lion Heart isn't
destroyed either!

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:48.425
But there's more in store

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:51.094
Its attack points
switch with yours,

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.430
and Lion Heart
can attack again!

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.432
This can't be!

00:16:55.432 --> 00:17:00.304
(both)
Now, Lion Heart,
finish Comet Cestus!

00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:14.451
Alito...

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:18.121
I have here a warrant for your
arrest for acts of treason,

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.123
signed by the prince.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:20.857
Treason?

00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:22.826
This must be some
kind of mistake...

00:17:22.826 --> 00:17:24.328
The prince is my friend!

00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:27.331
Take him!
Let me go!

00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:30.400
Your accusations about my
friend are totally ridiculous!

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.437
Alito and I, we are
like brothers!

00:17:33.437 --> 00:17:35.172
I told them.

00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:36.273
He is a true hero.

00:17:36.273 --> 00:17:42.145
When I am gone, he will be
the next ruler of this empire.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.381
And so I order you to free him.

00:17:44.381 --> 00:17:47.784
(man)
No...
I think not.

00:17:47.784 --> 00:17:49.419
Who are you?

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:52.289
My name is Don Thousand.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:57.294
It's the man who warned me!

00:17:57.294 --> 00:18:00.731
Yes...
I am one and the same,

00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:03.433
the deity who rules
Barian World

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:09.139
I require your indomitable soul,
your boundless fighting spirit!

00:18:09.139 --> 00:18:13.443
It will nourish me, strengthen
me, make me invincible!

00:18:13.443 --> 00:18:19.383
Yours is a power I can never
allow Astral World to possess!

00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:24.021
And this is why I shall
replace your memories

00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:26.023
with ones of my own design.

00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:28.158
You will remember none of this.

00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:29.426
Your deepest rooted memory

00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:31.962
will be your allegiance
to Barian World,

00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:34.298
your thirst to
destroy Astral World,

00:18:34.298 --> 00:18:38.702
and your betrayal at the hands
of the prince!

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.438
Get him out of my sight!

00:18:41.438 --> 00:18:44.007
It's all coming back to me...

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.114
Every painful memory...

00:18:56.753 --> 00:18:58.689
Alito...

00:18:58.689 --> 00:19:00.257
Alito!

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:07.431
Alito, are you all right?

00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:08.432
I just...

00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:09.966
My memories...

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:12.002
are they really real?

00:19:12.002 --> 00:19:13.103
Yes, Alito.

00:19:13.103 --> 00:19:15.439
Your real memories
have returned.

00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:18.975
Everything I
thought I knew was a lie.

00:19:18.975 --> 00:19:21.445
Hey, it's okay.

00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:22.145
Oh no...

00:19:22.145 --> 00:19:24.815
I did terrible things
to you and your friends

00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:26.450
that I can never undo.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.386
You must not blame
yourself, Alito.

00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:30.954
It is not your fault.

00:19:30.954 --> 00:19:32.189
Don Thousand tricked you,

00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:34.424
manipulating your past
experiences

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.426
so that you
would serve his needs.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.430
How we behave today is the
culmination of our actions

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.365
of the past,

00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:44.434
and yours were not
of your own free will.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.703
But that doesn't change
what I did.

00:19:46.703 --> 00:19:50.107
(Yuma)
Then you should
make up for it now!

00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:54.444
We sure could use
your help, Alito.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:54.878
Yuma....

00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:57.447
I'd like to crush Don Thousand
as much as you would,

00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:00.384
but as a Barian,
it is you I must defeat!

00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.419
But we can work together first.

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:03.854
C'mon, whaddaya say?

00:20:03.854 --> 00:20:07.424
That is a very
interesting idea, Yuma.

00:20:09.426 --> 00:20:12.028
Even though Barian World
is the mortal enemy

00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:13.697
of your precious Astral World,

00:20:13.697 --> 00:20:17.033
it may make sense for us
to defeat our common foe,

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.835
Don Thousand, first!

00:20:18.835 --> 00:20:19.369
Let's do it!

00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:22.372
(Astral)
But what about
the other Emperors?

00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:25.842
Don Thousand will not take
this defeat lightly.

00:20:25.842 --> 00:20:27.444
He will strike against them.

00:20:27.677 --> 00:20:30.180
We gotta find Don Thousand
and fast!

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.449
Vector will lead
us straight to him.

00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:33.417
Vector?

00:20:33.417 --> 00:20:35.118
That is most intriguing.

00:20:35.118 --> 00:20:37.387
Then let's get
this show on the road.

00:20:37.387 --> 00:20:38.755
You beat me to it, Yuma.

00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:41.158
Our next stop is Barian World!

00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:44.428
There we shall find Vector!

00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:45.990
Yuma took down Alito!

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.356
(Don Thousand)
We must seize the powers of the
other five Emperors

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:52.683
before Yuma and
Astral get to them as well!

00:20:52.683 --> 00:20:55.119
I'm on my way!

00:20:59.523 --> 00:21:01.720
(Vector)
Look who we
have here!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.754
Marin...

00:21:02.754 --> 00:21:03.355
Dumon!

00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:08.960
Vector, what
are you doing here?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.697
Why, I've come for something
you have that I want...

00:21:12.697 --> 00:21:13.965
Your powers!

00:21:13.965 --> 00:21:14.966
(laughing)

00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:15.967
(Dumon) Our powers?

00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.099
What are you talking about?

00:21:18.099 --> 00:21:20.635
So sorry, my apologies.

00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:22.149
Where is my head at?

00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:24.184
I need to be much
clearer, don't I?

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:26.086
You see I'll be absorbing
your powers,

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:28.388
all in the name
of Don Thousand!

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:29.790
Isn't that lovely?

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.258
Don Thousand?

00:21:31.258 --> 00:21:32.325
No!

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:35.395
(cackling)

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.056
