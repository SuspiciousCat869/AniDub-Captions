WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.730
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.130
Kite: Have you
two found Hart yet?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.090
Dextra: You brother was
detected on the roof of the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.260
windmill tower
located in the bay area.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.090
He's with a boy
named Yuma Tsukumo.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.590
Alright, tell me Hart is.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.360
Yuma: Kite,
I tried to tell them.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.930
The guy you sent came in a
chopper to pick up your brother.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.830
I didn't send anyone
to pick him up.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.230
Vetrix: Good.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.330
We can start the ritual now.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.790
Finally the moment has come!

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.690
I will drain Hart's power
from him and make it mine!

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.030
My plan for revenge can at
long last be fulfilled!

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.390
With my new Power, dr.
Faker will have no chance!

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.130
Quattro: If it isn't
the infamous Kite.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.690
What an honor.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.530
Are you the ones
who took my brother?

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.890
Where is he?

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.690
Relax, no harm has come to him.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.160
At least not yet.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.960
What's that mean?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.390
If you want to save the kid,
you don't have any choice!

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.930
You'll have to
get past us first.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.360
Astral: This will be...

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.190
a tag team duel!

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.630

TOGETHER: Let's do this!

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.090
You'll soon be humiliated
like my other fans.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.730
I'm no fan.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.260
I just want to win
this duel and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.430
get my little
brother out of here.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.460
Keep dreaming, Kite.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.260
I could best you guys even if I
kept this hand behind my back.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.460
why don't you give
your mouth a rest, too?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.860
Let's duel!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.130
Do not allow
him to provoke you.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.130
That is quattro's strategy.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.430
Yeah, I know.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.090
If we lose our cool,
then he's gonna win.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.660
Orbital 7: You wanna win?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.290
Then lay low,
you meddling pest

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.660
and stay out of
master Kite's way!

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.960
Tori: What was that?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.060
Yuma doesn't have
half the skills of Kite.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.530
Is that so?

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830
Well... he doesn't...

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.760
don't insult my friend or
I'll cut off your power supply!

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490
You got that?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.060
Er... Yes, ma'am.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.960
This girl is a real
pain in the processor.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.360
It's on!

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.190
I'm up first!

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.830
I summon gimmick
puppet egg head!

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.060
I activate its special ability.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.290
Once per turn, egg head lets me
send one card in my hand to my

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.430
graveyard so I can deal 800

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.930
points of damage.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.330
He's not allowed to do that!

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.590
True he cannot attack on the
first turn of a tag duel,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.890
but this is not an attack.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.790
I send my gimmick Puppet
dreary doll to the graveyard!

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.160
Do your damage and clobber Kite!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.430
You okay?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.030
Worry about yourself.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.590
Not a chance. We're
on the same team!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.960
I end my turn with a facedown!

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.460
Now, it's your move, Kite.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.130
But don't mess
this up or who knows

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.390
what may happen to your brother?

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.730
That's it.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.290
You're goin' down, quattro!

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.090
I'm activating the
field spell photon world.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.490
Hold on!

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.790
We're dueling in outer-Space?

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.460
But that means...

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.130
No oxygen!

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.730
Take a deep breath, would you?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.460
Next up, I'll
summon photon crusher!

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.690
Now due to my photon world, if I
summon a photon monster, anyone

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.130
who doesn't have one on their

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.490
field gets hit with damage equal
to my monster's level multiplied

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.060
by a hundred!

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.290
What?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.560
Hang on a second.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.060
I don't have a
photon monster out!

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.490
I'll be taking
damage just like them!

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.460
It doesn't matter
since I don't need you.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.690
I can rescue Hart all by myself.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.030
Dueling in space can be risky.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.230
Especially during
a meteor storm!

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.960
Kite!

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.760
How dare you injure
your own teammate!

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.360
No sense of loyalty.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.090
I admire that!

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.130
I'll put one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.760
You just sold me out!

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.130
Alright!

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.290
Then I'm not gonna
worry about you either!

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.660
Yes you will.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.030
In order to win this duel
you must work together.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.530
Tell that to Kite!

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.390
He started it you know!

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.060
Think, yuma.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.590
There is much more at
stake here than your pride.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.160
Remember you are
dueling for Hart.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.430
You're right.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.460
I promised to help him
and I can't let him down.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.030
I forgot.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.690
It's hopeless, yuma.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.160
Neither of you will save Hart
because you're both fools.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.960
You're a twerp.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.490
And Kite's a reluctant warrior
who was pressured into fighting

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.190
to save his little brother.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.530
Isn't it True, Kite?

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.730
That dr. Faker and Mr.
Heartland promised you they

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.290
would cure Hart's illness if
you served them by collecting

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.630
numbers?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.530
I was right.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.130
You do hunt numbers
to help cure Hart!

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.560
It's True!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.860
Kite May seem tough and
ruthless, But the truth is he's

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.930
really just desperate.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.890
He'd do anything to save
his precious brother!

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.130
The story's so
tragic, I could cry.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.630
You should've told us, Kite.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.030
Why did you keep it a secret?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.030
I don't want
your sympathy, yuma.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.660
All that matters to me is

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.060
collecting the
number cards I need.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.990
And I'll take yours
when I get the chance.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.890
He's hunting
numbers to cure Hart.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.230
But he can't if we gather
all the numbers instead.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.530
Yuma!

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.330
Keep your focus on this duel.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.860
If you lose now,
there will be

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.890
no hope for Hart
under any circumstance.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.990
Yeah you're right.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.590
Stay focused.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.860
I'm next!

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.260
I draw!

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.330
Quattro, I'm gonna
set up the combo.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.290
First I'm playing
chronomaly golden jet!

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.460
Next up, I activate my
chronomaly Resonance spell card!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.460
Using this spell, I can summon
another chronomaly Monster whose

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.430
level is one greater
than my chronomaly jet!

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.530
Rise up, chronomaly moai!

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.230
And now, I'll activate
golden jet's special ability!

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.190
With it, golden
jet gains one level!

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.030
So he has two level
five monsters now.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.090
I overlay my level 5 moai

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.630
and my golden jet!

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.130
And with that I can now build
the overlay network and Xyz

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.030
summon number 33...
Chronomaly machu mech!

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:50.090
I never saw a monster that
needed its own zip code before.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.000
My machu Mech is gonna
wreck your life points!

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.790
With machu mech in play, I'll
end my turn with two facedowns!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.030
Your move.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.760
That thing's ginormous!

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.430
Remember that
Trey and quattro

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.060
possess other
numbers as Well, yuma.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.190
You must keep your guard up.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.860
Don't worry, I will.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.060
Get ready.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.890
I draw!

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.160
I summon ganbara Knight!

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.690
And since I summoned
a level 4 monster,

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.860
I can also summon
out this guy!

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.730
C'mon out kagetokage!

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.660
I'm really
feelin' the flow!

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.890
I overlay level 4
ganbara Knight and kagetokage!

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.760
And now that I have,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.430
I can build the overlay
network and xyz summon!

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.660
Please!

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.860
Without a number you're
wasting your time.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.060
Well then quattro, since time
is of the essence, say hello to

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.330
number 39: Utopia!

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.060
He has...

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.130
a number?

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.190
Quinton: How interesting.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.460
This can't be!

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.690
How could that twerp
get a number card?

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.490
I wish I'd known that before.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.030
Hey quattro,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.890
I'm worried this kid may be able
to see through our strategy.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.590
He did watch my duel
against shark, after all.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.190
Maybe we should
change our game plan.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.990
Quattro!

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.990
That's quite the surprise.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.830
But know that an
even bigger surprise

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.060
is in store for you, yuma!

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.930
Yuma, place a card facedown.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.490
Quattro and Trey are very

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.390
skilled and you
must fortify your defenses.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.890
Stay alert.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.490
You must be ready for any
scenario they throw at you.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.960
You got it.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.590
I end my turn with
two facedown cards.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.460
It's my move now!

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.330
You better hold
on to your decks!

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.890
Because I'm activating my
level Doubler spell card!

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.930
Now by sending one card in my
hand to the graveyard, I can

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.190
double the level of my monster!
I think I'll send another

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.930
gimmick Puppet dreary doll to
the graveyard to give egg head

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.990
an egg-Stra boost!

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.490
And since I have two dreary
dolls in my graveyard, I can

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:36.130
banish one. And bring the
other one back to my field!

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.260
Quattro is clearly
setting the stage,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.830
so a number card
can be unleashed!

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.390
I overlay level 8 gimmick
puppet egg head and dreary doll!

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.560
I xyz summon number 15...
Gimmick puppet giant grinder!

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.030
Number 15!

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.930
That thing is powerful.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.760
Yuma, this situation
is most alarming.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.360
I've seen that number!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.730
Quattro used it before to

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.890
destroy bronk and
Caswell's monsters!

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.330
Time for me to step in and

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.830
activate my number
Wall trap card!

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.690
My number is now protected so
there's no way you can destroy

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.660
it with any spells,
traps or special abilities.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.390
A trap that shields his number!

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.060
It's totally invincible.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.960
Yuma, this is bad.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.060
Your number is up, kid!

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.230
I activate giant
grinder's ability!

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.160
Now by using one overlay unit,
giant grinder can destroy every

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.030
other xyz monster!

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:15.090
Say Bye-Bye to utopia!

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.660
Hold up!

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.190
Using That ability will destroy
your teammate's number, also!

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.660
Wrong, kid.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.130
Number wall will
shield my monster,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.890
so it won't get destroyed.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.560
Your utopia won't
be so lucky, though!

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.230
Trey and quattro
played this perfectly.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.460
I am afraid there is nothing
we can do to save utopia.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.960
Are you sure?

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.490
Number 15 is
simply too powerful.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.690
Utopia's destruction
is unavoidable.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.190
What about its special ability?

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.460
No good.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.090
It is hopeless.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.630
No!

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.560
It gets a whole lot worse.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.190
Gimmick puppet giant grinder's

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.360
gonna deal even
more damage... to you!

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.990
You're taking damage equal
to utopia's attack points!

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.790
Yuma, are you okay?

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.290
Watch out!

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.330
Giant Grinder has
1500 attack points.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.790
If quattro attacks you with it,
then you will lose and Kite

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.290
will be alone.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.590
Yuma, you must
summon damage mage.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.260
Yeah, good idea!

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.930
I'm playing damage
mage in defense mode!

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.790
Whenever a special ability harms
me, I can summon damage mage!

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.530
It restores my life points back
to where they were before you

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.990
used your ability!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.560
You spoiled my plan,
you little twerp!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.790
But don't think you stopped
me, go attack gimmick!

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.360
Thanks to this, giant grinder
gets 500 more attack points

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.030
until the end of the turn, so it

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.730
can really Lash
out at its enemies!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.130
And then, if my powered up
gimmick puppet GIANT Grinder

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.990
destroys your monster in battle,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.730
you take damage equal to the
destroyed monster's attack

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.260
points Which is bad news!

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.730
And that bad news is
comin' your way, Kite!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:28.560
Giant grinder, eliminate
Kite's photon crusher!

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.360
But since they have
the same attack points,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.930
they'll both be destroyed!

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.990
No, that giant
grinder is a number.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.960
Only another number
can destroy it.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.130
Giant grinder, attack!

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.260
Kite, I'm gonna crush
your photon crusher.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Then I'll crush you!

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:54.160
Say goodbye to
your photon crusher!

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.460
No!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.060
Master Kite!

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.630
Feel like giving
up yet, Kite?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.260
No one's giving up 'cause I
activated imtrable attack to

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.090
protect my partner.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.090
A trap card?

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.890
That's right.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.690
See, since I activated this
trap, I was able keep Kite's

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.330
monster from being destroyed!

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.460
And since photon crusher
survived, Kite did not take any

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.090
damage either.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.890
You're starting to
get on my nerves, kid.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.060
I end my turn.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.130
Yuma, do you think I need
your help to survive?

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.730
I'm just tryin' to
be a good teammate.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.060
What an ingrate!

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.890
And yuma just
saved his monster!

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.430
Sorry, but saying "Thank you"
isn't master Kite's style.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.690
Don't help me.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.530
We'll always be
enemies, yuma.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.060
Anyone with a number card
will be taken down by me.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.530
Hold on.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.060
You're doing this for astral.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.230
You're wrong!

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.460
That's not True!

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.660
I know you plan to carry out

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.230
your mission no
matter what I do!

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.890
I told you, I made
a promise to Hart!

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.660
Hart wanted to see his big
brother again, and I swore that

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.290
I'd bring both
of you back together!

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.330
Will you two stop?

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.430
You're supposed to be
fighting me, not each other!

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.560
I do not appreciate
being ignored!

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.060
What's the matter with you guys?

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.130
Don't you find me
threatening enough?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.790
I just find him obnoxious.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.660
I have an idea.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.590
This'll get your focus on me.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.930
I'll give you both an inside
look... at poor, helpless Hart!

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.560
Feast your eyes on this!

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.460
Brother!

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.130
Oh, no!

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.660
Let my brother go now!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.260
That's not gonna happen.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.690
By the time we're finished, it
will be too late To help Hart.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.490
He may not even recognize you
once we're through with him.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.460
You animal!

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.190
Don't push it.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.360
What's the matter?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.460
Oh wait!

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.930
You must be feeling guilty.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.290
You know you don't have what it
takes to win this duel and save

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.190
your little brother!

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.990
Quattro!

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.530
Do it, Kite!

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.360
use the card I've
been waiting for.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.830
then your brother's fate will
be sealed and so will yours!

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.290
You are through, quattro!

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.890
Think about what
you're doing, Kite!

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.090
First I'll summon
photon Thrasher!

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.460
By Summoning photon Thrasher,

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.430
photon world's
effect is activated!

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.660
You should've turned Hart over

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.330
when you had
the chance, quattro!

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.230
I'll keep hammering away till
you're forced to release him!

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:03.190
Nothing's gonna stop me
from freeing my brother!

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.390
I'll destroy anybody
who stands in my way.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.030
Chill out.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.760
With two powerful
monsters on his field,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.390
Kite is now prepared
to make his move.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.730
I tribute my photon crusher
and photon Thrasher!

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:21.530
So that I can bring out one of
my most destructive monsters.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.060
Be afraid, quattro!

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.790
Come, my mighty monster!

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.590
With the
savagery of a supernova!

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.130
Bring on a cosmic
cataclysm that

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.590
vaporizes
everything in your path!

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.430
Come forth,
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.030
Stupendous!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.530
Are you sure this was a
good idea, quattro?

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.460
Kite doesn't have a
clue what's coming.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.060
Trust me.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.730
I hope this works,
for our sakes.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.190
Oh no!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.430
Since Kite summoned
another photon monster,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.860
photon world's effect activates!

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.490
Galaxy-Eyes, take aim!

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.830
Attack Giant grinder!

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.160
Go photon stream of destruction!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.860
Kite fell for it!

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.960
I activate the trap,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.860
stonehenge shield!

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.530
If you attack with a monster
with 3000 or more attack points,

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.160
this card not only deflects your

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.130
attack, But your
monster's attack points

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.790
Get zapped down to zero!

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.290
Zero?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.190
Yes and it loses all of
its special abilities!

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.930
Your galaxy-Eyes is now
completely powerless.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.730
It's too weak to put
up any kind of fight.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.790
Those two wanted Kite
to summon galaxy-Eyes.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.360
They set him up!

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.090
Machu mech, use
your special ability!

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.530
By Using one overlay unit,
you take damage equal to the

00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.960
difference in your monster's

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.390
previous and
current attack points.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.090
Go infinity Cannon!

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.360
Ready, aim, fire!

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.690
Thanks for the duel Kite,
it was fun while it lasted.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.490
Now say goodbye to your
Dragon's attack points.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:23.490
And get ready... to say
good-Bye to your life points!

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.000
Kite! No!
