00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
(Yuma)
Last time on
"YuGiOh ZEXAL"...

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.173
(both) Let's Duel!

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:12.446
I possess the combined power of
all the fallen Barian Emperors!

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.716
Come to me!

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.154
Whoa!

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.356
Vector's power is off
the charts!

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:26.760
Unending strength courses
through every atom of my being!

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:31.598
King Overfiend attack
Masquerade!

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.974
Nash destroyed the Number that
Don Thousand gave to Vector.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:45.078
Now Vector will regain
the true memories of his past!

(man) People of Ostrania!

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:59.019
On this most glorious of days,
our prince has been born!

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.621
Long live Lord Vector!

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:06.093
May he grow to inherit an
era of peace and prosperity!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.695
Prosperity♪

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.663
And peace...

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.765
My child will not grow
to inherit anything

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.068
with our resources dwindling
and the neighboring kingdoms

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.270
taxing us too much...

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.739
Peace is a dream...

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.208
War is the reality.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:26.580
For the glory of our people,
we must show no mercy!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.748
Attack!

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:31.284
Leave no village unplundered!

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.087
Annihilate everything
in your path!

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.288
Show them our power!

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:38.291
We will not stop until we have
conquered everything

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.627
beneath the sky!

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.298
(man) The king has collapsed!

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:51.104
Vector... Your father has
fallen ill from exhaustion.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.474
He is no longer able to
rule our kingdom.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.742
The vassals have convened

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:59.179
and agree that you
must ascend to the throne.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.415
Are you prepared to lead us♪

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.550
Yes...
I am ready.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:08.422
People of Ostrania...
Hear me.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.391
The time has come for peace.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.760
No longer will we wage war...

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.264
The days of aggression
and fear are over.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:20.667
The future of
Ostrania is ours to create!

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.636
Together, as one!

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.738
(cheering)

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.343
What is the
meaning of this nonsense♪

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:35.615
Is it true you invited the other
regents to a peace summit♪

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.384
Yes.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.618
You fool...

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.420
How could y...

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.488
How could you.

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:45.125
We're one step from
taking Fandorn completely!

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.593
Fandorn is not ours to take.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:50.764
And I won't ask any more of our
people to fall in the name of...

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.099
Silence!

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.467
That is enough!

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:53.833
No more.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.670
You will tell your generals
to advance on Fandorn

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.107
and destroy
everything in their path!

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.374
I will not.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.744
Then you are a
disgrace to your kingdom,

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.746
to your people and to me.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:09.416
You are not fit
to carry my blade.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.118
I banish you.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.120
No...

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.022
My son!

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.290
Mother!

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.595
My king, I will not
let you banish our son.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:25.766
You don't have...

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.735
(Don Thousand) Don't you see♪

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.670
Who...
Who're you♪

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.572
I am Don Thousand.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.507
I came to help.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:36.743
To open your eyes
and show you the truth.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:39.679
The peace you seek is
an illusion...

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:44.284
Look at how it tears
your family apart...

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.754
You will listen to
the rage inside you.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.757
You will trust no one
but yourself.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:54.094
I will take up this blade.
You will
take up that blade.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.763
I will finish what
my father could not...

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.267
I will conquer everything
and everyone,

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.470
eliminating all
who stand in my way.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.480
Can someone tell me
what we just saw♪

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.748
Were those his memories♪

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:17.617
Apparently, as with
the other Emperors...

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.620
he was manipulated
by Don thousand.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.191
(Vector) No...

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.493
It's impossible...

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.127
What've I done...

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:31.264
All the destruction I caused,
the people that I've hurt...

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.700
How could I♪

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.605
Don thousand!

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:42.742
You became the person
you were destined to become.

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.644
All because of you!

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.313
You manipulated me!

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:50.984
Just as I manipulated
your fool of a father.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.687
Oh, man...

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.189
It's awful.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.059
(screaming)

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:02.762
You gotta keep it together!

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:06.299
What happened
wasn't your fault, Vector.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.469
You're a good guy,
I know you are!

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.739
Remember the guy who showed
me all those shortcuts to school

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.642
and taught me how to
burp the alphabet♪

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.644
That guy was awesome!

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:20.647
And that's who you really are.

00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:22.749
I know it is!

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.750
Is that true♪

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.052
Is there really good in me♪

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.755
(Don Thousand)
How little
you understand...

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.524
Young Vector claimed
to want peace...

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:36.730
But that was an attempt to quiet
the rage boiling inside him.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.299
That rage was always there...

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:41.735
I just helped him awaken it.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.104
You didn't help
him to do anything!

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:47.741
All you did was get in his
head and mess him up.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.110
It does not matter.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.112
He is who he is.

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:56.616
His actions cannot be erased.

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.717
He's right.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.754
I can't change
the person I've become.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:01.755
Not true!

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.757
It can be like
a do-over.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.591
(Tori) Right!

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:09.763
You can't change the past,
but you can control your future!

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.765
That's a nice thought.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.767
If only it were true.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.702
It is true!

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:16.603
You don't get it.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.739
I can't control
the future because...

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:24.044
There is no future for me.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.745
I activate...

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.747
Xyz Discharge!

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.750
Nash, by discarding a card
from your hand,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.588
you can gain control
of all my Xyz Monsters.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:36.690
What♪

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.191
Why are you doing this♪

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.760
Because... this is
what I deserve.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.764
Now you can use all my
monsters to finish me off Nash!

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.766
No!

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.602
You can take out
Don thousand right now...

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.271
by taking me out!

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.439
How dare you!

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.708
You must not hesitate, Shark!

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.643
Hesitate, hesitate!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.744
Yuma...

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:58.244
It's fine.

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:02.415
I deserve to be consumed by the
shadows and totally forgotten.

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.751
I will not allow this!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.155
You ungrateful wretch!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:13.426
Defeat me, while I've
still got him under control!

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.096
It's now or never!

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:23.737
Defeat me, while I've
still got him under control!

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:25.672
It's now or never!

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.674
What are you waiting for?

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:31.044
Beat me!

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.179
As you wish.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.714
Shark!

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:37.484
To take advantage
of your Xyz Discharge,

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:40.420
I'm discarding Dream Shark
from my hand.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.758
In doing so, I gain
control of all of your monsters

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:49.329
Yes!

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.131
Now finish this!

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.532
No way, Shark!

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.767
Don't do it.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:55.035
Yuma...

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.736
It's the only way...

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.005
Don't say that!

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.106
Ray!

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.274
Now, Nash!

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.209
Finish me!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.278
Ragnafinity...

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.113
Stop it!

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.282
Attack Vector!

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:16.423
No, Ray!

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:25.765
I activate my trap,
Trick Buster!

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:30.603
Since my field is empty, Trick
Buster can block your attack...

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.406
But that's not all it can do.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.177
Those awesome monsters of
mine that you took control of♪

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.312
They're all goin'
bye-bye!

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.182
Along with King Overfiend!

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.120
Ta-da!

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:57.197
But... why♪

00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.265
That was incredible!

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.433
What is going on♪

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.736
I duped you all with
my amazing performance!

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.339
Maybe I should've
been an actor.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.743
The way I managed
to fool you all!

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:11.744
You guys!

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.379
Talk about being gullible!

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.982
You actually fell for
the 'poor me' bit!

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.750
It's priceless!

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.687
Not cool.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:21.754
And now...

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:23.756
Dear Nash...

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.759
It's time to join your
friends in oblivion!

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.595
But you won't be going solo.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:32.432
There's also this pesky deity
I've gotta get rid of.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.001
What are you
talking about, Vector♪

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:35.735
We're done, big guy.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.638
You actually thought you
were using me♪

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.740
I was using you.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.742
(Tori)
You're the worst,
Vector!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:46.679
Take the most awful and
horrible person to ever live,

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.748
and you're worse than that.

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:49.482
That's sweet.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.118
But you don't have to shower me
with glowing compliments,

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.754
I am well aware
that I'm amazing.

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.756
No you're not.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.057
Don Thousand...

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.693
We've had a good journey
and some good times,

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:03.296
but this is where we part ways.

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.764
Do not be absurd.

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.333
You are nothing without me.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.202
Actually...

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:12.505
Now that I have the power
of the other Emperors,

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.475
I'm stronger
than you'll ever be!

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.280
No...
Stop this, Vector!

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:26.386
You need me!

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.221
No!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.760
(laughing)

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.729
Don Thousand...

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.730
He is no more...

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.033
I have plans for you too, Nash.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.602
You're getting blasted
with 300 points of damage

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:44.470
for every monster that
was destroyed...

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.175
Doesn't take a genius to tell
you that 900 is more than 100.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:53.313
You're goin' on a one-way
trip to Doomsville.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.748
So long, Nash!

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.318
Look out!

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.753
It's gonna take
more than that, Vector.

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:04.757
Dream Shark's special ability
lets it swim back to my field

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:07.760
from the graveyard.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.596
That changes nothing.

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:13.766
Actually, it
blocks your damage!

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.301
You knew I was setting you up.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:20.240
Did you seriously think I was
suddenly willing to trust you♪

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.742
To feel sorry for you♪

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.643
Shark...

00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:28.181
You mighta fooled everyone
else, but you didn't fool me.

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.084
You're a pretty
smart guy, Nash...

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.119
I'd probably like you
if I wasn't busy

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:37.657
wanting to rip your
game apart and destroy you!

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:40.460
I draw!

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.994
Heh!

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:44.631
I activate Admiration
of the Thousands!

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:47.033
With this Rank Up Magic card,

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.369
I can summon multiple
Chaos Numbers

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.171
with the same Rank
from the graveyard...

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:56.442
And they will rise
stronger than before!

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.710
Silent honor!

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.378
Masquerade!

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.347
Archfiend Seraph
and Ragnafinity

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.650
All resurrect at higher levels!

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.354
And I can unite 'em all to
summon your worst nightmare.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:15.161
With these four monsters, I
build the Overlay Network.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.764
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:21.734
I summon Chaos Number 5!

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.704
Chaos Chimera Dragon!

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:36.516
Say goodbye to what little
hope you had, Nash.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:47.593
Chaos Chimera Dragon
means you can say goodbye

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:50.129
to what little hope
you had left.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.703
First I should mention
that Chaos Chimera Dragon

00:13:56.703 --> 00:14:02.208
gains 1,000 attack points for
every Chaos Overlay Unit it has.

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:07.480
And now, in exchange for one of
those Chaos Overlay Units,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.016
Chimera Dragon can
attack you by banishing

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.251
one random card in your deck.

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:15.555
Sure, it loses a thousand attack
points, but that leaves it

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:19.625
with more than enough power
to crush you once and for all.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.197
This has been loads
of fun, Nash,

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:29.135
but I'm afraid all good
things must come to an end.

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.503
Attack!

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.005
This isn't over yet, Vector!

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:36.242
Once per turn, Dream Shark can
lower its defense points

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:40.680
by a thousand and save it
itself from being destroyed.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.014
It makes no difference...

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:45.618
I'll just activate Chimera
Dragon's ability again.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:49.222
It uses another Chaos Overlay
Unit to banish a card

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.057
from your deck and attack you.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:55.027
Your Dream Shark will
be sunk very soon.

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.468
Nighty, night, Dream Shark...

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:04.337
Sweet Dreams!

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.740
You've got nothing to
stop my Dragon's attacks now.

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:12.745
And for a third time, I activate
Chaos Chimera's ability.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.282
There goes another card
from your deck.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.651
When Chimera Dragon
attacks directly,

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.254
its attack points
are cut in half...

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.623
but that's still plenty
to squash you

00:15:23.623 --> 00:15:27.026
like the puny
little insect that you are!

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:29.061
Guess this is it, then.

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.763
Yeah...
it is.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.332
Vector is the victor!

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:36.736
Chaos Chimera Dragon, attack!

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:41.707
Shark!

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:47.513
I activate my trap
Depth Gardna!

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.347
I take no damage

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:53.219
and I can summon this
card as a Level 5 monster.

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:56.756
Come to the surface,
Depth Gardna!

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:01.060
Oh, brother...

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.362
Depth Gardna's attack
points become the same

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:06.766
as the amount of damage
I would've taken.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:07.500
Nash....

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.668
Why won't you
just lose already♪

00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:12.104
Well let's see if you're still
up for kicking and screaming

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:15.675
after I activate Chimera
Dragon's special ability

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:19.745
and return all your banished
cards to the top of your deck.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.617
This'll stop you from
drawing a new card.

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:28.287
And it's not like those
three cards were useful.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.224
(Nash) Actually, they are.

00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:34.227
I draw!

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:36.229
Funny you say these
cards aren't useful,

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:40.099
'cause I'm about to use one
of 'em to finish you off.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:43.736
I'm afraid that won't
be possible, Nash.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:44.704
Why not♪

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:47.406
Because even though
you got your cards back,

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:50.343
Chimera Dragon's special
ability prevents you

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.678
from actually playing them.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:53.412
What♪

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.580
Whoa!
Not good.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.215
That is putting it lightly.

00:16:56.215 --> 00:17:00.753
Nash will not be able to play
the next two cards he draws.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.154
Here's the best part!

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.757
I can pay half my life
points during your turn

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:08.761
to give Chimera Dragon all its
Chaos Overlay Units back...

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.731
And unlike the cards
at the top of your deck,

00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:12.765
they aren't worthless,

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:17.737
which means the big guy is back
to packing 4000 attack points.

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:21.974
So then, this means that when it
becomes Vector's turn again...

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:26.312
He'll be able to
finish Shark off for good.

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.747
So sorry, Nash.

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:31.551
But this time,
there's no way out.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:38.391
Any last words, Nash♪

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.292
Actually, yes.

00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:43.095
I want to thank you
for tossing me a lifeline.

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:43.763
Huh♪

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:48.734
I activate Infinity Tooth
from my hand!

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.071
This spell allows me to
send a card from my deck

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:55.241
to my graveyard for
every Overlay Unit

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.677
that Chimera Dragon has.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.747
You got rid of
the useless cards.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:02.582
That's right.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.751
And now I get to draw
one new card!

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.154
Chaos Draw!

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:11.490
I summon Depth Biter!

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.968
Now I overlay Depth Gardna
and Depth Biter.

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:31.744
I Xyz Summon Number 73:
Abyss Splash!

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:38.751
Next, I activate Abyss
Splash's special ability!

00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:40.353
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:43.756
it doubles its attack
points when it battles.

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:49.195
Go, Abyss Splash!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:52.365
Attack Chaos Chimera Dragon!

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:56.202
That pathetic little
minnow can't hurt me...

00:18:56.202 --> 00:19:00.306
Not with my trap Overlay
Burglary in place!

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.743
When your Xyz Monster
attacks my Xyz Monster,

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.247
this trap steals one of your
monster's Overlay Units!

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:10.650
And you know what that means...

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:16.222
Chaos Chimera Dragon gains a
thousand attack points!

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.760
You managed to
defeat me twice before.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.762
But third time's the charm.

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:25.765
You don't stand a chance now,
and really, you never...

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:28.501
You're the one who
doesn't stand a chance.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.468
I wasn't finished.

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:33.372
That's where you're wrong,
Vector, you are finished,

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.174
thanks to this!

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:35.741
No!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.510
Not that Rank Up Magic card!

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.347
Rank-Up Magic Quick Chaos
ranks up my Number

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.684
into a Chaos Number.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.253
Say goodbye to Abyss Splash

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:53.159
and say hello
to Chaos Number 73!

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:58.564
Rise from the depths,
Abyss Supra Splash!

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.510
Your evil ends here
and now, Vector.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.348
Abyss Supra,
attack Chaos Chimera!

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.016
Ha!

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.085
That lug can't
defeat my Dragon!

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:23.289
It can, once I activate
its special ability...

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:25.391
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:29.762
Abyss Supra Splash gains all
your monster's attack points.

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:33.099
That's right, Vector,
all of them!

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:33.466
No...

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:37.570
Chaos Chimera Dragon
has 5,000 attack points...

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.741
And now Abyss Supra will
gain all that power.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.345
8,000 attack points....

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:49.381
This attack is for every
Emperor you betrayed...

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:54.086
For all the pain and
suffering you caused...

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.588
And for me.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.290
You can't do this, Nash!

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.426
Goodbye, Vector.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.479
(Vector) How...

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.648
How could I lose♪

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.053
(gasping)

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:29.736
