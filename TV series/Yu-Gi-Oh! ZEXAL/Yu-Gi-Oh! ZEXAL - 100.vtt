WEBVTT

00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:03.908
(Yuma)
Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:05.676
(Vector)
There are seven
Mytherian Numbers

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:08.345
that are scattered across
the human world.

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:11.115
When we acquire them,
we can wield their power

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.651
and use them to crush Astral.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.453
(Astral)
These are the ancient
ruins we seek, Yuma.

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.590
One of the seven Numbers we're
looking for must be inside.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.562
(Nash)
Yuma and Astral must be looking
for the Mythyrian Numbers too.

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:29.767
(both)
That's not good.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.403
(Rio)
Reginald.

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:34.104
You came across Nash
in the forest?

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:37.741
Yeah, he told us that he's
just visiting here on vacation.

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.611
Shark and Astral are
convinced it isn't true.

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:43.180
They think he's a Barian.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.214
Is that a card?

00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:47.885
That could be the Number
we're looking for.

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:52.456
I am Mach, the guardian charged
with protecting the Number.

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:56.026
It will never be yours, unless
you can vanquish me in a duel

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:59.096
and prove that you are truly
worthy of possessing it.

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.266
If you do not pass your test,
the Number will remain here

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:07.705
along with two of your
companions' souls.

(Yuma)
Go, Gagaga!

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.745
Attack that facedown card.

00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:34.858
A way out.

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:37.194
It is just as the legends say.

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:39.496
The wise duelist
understands that the bond

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:43.934
between friends can open
up new paths.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:45.836
They're safe.
For the moment.

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:49.440
However, I now Activate
Secret Sect Druid Wid's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.174
special ability.

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:52.810
When destroyed, this monster
allows me to utilize

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.179
the spell Labyrinth
of Decisions.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.982
But first, I send two cards
from my hand to the graveyard,

00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:03.720
in order to activate the trap
card, Unfair Treaty.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.990
(Astral)
Mach is up to something.

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:11.095
Here we go again.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.297
(Nash)
If I could repair
my Baria Crystal,

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.766
I could use my power
to get out of here.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.934
But it's impossible.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.770
Hang on, Shark,
I'll save you guys.

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:20.838
All right, little fella.

00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:24.475
Time to blow away some
of Mach's life points.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.444
Gusting Gail!

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:33.183
With each move, you further seal

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:34.918
the fate of you
and your friends.

00:03:34.918 --> 00:03:39.223
Labyrinth of Decisions
takes effect now.

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:44.228
This spell requires me to
surrender 600 life points,

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:48.465
but I can then send a card in
your hand to the graveyard.

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:49.633
I'm losing a card?

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.635
You will lose far more
than that, Yuma.

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:53.704
I activate Unfair Treaty.

00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:54.638
With my card combo complete,

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:57.774
my life points are safe but
yours, I'm afraid, are not.

00:03:57.774 --> 00:04:00.744
You must give up 600 life points
in addition to discarding

00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:03.347
one card in your hand
to the graveyard.

00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:06.750
Seriously?
His strategy
is remarkable.

00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:10.120
You must discard
a card from your hand.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.524
I know, here, happy?

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:19.396
(Astral)
I understand now.

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:22.166
Our actions in this
duel will determine

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:25.669
the fate of Shark and Nash.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.071
This Number Guardian
is presenting you

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.107
with an agonizing dilemma.

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:31.074
Whenever we attack him,

00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:34.945
a new escape route will
open for Shark and Nash.

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:35.712
It will?

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:37.147
(Astral)
However, we will
lose life points

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:40.117
when we attack due to
Mach's card combination.

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:41.618
If we attack,
we will be weakened,

00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:45.222
but if we do not
we cannot save them.
(Mach)
Exactly.

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:48.140
Will you save your life
points or your friends?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.896
Will you save your life
points or your friends?

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.765
Hey, is this supposed
to be a duel

00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:58.001
or some kind of
multiple choice test?

00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.037
I overlay my
two Level 4 monsters

00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:03.106
in order to build
the Overlay Network.

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:08.312
I Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:18.755
With that, I'll end my turn.

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.925
Your Number looks
quite impressive.

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:24.761
However...

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:26.530
Looks can be deceiving.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.901
I summon Secret Sect Druid Dru.

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.104
And Druid Dru also
lets me summon

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:36.240
another Druid from my graveyard.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.577
Return here, Wid The Secret
Maneuvering Druid.

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:44.381
And now, the Number
I guard shall be revealed.

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:46.416
I overlay my two Level 4 Druids

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:49.019
in order to build
the Overlay Network.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:55.125
I Xyz Summon Number 44:
Sky Pegasus!

00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:02.266
Now arise my mighty steed.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:07.070
Awake from your age-old sleep
and soar down to this world!

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.543
Display your full splendor and
might to these lowly creatures.

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:16.246
That is the Number we seek.

00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:20.651
You will seek for it in vain
unless you pass this test.

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:24.321
I activate Sky Pegasus'
special ability.

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.523
Avail yourself of
one Overlay Unit

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:29.092
to unleash your mighty power.

00:06:29.092 --> 00:06:32.929
Now rid the field of
Yuma's pathetic Number.

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:33.497
What?

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:36.199
Your Number is now doomed
unless you shield it

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.169
by sacrificing 500
of your life points.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.305
Some choice you're givin' me.

00:06:41.305 --> 00:06:43.173
Yuma, without Utopia,

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:46.877
it will be difficult
to save Shark.

00:06:46.877 --> 00:06:47.911
Yeah, I know.

00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:50.013
I can't afford to
lose Utopia right now,

00:06:50.013 --> 00:06:52.916
so I choose to give up
my life points instead.

00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:55.485
Bad choice because Sky Pegasus'

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.422
additional special
ability activates.

00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:00.057
Whenever you give
up life points,

00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:04.294
you also take an
equal amount of damage.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.599
Oh, no, Yuma, Astral!

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.537
I can't afford to keep losing
my life points this way.

00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:15.138
Whoever designed
this place must've

00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:18.508
had a serious maze craze.

00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:23.447
What's going on?

00:07:23.447 --> 00:07:24.915
Reginald, hang on.

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:26.983
Yuma is trying to rescue you.

00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:28.018
<i>Oh yeah, how?</i>

00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:31.321
By beating the knight who
trapped you, that's how.

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:33.323
You mean the guy in
the goofy armor?

00:07:33.323 --> 00:07:34.257
What happens if Yuma fails?

00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:36.293
<i>(Astral)</i>
Then you will
never leave here.

00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:39.696
<i>The traps along your path are</i>
connected to Yuma's duel.

00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:42.699
<i>Whenever we attack, a door</i>
on your side will open.

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:45.202
<i>But when we do attack,</i>
we lose life points.

00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:48.672
<i>It is a most precarious</i>
situation.

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:50.140
Even when they are separated,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.144
true friends will find
a way to help each other.

00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.047
Help each other...

00:07:58.915 --> 00:07:59.516
Of course.

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:01.485
<i>Shark, is there anything</i>
at your current location

00:08:01.485 --> 00:08:04.888
<i>that might give us a clue</i>
how to win this duel?

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:06.223
I'm not sure.

00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:08.959
Let me look around.

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.629
<i>(Astral)</i>
Well, do you
see anything?

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:13.864
Yes... maybe.

00:08:13.864 --> 00:08:16.633
There's a kind of mural
with ancient writing on it.

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:18.969
<i>That must be it.</i>

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:20.070
The test that we must pass

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.407
actually takes the form
of a complex puzzle.

00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:26.977
I believe we were separated from
Shark and Nash for a reason.

00:08:26.977 --> 00:08:30.180
The traps steered them to
a location containing clues

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.016
that can help us win this duel.

00:08:33.016 --> 00:08:33.884
All right, Reginald,

00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:36.253
read the mural and tell
us what it says.

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:38.488
I don't understand a word of it.

00:08:38.488 --> 00:08:41.758
This mural tells the story
of a legendary hero

00:08:41.758 --> 00:08:42.959
from an ancient past.

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.629
You mean, you can
actually read that?

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:46.963
It's all about a valiant knight.

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:51.234
Long ago, this knight bravely
defended his kingdom.

00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:52.903
Riding an incredible
horse named Pegasus,

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:56.339
he and his fellow knights
defeated all the evil forces

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:57.874
that threatened the land.

00:08:57.874 --> 00:09:00.444
In time, the whole
kingdom was at peace.

00:09:00.444 --> 00:09:04.014
Then, one day, the knight
left the castle.

00:09:04.014 --> 00:09:05.282
Longing to see his family,

00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:09.186
he and Pegasus journeyed
to his home village.

00:09:09.186 --> 00:09:09.886
But while he was gone,

00:09:09.886 --> 00:09:13.690
some of his fellow knights
grew envious of their king.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.458
They began to grumble

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:17.394
and say that they should
rule the land instead.

00:09:17.394 --> 00:09:19.696
Soon, whispers of
rebellion and betrayal

00:09:19.696 --> 00:09:22.966
could be heard echoing
through the castle.

00:09:22.966 --> 00:09:25.469
The whole kingdom
was now in peril.

00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:29.372
That's some fairy tale.

00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:30.474
I do not understand.

00:09:30.474 --> 00:09:33.910
What is the legend
supposed to tell us?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.982
It stops there so I don't
know how the story ended.

00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:46.189
Yuma, attack quick
or they'll get crushed.

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:48.959
I'm on it.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.729
I draw!

00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:54.998
Yuma, you must attack now!

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:56.299
We will lose more life points,

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:58.435
but until we come up with
a better strategy,

00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:01.538
it is the only way
to save Shark and Nash.

00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:02.672
(Yuma)
Right.

00:10:02.672 --> 00:10:04.474
Get ready Utopia.

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:06.443
Take aim at Sky Pegasus.

00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:10.313
In that case, I activate
my trap Intrigue Shield.

00:10:10.313 --> 00:10:12.215
By equipping Pegasus
with this shield,

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:15.452
my noble steed is impervious
to any battle damage

00:10:15.452 --> 00:10:20.090
and cannot be destroyed,
so my Number survives!

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.060
While you will grow even weaker.

00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:29.966
<i>Your attack activated</i>
my card combination.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:34.371
You will not only be robbed
of 600 life points,

00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:38.408
but you must send yet
another card to the graveyard.

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:40.577
Fine.

00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:50.453
Sky Pegasus, activate
your special ability.

00:10:50.453 --> 00:10:52.989
Yuma just lost 600 life points.

00:10:52.989 --> 00:10:57.327
Now deal him the same
amount of damage.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.866
Yuma, no!

00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:06.269
I'm done.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:10.073
I'll put one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:11.274
Shark, does the mural resume

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:13.743
in the chamber where
you are now?

00:11:13.743 --> 00:11:14.477
It does.

00:11:14.477 --> 00:11:16.479
The story of the knight
and Pegasus continues.

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:19.049
When he learned of the
treachery of his companions,

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:21.718
the heroic knight rushed
back to the castle,

00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:23.019
hoping to restore order.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:24.854
He begged the other knights
to remember the oath

00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:28.258
they had taken to uphold peace
and justice in the kingdom,

00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:32.395
but they were too blinded
by their thirst for power.

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:34.230
The rebellious knights
turned their swords

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.633
against their former
friend and attacked him.

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:39.402
The heroic knight
remained loyal,

00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:42.038
refusing to battle those
who had been his friends.

00:11:42.038 --> 00:11:43.940
Without mercy,
the rebels continued

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.110
to attack him until he fell.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.578
At that moment, all seemed lost

00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:51.214
for the kingdom's
last true knight.

00:11:51.214 --> 00:11:53.850
But the winged horse
Pegasus suddenly flew down

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.586
and landed between the rebels
and his master.

00:11:56.586 --> 00:11:58.755
The horse was determined
to protect the knight,

00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:01.758
no matter the consequences.

00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:04.594
And? What
happened next?

00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:07.564
<i>Sorry, Yuma, I can't tell you.</i>

00:12:07.564 --> 00:12:11.901
Unfortunately, the rest of
the mural has crumbled away.

00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:14.537
What, are you kidding?

00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:17.741
(Nash)
This legend seems
so familiar to me.

00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:19.442
But how could that be?

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:21.945
I have the strangest feeling.

00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:24.347
As if I've been here before.

00:12:24.347 --> 00:12:26.916
But that's impossible.

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:29.185
My turn, I draw!

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:32.522
And now, Sky Pegasus
uses one Overlay Unit

00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:36.126
to eliminate your monster.

00:12:36.893 --> 00:12:39.262
The only way to prevent
Utopia's destruction

00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:41.965
is by giving up another
500 life points.

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:44.887
Either way will
lead to your defeat.

00:12:46.803 --> 00:12:50.340
There's no way you can win if
you keep losing life points.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.007
Forget about us.

00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:52.008
With your lame dueling skills,

00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:54.811
you need all the life
points you can get.

00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:55.712
Make your decision.

00:12:55.712 --> 00:12:58.748
You can save yourself
or save your friends.

00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:01.418
Which will it be?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.487
You must help us.

00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:07.490
Sacrifice your life points.

00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:10.493
That's the most cowardly
thing I ever heard.

00:13:10.493 --> 00:13:11.294
Think what you want,

00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:15.532
but I just remembered
the rest of the legend.

00:13:18.334 --> 00:13:20.704
With the rebels focused
on attacking Pegasus,

00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:23.473
the noble knight
could have run away.

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:26.509
But, instead, he remained
beside his faithful horse

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:31.247
and faced their adversaries
together and forever.

00:13:35.685 --> 00:13:36.519
Don't you get it?

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:38.755
This legend is about
trusting in your friends

00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:39.889
and always sticking with them

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.558
to the bitter end,
no matter what.

00:13:41.558 --> 00:13:45.295
Please, Yuma trust me
and protect your Utopia.

00:13:45.295 --> 00:13:46.963
Why should he trust you?

00:13:46.963 --> 00:13:49.999
You could be a Barian.

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:58.775
Oh, Reginald.

00:14:00.944 --> 00:14:03.947
You were right,
Shark, it's true.

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:06.516
I can feel my power returning.

00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:10.353
So now all can be revealed.

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:16.359
As you can see,
I am indeed a Barian.

00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:16.860
Dumon.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.495
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:21.765
Yuma, I told you that
he was really a Barian.

00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:23.299
This guy is actually Dumon.

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:26.236
Even so, he could be telling
the truth about the legend.

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:29.539
<i>(Shark)</i>
Don't make the same mistake
you did with Ray.

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:31.174
(Astral)
Well Yuma?

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:34.711
I don't... I don't know.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:39.149
I will not interfere
in this choice, Yuma.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:42.152
It is yours alone.

00:14:42.452 --> 00:14:45.755
I have waited long enough,
you must choose now.

00:14:45.789 --> 00:14:50.226
Sky Pegasus, strike down Utopia.

00:14:51.027 --> 00:14:52.662
I've decided to protect Utopia

00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:56.366
by giving up my life points.

00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:58.301
No way!

00:14:58.301 --> 00:15:01.104
As you know, that decision
will cost you dearly

00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:04.140
as Sky Pegasus uses
its special ability

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.711
to deal you another
500 points of damage.

00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:16.186
The guardian's test has
left us severely weakened.

00:15:17.854 --> 00:15:19.556
But in our case,

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:22.792
that could be useful.

00:15:23.626 --> 00:15:24.194
Yuma!

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:27.230
I warned you not
to listen to him!

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.398
I know, Shark.

00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:30.600
You may be right,
but I gotta trust

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.970
<i>my gut and I need</i>
you to trust me!

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.406
Yuma...

00:15:36.406 --> 00:15:39.242
I'm still playing to win, Mach.

00:15:39.242 --> 00:15:44.747
Yuma, our weakness is now
our strength, attack him now!

00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:48.551
Utopia, take down Sky Pegasus!

00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.421
Rising Sun Slash!

00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:56.893
I'll deflect your attack
with my trap Intrigue Shield.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.565
Now once more, due to
my Labyrinth spell,

00:16:02.565 --> 00:16:04.467
you must send
a card to the graveyard.

00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:09.372
I know, and you're gonna
combo it with Unfair Treaty.

00:16:09.372 --> 00:16:12.075
It will reduce Yuma's
life points to nothing

00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:14.844
and that will be it.

00:16:16.746 --> 00:16:18.381
The trap didn't work.

00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:20.917
Mach's card combination
is useless right now.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:23.720
Ordinarily, he would have
to pay 600 life points

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.623
to activate his spell
Labyrinth of Decisions.

00:16:26.623 --> 00:16:29.626
But since Mach also used
his trap Unfair Treaty,

00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:31.995
we had to pay those
life points instead.

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:34.230
Because of your choice
to protect Utopia,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.765
you were severely weakened.

00:16:35.765 --> 00:16:38.034
In fact, your life points
were lowered so much

00:16:38.034 --> 00:16:42.138
that Mach's card combination
was effectively neutralized.

00:16:42.138 --> 00:16:43.640
That is why you survived.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.277
<i>Our weakness has suddenly</i>
become an advantage.

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:50.699
Now Mach is the one who must
pay all those life points.

00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:05.962
We have the upper
hand over Mach now.

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:06.996
We can win this.

00:17:06.996 --> 00:17:08.431
I agree, which is exactly why

00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:11.768
I'm activating the card
I just sent to the graveyard,

00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:15.271
the trap called Hyper Quick!

00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:17.373
I get to draw one
card from my deck.

00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:19.108
If the card turns out
to be a spell

00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:20.843
then I can use it right away.

00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:23.313
Everything depends on this draw.

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:24.514
No problem, Astral.

00:17:24.514 --> 00:17:27.884
I'm feelin' the flow!

00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:30.753
All right, perfect!

00:17:30.753 --> 00:17:34.057
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Numeron Force.

00:17:34.057 --> 00:17:38.895
This card ranks up Utopia
into a Chaos Xyz Monster.

00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:43.333
I rebuild the Overlay
Network with Utopia.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:47.470
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.980
Appear, Chaos Number 39:
Utopia Ray Victory.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.368
I activate Utopia Ray
Victory's special ability.

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:19.535
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:18:19.535 --> 00:18:23.639
Utopia Ray Victory gains your
monster's attack points.

00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:26.843
Victory Charge!

00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:37.487
Now that you're powered to
the max, attack Sky Pegasus!

00:18:37.487 --> 00:18:41.791
Rising Sun Double Victory Slash!

00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:02.311
It's over.

00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:11.821
You have passed the test.

00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:14.891
Tell me, do you know how
the legend of Pegasus

00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:17.260
and the knight finally ended?

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.897
Of course, after all,
I am Pegasus.

00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:22.331
In the end, the rebels were

00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:25.201
moved by the sacrifice
my master and I made.

00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:30.206
They were filled with shame and
gave up their traitorous ways.

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:33.910
My master and I then took
leave of this earthly realm.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.314
We were never seen again,
or so the legend claimed.

00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:41.250
Ever since then,
I have had no other master.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.352
But because of your belief
in your friends,

00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:47.790
I place myself in your service.

00:19:58.634 --> 00:20:01.003
Number 44.

00:20:01.003 --> 00:20:01.938
You're a Barian.

00:20:01.938 --> 00:20:03.773
So why did you help us?

00:20:03.806 --> 00:20:05.041
I am not sure.

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.742
There was something
about that legend

00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:09.112
that moved me deeply
and inspired me

00:20:09.112 --> 00:20:10.379
to come to Yuma's aid.

00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:12.415
<i>(Yuma)</i>
Dumon, thanks a lot.

00:20:12.415 --> 00:20:13.516
<i>If it wasn't for your help,</i>

00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:16.586
<i>I know I would've</i>
totally lost the duel.

00:20:16.586 --> 00:20:18.688
No, my actions mattered little.

00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:20.756
If I had not told you
about the legend,

00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:22.658
you still would
have put your friends

00:20:22.658 --> 00:20:24.327
above you own interests.

00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:26.762
I am certain that we
will all meet again.

00:20:26.796 --> 00:20:29.065
Do not expect my help at
our next encounter,

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:34.237
however, because we will
face each other as enemies.

00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:46.048
(Yuma)
Astral, look.

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:48.718
It's a King's Coin.

00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:50.353
What's a King's Coin?

00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:52.121
Whenever my dad went
on an adventure

00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:53.356
and explored a new place,

00:20:53.356 --> 00:20:55.558
he'd always leave one
of these coins behind.

00:20:55.558 --> 00:20:58.494
Meaning your father must
have visited these ruins.

00:20:58.494 --> 00:21:00.596
That's right, he was here.

00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:05.801
And I can sense he's somewhere
out there watching over me.

00:21:06.402 --> 00:21:08.371
I've been thinking a lot
about our mission.

00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:11.040
My dad always tried to
trust and befriend people

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.409
and the Barians know
I'm the same way.

00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:15.278
They'll try to
use that against me.

00:21:15.278 --> 00:21:18.214
But I wanna keep following
in Dad's footsteps

00:21:18.214 --> 00:21:19.315
no matter what it takes.

00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:22.051
So I'm gonna keep
trusting in others.

00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:23.986
(Astral)
It is clear that
Yuma has decided

00:21:23.986 --> 00:21:25.655
on the path he must travel.

00:21:25.655 --> 00:21:28.291
I am still not sure I can
trust Yuma, however.

00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:32.628
Someday soon, I may have
to take a different path.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.947
