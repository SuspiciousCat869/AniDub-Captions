BEAST warrior PUMA:
Sparrow!

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.630
SPARROW: I have
journeyed through time

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.130
and space to fight the forces

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.990
of evil, and restore
justice to the galaxy!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.660
I am the Sparrow!

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.090
Galaxy QUEEN:
How?

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.190
Furious Max sealed you away
in a dimensional prison!

[Snoring]
-I escaped!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.090
Well, things have changed
since you were sealed away!

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.560
Furious Max NOW rules over
the entire galaxy!

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.060
His reign is about to
come to an end!

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.260
Go mega-Punch surprise!

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.530
it Can't be... the galaxy
queen's True identity

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.360
is none other than...

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.190
you fool. Nobody can stop
the dark emperor's curse!

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.730
Now you're my
puppet.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.960
Just like your
precious Puma.

Knock it off!

You need to wake up.

No I don't.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.530
Did you know that there's a boy
called the Sparrow,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.590
and that he's from a different
world, just like me?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.330
Yeah, he's from the planet
vortexia or something.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.730
Where is that?

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.790
Leave me alone, I'm
trying to sleep.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.260
Yuma, please. I
need to know more.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.330
Fine, I'll
turn it on.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.690
Wooohoo!

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.290
I thought that class
would never end!

Crunchy ice-Cream taco,
here I come!

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.060
We need to return to your
house immediately.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.460
Why is that?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160
I have to "tune in to watch
the Sparrow's destiny

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.790
continue to unfold."

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.390
Huh?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.360
If the Sparrow really arrived
here through a dimensional

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.730
vortex, then there's a chance
that he might know something

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.090
about me and my
missing memories.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.030
You don't understand what
tv is, do you?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.960
In the real world, there
isn't any Sparrow!

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.830
TORI: Hey yuma,
did you hear?

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.190
Hear what?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.960
The Sparrow is
down by the seaport!

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.690
He is where?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.490
They built a set or a studio or
something, down on south street!

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.730
BRONK: Let's jam down
there and take a look!

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.130
That Sparrow could Save
my day any day!

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.360
He is so super
and dreamy!

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.890
We cannot squander this
opportunity, yuma.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.360
I think I'm just gonna go work
on some dueling techniques...

I saw this on a reality show
about celebrity fan clubs.

it is nice to meet you,
my name is Nelson.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.160
What is a "Nelson?"

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.930
that wasn't too
hard, right?

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.390
Hey, what do you say
we get to know each

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.190
other more with a duel?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.690
Sparrow's mom:
There you are!

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.660
Who's this boy,
Nelson?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.730
Mom! Uhhh...

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.260
that's your mom?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.390
You're not to speak to anyone
except for authorized personnel!

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.590
It's her... the galaxy queen.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.560
I know that mom,
but uh...

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.890
but nothing!

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.860
If people found out what kind of
a kid you really are, the

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.330
illusion of the Sparrow
would be shattered!

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.830
and it's not just about you.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.790
Think about how many people
depend on you being the Sparrow.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.590
You're part of something much
bigger than yourself, Nelson.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.030
You need to remember that.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.530
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.930
Huh? Well We, uh...

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.590
if you tell anyone
that you met Nelson,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.390
I will make sure you never duel
in this town again!

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.090
Come on lady, let go of me!

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.260
Shoo! On your way.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.860
I'm not gonna say anything!

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.190
Not cool.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.430
I'm sorry, yuma!

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.790
Nelson! We're gonna
have that duel someday!

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.230
But first,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.660
you have to stop letting
everyone tell you who to be.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.130
I can't.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.790
The Sparrow is more
important than I am.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.290
Nelson Andrews
doesn't matter.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.690
Nelson!

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.760
I never knew being a
tv star was so hard.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.490
I am not following this.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.430
Why was the Sparrow calling
himself a Nelson?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.630
There's no such thing
as the Sparrow.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.130
I told you he's made-up.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.430
Huh?

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.830
Somebody somewhere
just thought him up.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.430
That's how tv works astral,
it's all just pretend.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.290
You mean, that someone was
attempting to trick me?

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.090
No one was trying to trick you,
it's just entertainment.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.260
So then... he doesn't
know anything...

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.490
I've been saying that, but you
haven't been listening.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.990
I see now.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.660
Hold on?
What's wrong?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.360
What's with
the sad face?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.860
You kinda look like
you're feeling

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.530
bummed out all of a sudden.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.690
What is
"Feeling Bummed out?"

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.930
bummed out is when you
go to the Candy shop

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.530
and they're all out of your
favorite chocolate bar.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.360
I understand. So Nelson is
bummed out too.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.330
Huh?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.930
Did you not hear the
last thing he said?

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.830
"Nelson Andrews
doesn't matter."

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.060
What's that?

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.860
It's a card.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.760
Number: Yes, Nelson.
Let the number take hold.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.260
[groaning]

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.730
Man A: Oh, hey man.
Nice cape.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.960
Disregarding this city's
littering laws? I know you.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.590
You're one of the dark
emperor's minions, aren't you?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.190
Eh...
the what?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.360
C'mon!

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.590
Time for me to
take out the trash.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.290
Aaahh!

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.390
[Meowing]

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.130
Man B: Hey you,
get outta the road!

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.130
Only a follower of
the dark emperor

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.460
furious Max would try to
harm an innocent creature.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.930
It's too bad you don't
have nine lives!

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.260
[Whipping sounds]

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.960
[people screaming]

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.630
Female ANNOUNCER: Multiple
eyewitnesses report

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.260
that the assailant was none

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.090
other than the Sparrow, the hero
of the popular tv series.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.760
We go now to a press
conference being held

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.790
by the show's producers.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.990
Our Sparrow would
never do such things.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.360
He stands for honor,
truth, and justice.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.960
This is awful.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.130
Someone's trying to
make the Sparrow look bad.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.990
What are we doing
out here, Tori?

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.130
We're out here to prove
the Sparrow's innocence.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.160
Tying random people up
and flipping over cars?

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.990
The Sparrow would never
do stuff like that.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.460
Yeah, you're right
about that.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.430
He'd be
way too afraid.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.790
Way too what?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.560
Way too...
too awesome.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.260
Man D: Help!

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.330
That way!

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.660
Let's go!

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.030
Are you okay, sir?

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.960
Some Odd ball wearing a cape
came outta nowhere.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.590
Over there!

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.130
Hey you, stop!

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.860
Hold it right there!

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.460
It is you!

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.360
Yuma, just stay away from me.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.430
Where is he?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.290
I dunno...
he got away from us.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.530
That was definitely Nelson
behind that Mask.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.230
Why is he doing all this?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.060
It just doesn't seem like the
kid I met the other day.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.730
The answer is out there.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.590
Find it.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.330
And how do I do that?
I'm all ears.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.890
You made a promise to
Nelson when you met.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.760
You should fulfill
that promise.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.490
Huh?

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.260
You told Nelson that
you would duel him.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.460
That's exactly what
you should do.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.860
A duel can bring out
someone's inner strength,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.330
no matter how
deeply it is buried.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.360
"Nelson Andrews
doesn't matter."

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.560
Yeah, let's do this.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.490
Aaaaand... action!

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.990
Nelson, why are you going
around and attacking people?

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.730
What are you doing here?

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.830
I thought I told
you to stay away.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.760
What are you doing running
around dressing up

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.430
and acting up
like the Sparrow?

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.630
I have to fulfill my
duty to the galaxy queen.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.790
Your mom?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.630
I swore to defeat
the dark emperor

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.860
furious Max and
his minions.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.630
Nelson...

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.790
why do you keep
calling me by that name?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.190
For I am known in every corner
of the universe as the Sparrow!

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.830
Now, as for you,
why have you come here?

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.830
Has the dark emperor
managed to sink his claws

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.930
into you, as well?

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.660
"Think about how many
people depend

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.860
on you being the Sparrow."

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.790
Oh, man, you're really letting
all this get to you.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.990
What is going on?
All what?

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.490
Nelson has started thinking
that he's actually the Sparrow.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.890
What?

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.760
So you are saying, he's
stuck in the fantasy

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.860
tv world of make-Believe
and pretend?

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.690
Well Yeah, listen to him!

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:39.630
He must've snapped under
all the pressure or something.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.090
The world is waiting for me to
deliver justice far and wide!

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.360
Snap out of it, Nelson!

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.360
Yuma, I didn't want
it to come to this.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.890
Alas, if you're with
the dark Emperor,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.860
then I have no choice
but to battle you!

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.760
Alright.
Bring it on!

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.660
You want a battle?

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.630
I challenge
you to a duel!

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.860
I accept your challenge.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.830
Duel disk go!

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.160
Duel gazer,
let's roll!

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.060
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.530
Get set to get decked!

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.330
You want a piece of me?

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.090
Well, I'm gonna serve
you the whole pie!

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.080
TOGETHER:
Let's duel!

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.530
You're going to lose yuma!

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.890
Do you see?

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.360
He's got a number
card, right?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.290
It must be amplifying
the pressure that

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.590
he feels to be
the Sparrow.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.190
So once again, it's your fault
that trouble is popping up.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.060
Right, let's do this!

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.160
I draw!

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.630
I summon beast warrior Puma!

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.730
[Roaring]

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.460
I have seen him
in action.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.530
Not only is he
incredibly acrobatic,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.760
he is a rather
gifted swordsman.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.460
I end my turn by
playing one card facedown.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.890
Puma, meet yuma!

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.490
I draw!

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.260
I summon gogogo golem!

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.860
I suppose you're going
to send that

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.760
lumbering brute
in to attack Puma.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.390
You took the words
right outta my mouth!

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.960
Gogogo gust!

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.360
I can't believe it!

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.030
You walked right into my trap!

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.960
Since I have three copies of
triple star trion in my hand,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.760
I can activate trion Barrier,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.790
and force your golem into
defense mode!

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.690
And then, I can summon my three
triple star trions to the field.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.490
Three cards at once?

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.360
I play one card facedown!

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.330
That's it!

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.660
then it's my turn!

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.530
I draw!

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.060
First, I'm releasing
two of my trions,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.630
so that I can
tribute summon!

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.360
Esper Star Sparrow is
ready to crash this party!

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.260
Astral, what's
tribute summoning?

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.390
To summon high-Level
powerful monsters,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.890
you must tribute
other monsters.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.160
Nelson had to
tribute 2 monsters

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.390
in order to summon his
epser star Sparrow.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.360
And now, I'll activate my
trion's special ability!

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.030
Which means, I can restack my
field by bringing back

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.560
the other two trions that
are in my graveyard.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.860
Go lavish return!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.590
Welcome back you two!

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.030
Next, I'm activating space
ration from my hand!

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.460
I can activate this
card's power because

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.060
esper star Sparrow
is on my field.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.160
Thanks to its effect, I can
draw two cards from my deck!

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.090
And with that done, I overlay
my three level 1 trions!

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.730
With These three monsters, I
build the overlay network!

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.830
I xyz summon!

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.930
Kneel Before number 83,
galaxy queen!

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.930
You just summoned
your mom.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.730
The galaxy queen...

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.130
huh?

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.530
She was revered as a good and
noble Leader, but then...

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.660
I equip the galaxy queen
with furious Max's curse!

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.960
While under this
spell's influence,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.230
the galaxy queen can't be
destroyed in any situation!

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.060
And now I use one overlay
unit to activate the

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.830
galaxy queen's
special ability!

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.190
The galaxy queen can grant every
monster on my field immortality

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.130
until my next turn, and allow
them to deal damage even if your

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.430
monster is in defense mode!

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.990
Galaxy QUEEN: Come!

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.390
Follow me and gain
the ultimate power!

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.930
So This is all kinds bad
news for me, isn't it?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.430
Correct.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.260
If gogogo golem is attacked,
I am afraid

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.230
it will not be very pleasant.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.190
Your life points will
be damaged.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.360
Beast warrior Puma,
attack!

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.630
Go Dark slash!

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.030
Since Gogogo golem is
in defense mode,

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.530
it can avoid being destroyed
in a battle once a turn!

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.330
Perhaps So, but your
life points still take damage!

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.930
And now, to finish
what Puma started,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:17.260
go star Sparrow, attack!

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.490
Hope You enjoy his
mega-Punch surprise!

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.060
[Screaming]

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.860
don't you see?

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.160
You can't win!

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.230
I am the Sparrow!

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.260
I have journeyed through
time and space to fight

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.360
the forces of evil and
restore justice to the galaxy!

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.890
Well you know what? I've
journeyed from my bedroom

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.160
to restore you to
your True self.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.010
And I'm not about
to back down!
