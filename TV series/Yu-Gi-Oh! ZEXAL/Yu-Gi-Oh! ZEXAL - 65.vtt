Dr. Faker!

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:08.004
Kite has been defeated
by Vetrix.

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:11.138
Doctor, we must stop
the tournament right now.

00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.371
Don't get so excited.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:15.271
The plan
is still in place.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:18.204
And it is safe as long as we
have the Sphere Field.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:25.771
Prepare for
the finals, Mr. Heartland.

Kite lost.

00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:42.738
Vetrix stole his
Number Cards and his soul.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.838
All Kite wanted to do
was save Hart.

00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:53.538
He just wanted to
protect what's precious to him.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.238
(Astral)
Yuma.

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.938
I believe Vetrix
used the power of his crest

00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:00.938
to take the souls of Dextra
and Hart as well.

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:03.504
Perhaps if we can
defeat him in the final duel,

00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:05.904
we can destroy that
power...

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:08.171
Yeah, you're right!

00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:09.504
We're gonna
beat that stinkin'--

you good luck.

Thanks guys,
I'll do my best.

This final,
championship battle

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:19.795
will take place in the
revolutionary

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:21.961
new Sphere Field!

this Sphere Field

will be an experience
that is out of this world.

00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:34.128
Whenever you use Numbers,

00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.195
the Sphere Field will
absorb the power they generate.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.495
What is this thing?

00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:19.728
Very interesting.

00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:22.661
This place is so freaky.

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.095
Well, that's Faker
for you.

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:28.561
Now the Sphere Field will raise
our two finalists

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.961
to the skies!

00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:33.461
What's that thing
made of?

00:05:33.495 --> 00:05:34.595
I don't know.

00:05:34.628 --> 00:05:37.628
It must be generated by
some kind of mysterious energy.

00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:43.361
I'm not surprised you made it
this far, Yuma.

00:05:43.395 --> 00:05:45.961
Yeah, why's that?

00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:47.861
Because of
the example set for you

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:50.528
by your dear deluded
father.

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:52.695
When I was
lost between dimensions,

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.661
I sometimes gave
up hope,

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:56.261
and I
would think of Kazuma,

00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:59.095
his belief in friendship
and never giving up.

00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:01.795
You have
that same spirit, Yuma...

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.695
The spirit that had
inspired me

00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:06.495
when I was
at my most desperate point.

00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:08.828
By then, Faker had
betrayed me,

00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:11.195
so I knew
your father was wrong.

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:13.595
Friendship isn't
precious.

00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:16.228
No, not by a long shot.

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:18.795
In fact,
it's pointless.

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:23.528
But your father was right
about never giving up.

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:26.895
And now that revenge
is my only reason for living,

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:31.095
I promise you I'll never give
up until I get it.

00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:32.328
You're wrong about revenge

00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.828
and you're wrong about
friendship.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.595
Trey's my friend

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.228
and I promised
to battle to save his family.

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:44.228
So I'm not just here to
save them Vetrix.

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:46.461
I'm here to save you.

00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:48.528
You're going to save me...

00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:49.695
from what?

00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:51.295
From revenge, Vetrix.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:55.695
It's like a poison that'll
only wind up destroying you!

00:06:55.728 --> 00:06:58.428
Trey, Quinton, and Quattro.

00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.695
You used them to get
your revenge.

00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:01.761
Oh, please.

00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:04.628
Those boys are just as much
trouble as friends are.

00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:06.628
Now all three
of those empty shells

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:08.495
are getting just what they
deserve.

00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:12.561
What they deserve?

00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:14.028
Exactly.

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.261
I gave each one of those
three losers a crest.

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:17.795
Those crests
were directly connected

00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:20.695
to their souls and gave
them great power.

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:22.628
And even with that power,

00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:24.661
all three
of them lost their battles

00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.528
and their souls just as
I knew they would.

00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:30.961
You knew that was going to
happen, but you still--

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:36.295
I did not realize humans could
be this heartless.

00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:38.861
You don't deserve to be
called a father!

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:39.961
How could you?

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:43.528
How could you let your sons
give up their souls?

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:47.461
I guess I'm just
a bad dad.

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.328
But can you really
judge me so harshly, Yuma?

00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:52.695
Don't you think your father
wants you to get revenge

00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:55.161
on Dr. Faker, too?

00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:56.461
No, I don't!

00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:59.361
And my father would never want
me to battle to get it!

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:00.961
Think again.

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:04.128
You don't know Kazuma as well
as I do, Yuma.

00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:06.361
See, he's been using you
all along

00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:07.828
to get his revenge.

00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.428
Isn't that right, Astral?

00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:12.361
What are you implying?

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:15.928
As both of you know, Numbers
have incredible power...

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:18.595
enough power,
in fact, to destroy this world.

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:24.361
Your father knew that if he
could give you the Numbers,

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:26.161
you would use their power
in battle

00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:28.195
and get his vengeance.

00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:32.761
And he did it by sending
your little friend, Astral.

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:34.828
You mean
that Dad sent Astral

00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:36.761
to help me destroy
the world?

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:38.095
Yes, he did,

00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:40.728
but luckily you won't have to
do it all by yourselves.

00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:41.961
Right, Faker?

00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:52.928
Oh, no.

00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:54.695
That's Dr. Faker.

00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:58.995
It's been
quite a while, Byron.

00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:02.428
Even so you're looking as
young as ever.

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.061
I can thank you
for that.

00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:06.261
I'll come do
so in person, Doctor.

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.961
Right after I get
Yuma's Numbers from him.

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:10.495
I'm sick of talking!

00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:12.528
I came
here to battle!

00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:13.861
I'm ready to duel

00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:16.728
and I'll
beat you both!

00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:18.428
We'll see about that.

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:19.995
Won't we, Byron?

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:25.395
Let's do it.

00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:27.595
Let's win
this duel, Astral!

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.661
<i>(Mr. Heartland)
And now, please direct
your attention</i>

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:33.228
to the viewing screens

00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:36.895
as I explain the rules for
the Sphere Field!

00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:38.028
This field was created

00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:41.095
so that you can
summon Numbers more easily!

00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:42.228
I'm not the one
to thank,

00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:45.061
but don't
let that stop you.

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:47.028
Now both of you can summon
a random Number

00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:49.728
simply by overlaying
two monsters in your hand

00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:51.261
with the same Level.

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:53.861
Brilliant, if I do say
so myself!

00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:55.128
However...

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:57.628
<i>if a duelist summons
a Number using this method,</i>

00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.461
<i>when it runs out of
Overlay Units,</i>

00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:00.995
<i>it will be destroyed!</i>

00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:05.961
So feel free
to use those Numbers

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:08.595
to your little hearts'
content, duelists!

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:10.728
Now it's duel time!

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:15.261
All right, I'm ready!

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:24.228
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:28.112
I'll start this off!

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:30.978
I draw!

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:34.378
I'll use the Sphere Field's
effect right away!

00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:38.078
From my hand,
I overlay two Level 4 monsters,

00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:41.812
Heraldic Beast Aberconway and
Heraldic Beast Eale!

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:46.045
He's summoning
a Number already?

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:51.012
I can hardly wait to find out
what it's going to be.

00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:55.978
I summon Number 56:
Gold Rat in defense mode!

00:10:56.012 --> 00:11:00.778
♪

00:11:04.845 --> 00:11:06.645
I end my turn.

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:08.578
You're up, Yuma.

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:10.478
Only 600
defense points.

00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:12.612
A Number like that should be
easy to beat.

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.345
(Astral)
Yuma.

00:11:14.378 --> 00:11:15.945
Is it true
that Number Cards

00:11:15.978 --> 00:11:19.345
actually have the power to
destroy this world?

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.112
Astral, why--

00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:22.812
Astral, you don't think
what Vetrix said

00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:24.345
is true, do you?

00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:26.978
I have no way of knowing.

00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:29.212
Perhaps I was sent to this
world by your father

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:32.312
to exact his revenge.

00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:34.978
Look, Astral...

00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:36.645
No way my
father would have

00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:38.678
anything to do with
revenge.

00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:43.745
And my gut tells
me you're here to help not hurt.

00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:45.978
So if the Numbers do have that
kind of power,

00:11:46.012 --> 00:11:49.212
we have to make
sure those two don't get them.

00:11:49.245 --> 00:11:51.578
Astral, don't have
any doubts.

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.812
You have to
believe in yourself,

00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:55.745
'cause I believe
in you.

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:01.978
Thank you.

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.212
I understand.

00:12:03.245 --> 00:12:05.545
Now let us focus on the business
at hand...

00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:07.245
Defeating Vetrix.

00:12:07.278 --> 00:12:08.578
Right.

00:12:08.612 --> 00:12:11.312
So I'm putting myself totally
in your hands!

00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:13.345
How do
we beat him?

00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:14.578
I have no idea.

00:12:17.378 --> 00:12:20.478
You should not depend upon me
for dueling advice, Yuma,

00:12:20.512 --> 00:12:22.745
but as usual, it
appears you have failed to make

00:12:22.778 --> 00:12:25.078
any battle plan.

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.278
Well, what did
you expect, Astral?

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:28.778
Now let's do this!

00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:30.778
All right, my turn!

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:32.612
I draw!

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:34.712
Gogogo Golem!

00:12:34.745 --> 00:12:37.045
I am so
feelin' the flow!

00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:41.245
I overlay Level 4 Gogogo Golem
and Gagaga Magician

00:12:41.278 --> 00:12:42.812
from my hand!

00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:50.245
Number 12: Crimson Shadow
Armor Ninja!

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:54.245
Come on out!

00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:03.812
Nice draw, Yuma.

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:04.978
Quite true, Bronk!

00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:08.412
It has more than enough attack
points to destroy Gold Rat!

00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:10.378
Yuma's got this in
the bag.

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.178
Go, Yuma!

00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:15.978
Crimson Shadow, attack
Gold Rat!

00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:18.612
Moon Shadow Crimson Slice!

00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:30.545
I place one card facedown and
end my turn!

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:36.645
My turn-- I draw!

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:38.045
That's right.

00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:39.612
Keep it up you two.

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:42.278
Use more power.

00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:43.912
Because more
you use,

00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:46.312
the deeper
you'll fall into my trap.

00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:49.412
Lucky me!

00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:52.278
I have two more Level 4
monsters in my hand!

00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:57.278
I overlay
Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle

00:13:57.312 --> 00:13:59.212
and Aberconway!

00:14:00.678 --> 00:14:02.878
I summon Number 10...

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:06.412
... Illumiknight!

00:14:12.845 --> 00:14:14.045
Illumiknight!

00:14:14.078 --> 00:14:16.045
That was Kite's Number!

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.445
Really?

00:14:17.478 --> 00:14:21.778
Well, I guess Kite wasn't
totally useless after all.

00:14:21.812 --> 00:14:23.645
Vetrix, you dirty--

00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:26.445
Do not let his words
anger you!

00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:29.078
I use one of Illumiknight's
Overlay Units

00:14:29.112 --> 00:14:32.945
to send one card
in my hand to the graveyard!

00:14:34.578 --> 00:14:38.145
Then I draw one card
from my deck.

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:41.278
And since I sent
Aberconway to the graveyard,

00:14:41.312 --> 00:14:44.878
its special ability
activates.

00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:48.012
I banish one
Aberconway from my graveyard

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:50.778
to return another Aberconway
from my graveyard

00:14:50.812 --> 00:14:52.345
to my hand.

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:54.278
He is not yet done.

00:14:54.312 --> 00:14:59.312
I overlay Level 4 Heraldic Beast
Aberconway and Leo!

00:15:01.578 --> 00:15:04.345
I summon Number 30...

00:15:07.512 --> 00:15:09.912
... Acid Golem of Destruction!

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.678
Check it
out: two Numbers!

00:15:15.712 --> 00:15:17.512
And I'm
not finished yet.

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.812
I've got even more
for you.

00:15:19.845 --> 00:15:23.512
I overlay
two Heraldic Beast Unicorns!

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:29.112
Now I summon
Number 8.

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:31.845
Heraldic King Genom-Heritage.

00:15:44.112 --> 00:15:46.278
Not an
encouraging development.

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.912
Now he
has three Numbers!

00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:54.171
You don't know
this, Yuma,

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.837
but Genom-Heritage has
a variety of special abilities.

00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:02.438
Just watch this!

00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:04.671
I use an
Overlay Unit to activate

00:16:04.704 --> 00:16:07.904
one of Genom-Heritage's
special abilities,

00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:10.504
and your monster's
attack points drop to zero

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:13.238
until the end of
the turn!

00:16:16.604 --> 00:16:20.004
Say goodbye to your Crimson
Shadow's attack points!

00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:22.704
Now they and your
monsters' very essence

00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:25.038
belong to Genom-Heritage!

00:16:30.704 --> 00:16:32.571
This is bad.
I agree.

00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:37.271
Genom-Heritage, show them
the wrath of their own monster!

00:16:37.304 --> 00:16:39.038
I'll use
Crimson Shadow's special --

00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:40.338
Yuma wait!

00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.438
Use a trap.

00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:44.104
Even if you use Crimson Shadow's
special ability,

00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:45.938
you will
still take damage.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:49.904
If Vetrix attacks with his next
monster, he will win.

00:16:49.938 --> 00:16:51.271
Gotcha.

00:16:51.304 --> 00:16:53.938
I activate
the trap card Half Guard!

00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:57.004
Not only does it prevent
Crimson Shadow from destruction,

00:16:57.038 --> 00:16:59.204
but Half Guard switches it
to defense mode

00:16:59.238 --> 00:17:01.538
to protect your
life points going forward.

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:17.138
Hey Astral,
sweet suggestion.

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:18.904
Now we're good.

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.971
So, you think your safe
now do you?

00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:23.471
Well, you're not!

00:17:23.504 --> 00:17:26.438
Go, attack
him Acid Golem!

00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:28.271
Acid Splash!

00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:38.371
I activate Crimson Shadow's
special ability!

00:17:38.404 --> 00:17:39.904
By using
one Overlay Unit,

00:17:39.938 --> 00:17:42.371
Crimson Shadow won't
be destroyed!

00:17:45.138 --> 00:17:46.971
Then how about
this?

00:17:47.004 --> 00:17:48.738
Go, Illumiknight!

00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:51.238
Destroy Crimson Shadow!

00:17:53.304 --> 00:17:55.838
I activate
Crimson Shadow's ability!

00:17:55.871 --> 00:17:57.504
By using another
Overlay Unit,

00:17:57.538 --> 00:17:59.338
it's still alive.

00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:07.671
We're not
beat yet, Vetrix.

00:18:07.704 --> 00:18:08.738
Oh, really?

00:18:08.771 --> 00:18:10.171
Maybe you haven't noticed
your monster

00:18:10.204 --> 00:18:12.204
has run out
of Overlay Units.

00:18:12.238 --> 00:18:14.938
Now, thanks to the Sphere
Field's effect,

00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:17.671
your
Crimson Shadow is destroyed.

00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.838
Yuma.

00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.638
This is
a disaster.

00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:28.471
If Yuma
hadn't had that trap,

00:18:28.504 --> 00:18:30.171
he would've lost
already.

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:34.638
It's your
turn now, Yuma.

00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:35.871
I'll show you.

00:18:35.904 --> 00:18:37.571
Stay focused, Yuma.

00:18:37.604 --> 00:18:40.038
If you can feel the flow you
can do this.

00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:41.938
Yeah, watch me.

00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:43.138
My turn!

00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:45.438
I draw!

00:18:45.471 --> 00:18:47.571
Summon a Number, Yuma!

00:18:47.604 --> 00:18:48.438
Right!

00:18:48.471 --> 00:18:51.538
I overlay
Bacon Saver and Flelf!

00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:57.504
Appear, Number 34,
Terror-Byte!

00:19:07.871 --> 00:19:10.338
Yuma, activate a
spell now!

00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:13.304
I activate Xyz Treasure!

00:19:13.338 --> 00:19:14.871
This lets
me draw a card for every

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.138
Xyz Monster on
the field.

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:23.138
There are four
Numbers on the field, so...

00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:28.204
I draw four cards!

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:31.804
Here we go!

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.238
I overlay Amarylease

00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:35.338
and Stinging Swordsman
from my hand!

00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:43.804
Now I summon
Number 17, Leviathan Dragon!

00:19:55.104 --> 00:19:59.571
Next up, I overlay Rai Rider
and Zubaba Knight!

00:20:10.071 --> 00:20:11.604
Nice, it's here!

00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:15.971
Come on out
Number 39: Utopia!

00:20:16.004 --> 00:20:21.804
♪

00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:34.704
Smart moves, Yuma.

00:20:34.738 --> 00:20:38.238
Now Yuma and Vetrix both have
three Numbers!

00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:42.338
Yuma, you've got
to win.

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:46.638
<i>(Mr. Heartland)
Now each duelist has
summoned three powerful
Numbers!</i>

00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:49.204
<i>Whom will lady luck smile
upon today?</i>

00:20:49.238 --> 00:20:53.971
<i>It's down to the wire
and these duelists are on fire!</i>

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:54.738
<i>Ouch.</i>

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.471
Yuma, the real battle begins
right now.

00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:01.404
Let's get
the party started.

00:21:02.871 --> 00:21:05.304
Believe me, Yuma, this
will be a party,

00:21:05.338 --> 00:21:07.171
but not for you!

00:21:07.204 --> 00:21:08.138
Yeah?

00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:10.630
Well, I'm here to prove how
wrong you are.
