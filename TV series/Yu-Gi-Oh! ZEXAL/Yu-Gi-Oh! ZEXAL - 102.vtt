00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:02.536
(Yuma)
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL...

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.940
(Yuma)
Hey guys, that's where
the Mythyrian Number is.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.476
Hello, Yuma.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.244
Vector!

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:11.945
I hate to break
the news to you, Yuma,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.482
but I've already taken the
Number you came here for...

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.116
Why you...

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.186
Let's have a duel and
the winner gets the Number.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.893
Yuma!

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:26.727
I suppose I should mention

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.897
you 're not the one who' s
doing the dueling...

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.999
Astral is.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:34.468
This can't be!

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.036
Here's the Number.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:36.837
Shall we start?

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.273
Does this mean you have
teamed with that Barian?

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.576
He sought me out and
begged me and I agreed.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.011
(both)
Let us duel!

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.846
When Utopia's
attack points change,

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.949
you take damage equal
to the change!

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.619
(loud thumping)

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.555
What's that?

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.455
(screaming)

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.424
This Labyrinth of Screams
is a trap that makes

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.928
every one of your
moves extremely dangerous.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:05.165
And so if you win...
Yuma doesn't.

(screaming)

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.634
Yuma, no!

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.105
This isn't dueling!

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:19.539
This is insane!

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:24.277
Call it whatever you
like, Yuma, but I'm loving it.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.780
Quick Yuma, look out!

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.515
(screaming)

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.386
(Number 96)
Well, Astral...

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.589
even someone as clueless
as you can plainly see

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.959
that I am in total
control of this duel.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:43.096
Every time Number 96 takes
damage, that thing swoops in

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.631
to try to knock Yuma off.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.235
(Rio)
When Astral tries to attack,
it puts Yuma in danger.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.003
(Tori)
It's just awful.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:56.076
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:58.912
Now it's my move!

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.213
I draw!

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.849
I summon Malicevorous Knife!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.951
When I summon this monster,
I can summon

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.021
another Malicevorous
monster from my graveyard!

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.558
So I think I'll cut you down
to size by summoning

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.161
another Malicevorous Knife!

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:14.995
Now Astral...

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:18.865
I'll show you the Number
you hoped to acquire!

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:23.503
I overlay two
Malicevorous Knives!

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:27.374
With these two monsters, I build
the Overlay Network!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.546
I Xyz Summon
Number 65: Djinn Buster!

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.761
Number 96: Dark Mist
attack Utopia!

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:52.499
And now Dark Mist's
special ability activates!

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.335
By using one Overlay Unit,
Utopia loses

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.803
half of its attack points...

00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:00.741
and those points
now belong to Dark Mist!

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.610
Aren't you gonna use
Guard Robe Exchange?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.547
It's your best move...
or don't you realize that?

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.582
Do it, Astral!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.349
What are you waiting for!

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.820
It'll take out a huge chunk
of 96's life points!

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.292
But if he attacks
then you'll be in danger!

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:22.429
Dark Mist, take out Utopia!

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.965
I activate Utopia's
special ability!

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.269
By using one Overlay Unit, your
monster's attack is negated.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.272
Go Light Wing Shield!

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:39.146
Then I 'll use Djinn Buster' s
special ability!

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.781
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:45.018
your Utopia's special
ability goes bye-bye!

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.424
That's not all.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:55.328
You take 500 points of damage.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.535
And Dark Mist
isn't through with you!

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.238
This time... crush Utopia!

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.845
And there's more!

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:16.116
Now Djinn Buster, attack Astral!

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.853
(gasping)

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.356
Ah...

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:27.861
Astral, no!

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.462
Astral!

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.764
I wish I could help.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:31.731
(Vector)
Yuma!

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.768
I can't tell you how
great it feels to see you

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.236
in so much distress.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.639
I believe I'll end my turn.

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:41.942
Orbital, are
you absolutely sure?

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:42.709
(Orbital)
<i>Yes.</i>

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.846
<i>There was a gravitational</i>
distortion at Area 34.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:49.015
I hope it's the Barians!

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.117
My turn.

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.018
I draw!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.522
I activate the spell card
Xyz Treasure!

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.726
This card allows me to draw
one card for every Xyz Monster

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.195
on the field.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.798
There are two Xyz Monsters
on the field.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.968
So I draw two cards.

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.070
Now I summon Explossum!

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.740
This card equips on to one
of your Xyz Monsters!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.144
Explossum...

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.714
prepare to have a blast!

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.916
It is the countdown
to your defeat!

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.418
When your Dark Mist
runs out of Overlay Units,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:29.489
Explossum explodes,
destroying your monster.

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:34.261
Dark Mist has only
one Overlay Unit left,

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.030
so the next time it uses
its special ability,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.333
it will trigger
its own destruction!

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.535
How did he think of that?

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.236
Brilliant move.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.572
This way Astral
can destroy Dark Mist

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.141
without dealing damage to 96.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.077
Awesome, Astral!

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.579
An awesome fool.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.248
Djinn Buster's
special ability activates!

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.486
It uses one Overlay Unit to
negate your Explossum's

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:02.622
special ability.

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.494
So Explossum's
ability has been defused

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:11.364
and you take 500 points
of damage, Astral!

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:20.507
You okay?

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:26.479
Furthermore, Explossum only
has 100 attack points!

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.848
And my Small Stopper
doesn't let any monster

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.084
with a 1,000 or less attack
points attack!

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:34.120
And for the coup de grâce, you
take a thousand 1,000 points

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.022
of damage if
Explossum doesn't attack.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.925
So with only 100 Life
Points left...

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.927
It's over, Astral.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:45.699
As long as I have a
turn, nothing is over, 96!

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:46.333
My move.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.301
What's the point in continuing?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.904
Your defeat is inevitable.

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.739
We shall see.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:53.773
We shall.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:59.379
I activate... the spell
Tribute Ticket from my hand!

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:00.547
When I tribute my monster,

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.984
it counts as two
monsters instead of one!

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:10.957
That allows me to summon
Swordsman of Revealing Light

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.792
in defense mode!

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.829
This monster is so powerful
that not only does it stop

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.063
one of your monster's attacks,

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:20.934
but it cannot be destroyed in
battle once per turn!

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:21.601
That's genius.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.570
Since your Swordsman's
in defense mode,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.106
Small Stopper doesn't activate!

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.574
(Tori)
Yuma!

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.210
Astral's found a good defense.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.946
I guess but is it good enough?

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.180
Why fight?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.181
Give up.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:35.749
I will not.

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:38.885
Victory and defeat are
never known until a duel ends.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:41.955
You only have
100 life points left...

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:44.224
yet you still have hope.

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.558
Hope is your enemy.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.494
You put your hope in
the hands of a human

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.295
who swore he was
your friend to the end.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.931
But the second he thought it
would do him some good,

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.366
he lied to you...

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.201
betrayed you.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.370
That friendship... It's
a burden,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.172
a weight you're forced to carry.

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.574
But you put your hope in
the wrong place, Astral.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:05.445
You put your hope in Yuma
Tsukumo... a traitor.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:09.249
The fact is the only
real hope you have is me.

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:11.618
And how is that?

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:12.919
You mean you haven't figured out

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.221
why you can't absorb
Chaos Numbers?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.724
It's so obvious.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:21.394
You don't have my power!

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:25.498
You can never gather all the
Numbers without my help, Astral.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.934
You allow your emotions to
get the best of you...

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:32.172
and as a result, you still try
to protect your friend the liar!

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:33.406
(Yuma)
Astral...

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.775
You have to beat him!

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:36.910
I'll be okay.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.645
Just beat him!

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.482
I must keep him
out of harm's way.

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:45.218
I end my turn, 96.

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.352
My move!

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:47.220
I draw!

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.255
I've acquired
new powers, Astral.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.292
Now I'll show you just
what that means!

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.397
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Barian's Force!

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:00.066
This card ranks
up my Xyz Monster,

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.168
and summons a Chaos Xyz Monster.

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:06.606
I rebuild the Overlay Network
with Rank 2 Djinn Buster!

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.876
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:18.351
Now appear, Chaos Number 65:
King Overfiend!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.366
King Overfiend's
special ability activates!

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.235
As long as it's on the field,

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:39.372
your monsters' special
abilities don't work.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:45.678
That means you can no
longer stop my attacks!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:51.818
(Vector)
Your iron-clad defense has
been destroyed Astral.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:52.218
So what?

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.088
Astral's monster still has
way more defense points!

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.857
There's no way your
Number can destroy it!

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.093
We'll see about that.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:04.364
King Overfiend's other
special ability activates!

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:08.468
By using one Chaos Overlay Unit,
Swordsman Of Revealing Light

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:12.705
loses 1,000 attack
and defense points!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:16.910
Now Dark Mist...

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.780
destroy Swordsman
Of Revealing Light!

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:24.817
I'm not done yet.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:29.055
King Overfiend attack
Astral directly!

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.758
Oh, no!

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.826
If this attack hits...

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.395
Astral loses.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.164
I activate the trap Xyz Reborn!

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:42.068
This brings back an
Xyz Monster from my graveyard.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:46.239
Return, Number 39:
Utopia!

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.845
Furthermore, Xyz Reborn becomes
an Overlay Unit for Utopia.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.784
This guy's a pain.

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.085
King Overfiend...

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.853
stop your attack!

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.021
No biggie.

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:05.658
Thanks to King Overfiend, utopia
can't use its special abilities.

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:09.062
And if you attack me,
you put Yuma in danger!

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.129
Face it, Astral.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:11.397
You're through!

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.601
This can't be.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:15.568
(Yuma)
It's my fault.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.503
If Astral wasn't protecting me,

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.773
he could duel the way
he needs to!

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:25.645
If Astral loses the duel,

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.314
he's gonna disappear
and I'll never...

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.849
I'll never forgive...

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:31.751
(Astral)
Yuma, listen to me.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.022
Focus on what is happening,
not what might.

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.056
Look at your surroundings.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:41.461
Is it possible to change your
adversity into your advantage?

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:41.894
But...

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:45.198
I don't know what can I do!

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:46.199
There's nothing I...

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:49.469
Do not think that way!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.410
What I can do?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.713
What can I do to help you?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.321
Yuma, I have faith in you.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.957
Just think.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.458
I got it!

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.694
I have to find a way to
get off of here,

00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:17.864
so Astral doesn't
have to worry about me!

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.401
There!

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:25.171
If I could just get
over to that other pillar...

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:28.741
But how?

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.714
There's one way.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:36.516
Well, Astral...

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:40.553
I think it's time you and Yuma
said your goodbyes, don't you?

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:43.156
This duel is not over yet.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.692
You only have
100 life points left.

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.927
Why don't you give up?

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.266
All right.

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:56.269
I end my turn!

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.938
(Yuma)
What if I fail?

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.740
I...

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.812
Hey....

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:08.448
My dad's coin.

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:08.881
Okay.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.850
Astral can't win unless
I get off of here,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.187
so it's just
like my dad taught me.

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:17.990
I'm gonna high five the sky!

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:19.759
What is he...

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.761
(both)
Yuma, no!

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:29.702
(screaming)

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.677
Can't get away that easy!

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:41.481
(gasping)

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.454
I did it, Astral!

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:51.858
Now you can do whatever
it takes to beat him!

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:53.960
Yuma.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.429
You'll regret this Yuma!

00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:01.000
You may be clever but
I still have the advantage!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.568
I think not.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.469
What?

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:07.206
In fact, my victory
is now inevitable.

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.641
My turn.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.209
I draw!

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.879
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:15.882
Appear, Chaos Number 39.

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:19.185
Utopia Ray!

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:35.067
I activate the trap
Superior Overlay!

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:39.539
If my monster has more Overlay
Units than your monsters,

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:42.942
all your monsters are destroyed!

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.113
Astral has two Overlay Units
on Utopia Ray.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:51.083
Number 96 has
only one on Dark Mist.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:55.288
But that means my field
will be empty!

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:55.688
Perhaps.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.491
However, you are allowed
to remove one Overlay Unit

00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:02.795
from Dark Mist in order to save
it from destruction.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:06.232
The choice is yours, Number 96.

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:13.339
I remove Dark Mist's Overlay
Unit so it's not destroyed!

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:17.276
All right!

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.911
Since it lost its Overlay Unit,

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.847
it can't use its
special ability!

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:24.584
How did he turn the duel
around with just one card?

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.686
You knew exactly what
you were going to do

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:30.456
before the duel
even began, didn't you?

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.391
Of course I did.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.659
But how?

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.227
Quite simply.

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:40.399
You overestimated your strategy
and underestimated Yuma and me.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.133
You!

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.935
How dare you make a fool of me?

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:47.507
I activate Utopia Ray's
special ability!

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.843
Utopia Ray gains
500 attack points for each

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.246
of its Overlay Units!

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:55.515
Overlay Charge!

00:16:57.049 --> 00:17:02.221
And your monster loses 1,000
attack points for every one!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.593
Your defeat is unavoidable!

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.896
It's not over.

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:11.964
Go, Utopia Ray!

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:15.501
Attack Dark Mist!

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:19.105
This duel isn't
over by a longshot!

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:21.274
I activate the trap...

00:17:21.274 --> 00:17:22.742
Chaos return!

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.678
This card stops your attack!

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:30.583
I see.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:36.055
I discard one card and activate
a spell card from the graveyard.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:40.526
I chose to activate
Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force!

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.707
And now I overlay
Rank 2 Dark Mist!

00:17:54.707 --> 00:18:00.079
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.616
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.358
Appear...

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:16.529
Chaos Number 96!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.567
Dark Storm!

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.871
(laughing maniacally)

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:34.146
(Yuma)
What's going on?

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.816
(growling)

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.119
What do you all think?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.321
Doesn't this new look
suit me perfectly?

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:46.292
Oh, man... What did that
Barian card I gave him do?

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:50.329
My trap Chaos Return's other
effect activates!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.698
Remember how I stopped
Utopia Ray's attack?

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.669
Well, that was only temporary
because it has to attack now!

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:57.536
What's he planning?

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:00.439
I 'll bet he' s got something
nasty up his sleeve.

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:02.875
I don't think
Astral expected this.

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:06.379
Dark Storm's
special ability activates!

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.780
Bad news, Astral...

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.315
When it's destroyed in battle,

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.952
both players take
the battle damage!

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:14.787
Both of us?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.797
♪♪

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:41.213
It's...
it's a draw.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:45.017
I did not win, but
I did not lose.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.620
How frustrating.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.487
In that case...

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:52.058
I'll destroy this
place and all of you with it!

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:54.760
(rumbling)

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:58.097
It 's comin' down!

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:09.642
Well, Astral... we'll
settle this another time.

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:12.812
I have no doubt we will.

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:15.281
(screaming)
Yuma!

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.785
Thanks for the lift!

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.253
The Barians are back, Kite!

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.956
Can't wait to hear

So you guys are
on a scavenger hunt

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.136
looking for seven
special Numbers?

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:37.803
(Yuma)
Yep.

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:40.539
We already got one, but
the Barians got the Number

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.508
that was in there.

That was close.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:53.185
Good thing the Number's
safe with us.

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.487
No thanks to you.

00:20:54.487 --> 00:20:56.856
I should never
have trusted your plan.

00:20:56.856 --> 00:21:00.526
It was almost as weak as
you are, Vector.

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:01.560
How dare you!

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.230
If I have need for
you again, I'll find you.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.966
Let's hope I never get
that desperate.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.068
I order you to stop!

Let him go.

Don Thousand!

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.306
Everything is going as planned.

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:19.245
Besides, I have a
more important task for you.

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:20.146
What?

00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:23.616
It is time to awaken them.
