[♪...]

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.260
YUMA: There was nothing
I could do stop Kite

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.490
KITE: There is no escape
now my little friend

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.130
you and your numbers
will be hunted down!

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.160
That guy's in a whole
different league than me.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.030
Astral: It is my fault we almost
lost to that number Hunter.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.630
And now your soul
and number cards.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.890
Will be mine!

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.960
Galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.790
Prepare to attack!

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.430
If the duel had not been
stopped, then I

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.460
I would have vanished
from here forever.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
Totally meant to do that.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.560
Ya' know something needs to
seriously change here,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.530
astral. You've spent the last
couple days staring at walls

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.630
and making bummer comments.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.430
I cannot help it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.560
listen!

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.860
You gotta get it together!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.060
Avoiding that guy Kite
isn't an option.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.990
He's gonna come
for us eventually.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.130
And when he does, we
need to be ready!

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.530
But if we are not, and we lose.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.890
You're supposed to be
the one giving me

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.090
big inspiring speeches.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.490
You can't be sitting around and

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.090
TORI: Hey!

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.090
Hey, guys, what's up?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.530
World duel carnival?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.630
Bronk: Yeah!

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.190
It's like a tournament
or something.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.730
They're gonna be holding the
whole thing in heartland.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.990
And like

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.160
these really incredible
duelists from all over the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.630
world, like places we've
never even heard of,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.560
are gonna be there!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.660
I bet Kite's gonna be there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.090
what's wrong?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.360
You don't seem psyched.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.960
Grandma: Yuma

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.190
ALL: Grandma!

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.490
When'd you get here?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.360
I need you to be a sweetheart
and take these to an

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.590
old friend of mine who
lives out of town a ways.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.530
There's a note in there, too.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.290
Looks really heavy, c'mon,
today's saturday, grandma.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.030
Who are you and what
have you done with my

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660
kind and generous grandson?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.560
Where is he!?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.660
I'm right here!

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.090
And I, I - I'll do it.

I hope you're
comfortable up there.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
How's the view?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.230
Sunset nice?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.660
Everytime I think we're
at the top, there's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.690
more steps, it never ends.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.990
My legs Feel like jelly!

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.360
Well Then try lookin' at it this
way, yuma, if we turn around

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.060
now, you'll have to carry that
bag all the way back.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.630
You're right!

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.060
I can totally do this.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.990
I just have to feel the flow!

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.590
Uh, what is this place?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.830
Special delivery!

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.560
Hey, is anybody home?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.460
Argh!

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.690
What's wrong?!

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.290
monkey attack, monkey
attack, monkey attack,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.660
monkey attack, monkey
attack, geh, geh, geh!

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.060
There's a monkey on my back!

ROKU: Friends!

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.690
You got any dipping sauce?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.530
That "Monkey" Looks
like an old man.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.430
Yeah!

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.060
A full belly is
indeed a happy belly!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.190
Be sure and give
my thanks to haru!

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.760
Did you "Haru?"
you mean my grandma?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.060
Uuh, so how do you two know each
other, old-Timer?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.660
"Old-Timer?!"

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.290
the name happens to be roku, but
you can call me master roku!

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.860
All: "master roku??"

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.090
KARI: You sent yuma to
the duel sanctuary?

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.490
Grandma!

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.460
The more yuma gets involved with
all this duel stuff, the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.530
more danger he's gonna be in,
think about mom and dad.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.530
I'd love nothing more than to
keep our yuma safe

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.560
forever, but you and I both know
there's no stopping his passion

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.530
for dueling, we might as well

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.190
prepare him for what lies ahead.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.730
And what "lies ahead?"

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.830
ALL: Huh!?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.060
"Can't go home?"

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.630
you've missed the last
bus by about an hour.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.360
And everyone around here
calls it a day at sundown.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.330
So then we'll walk.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.360
But then you wouldn't be able to
clean this room for me.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.090
Whaddya mean, "clean this room?"

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.890
this place is a mess, that
would take us forever.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.330
Then you better get started.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.760
Your grandmother's note said
you would do anything

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.230
I asked you to do.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.590
Your sweet little granny's
not a liar, is she?

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.960
Of course not, but the!

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.630
Put all that stuff in
the back closet bronk.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.130
Yuma!

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.390
You aren't helping any.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.060
But, I'm trying, and,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.460
this Broom is defective,
yeah, that's it,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.290
hey.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.290
I wonder what the old
man's got in that room.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.390
Whoa, it's dark magician!

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.490
And blue-Eyes white Dragon!

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.590
And!

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.590
And, and

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.790
and!

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.760
Red-Eyes, wow, there's
neos, and, oh man, it's!

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.330
Dark magician girl!

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.760
All the legendary
monsters in one place!

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.030
Wow!

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.690
Yuma, stop
trying to get outta

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.090
what's in here?

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.090
Whoa, this is awesome!

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.630
I'm glad you like them.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.130
I poured my heart and soul into
making these wooden

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.590
statues, every time one of my
little Birdies flies from the

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.290
nest, I carve a new one
in his or her honor.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.360
"Little birdies?"

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.390
Yes.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.460
My students, my protegees,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.690
this historical duel sanctuary
is a training house,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.330
a place of knowledge.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.690
Many incredible duelists
Have mastered their art

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.690
in this very room.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.360
Wow, that is so cool, and so are
these statues, they look

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.760
like they're about to move.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.190
But they do move.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.230
No they don't.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.230
Are you serious?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.730
I am.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.760
During a duel, these
statues come to life!

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.490
Do you want to see?

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.060
Hmm?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.230
Get set to get decked old-Timer!

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.590
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.830
Let's duel!

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.890
In This duel training scenario,
two legends have already been

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.930
summoned to each of our fields.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.890
I've got blue-Eyes statue Dragon
and red-Eyes statue Dragon.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.130
You have statue dark magician
and statue dark magician girl.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.960
The decks we're using
are wooden training decks

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.330
made by yours truly.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.390
Now, the four legendary monsters
on our fields

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.630
remain as wooden statues.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.590
Their powers are sealed away,
they have zero attack points.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.560
They cannot engage in battle.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.860
They what?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.390
So you were kidding when you
said they could move.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.760
You can say they can move.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760
You can believe
that they cannot.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.530
That choice is yours to make.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.130
Eeh!

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.390
I see,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.190
the potential of these
monsters depends on

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.130
the decisions yuma makes

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.260
yuma, you have the power to
bring them to life.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.560
But he just,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.830
one of the cards in
your deck must be the key

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.990
to unlocking their powers.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.860
So you mean

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.930
oh!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.490
I get it!

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.790
Should I get comfy?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.290
Maybe make myself some tea?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.430
Back on your feet, gramps!

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.860
Cause here I go, I draw!

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.060
Whoa, sweet!

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.560
I'm activating, the
statue zone field spell!

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.260
Oh!

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.490
This field spell
removes the Seal placed

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.530
on All statue monsters!

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.590
Come on, everyone!

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.390
Let's feel the flow!

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.890
This is so amazing!!

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.530
wooo!

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.230
Legendary monsters are
officially in the house!

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.160
This is, like, the greatest
thing I've ever seen ever!

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.660
Alright, dark magician!

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.790
Let's do this!

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.660
Attack his red-Eyes!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.690
Dark Magic attack!

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.930
Hoohoo, not too bad,
little scrapper

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.260
aw, yeeah!

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.530
This is so great!

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.730
Question, you may've made a
monster move,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.630
but can you truly
move a monster?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.830
What are you talking about?

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.860
I just destroyed
red-Eyes with dark magician!

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.190
Perhaps you need a new
perspective.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160
What's

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.390
what, what's going on?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.730
Argh!

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.560
Eh!?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.830
what am I holding!?

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.260
This looks like

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.530
I'm dark magician!

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.430
I'm dark magician

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.830
easy now, good, Dragon

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.930
whoa, that's

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.390
that's me.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.790
No way!

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.890
This is quite and
interesting scenario

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.760
This is really freaking me out.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.390
Look alive, Sonny!

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.130
C It's my turn now!

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:08.690
I activate a spell
polymerization!

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.960
And now I fuse three blue eyes
white-Dragon's

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.190
from my graveyard and
hand, to fusion summon

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.390
blue-Eyes ultimate
statue Dragon!

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.560
Haha!

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.730
Now my ultimate Dragon - Attack
dark magician girl!

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.960
Neutron Blast attack!

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.860
Dark magician girl!

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.630
Next I activate the de-Fusion
spell card from my hand!

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.260
So by Sending my blue-Eyes
utlimate Dragon to my extra

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.960
deck, it splits apart, and now I
have three blue-Eyes white

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.360
Dragon's again!

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.330
Wait!

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.330
Don't do it!

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.760
Don't attack!

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.860
Yes, when staring into the eyes
of a powerful foe, you tremble

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.790
in fear, it's only natural.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.490
Our monsters are no different.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:28.160
They are forced to confront
their fears every time we duel.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.430
Feel the terror!

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.760
Buckle under the weight of
your fear, tremble as

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.160
my blue-Eyes attack
you directly!

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.960
Go White lightning!

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.660
He lost!

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.730
I may have pushed
you a little too hard.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.630
But you felt it, didn't you?

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.460
You felt the fear a monster must
wrestle with every

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.090
time you summon it
to battle in your name.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.460
When you learn to make that fear
your own, and when you master

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.690
how to tame it, only
then will you truly be

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.330
able to move a monster.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.030
I can't believe it,
I never really knew.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.960
I always figured monsters
weren't afraid of anything

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.860
but that's not True,
they're just like me.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.160
This is Boring

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.490
yuma, weren't we gonna
catch a movie today?

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.690
If you guys wanna take off, go
ahead, I think

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.690
I'm gonna stick
around a little longer.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.160
These statues
won't clean themselves

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.390
in that case, I'll whip
up some breakfast.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.560
Wait!

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.630
But

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.090
supposed to go to a movie.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.090
Morning!

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.030
Hey!

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.960
How did this happen?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.160
This statue's all
messed up right here.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.630
It's, it's almost like it was
cut in half and put back

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.930
together, did someone
break this once?

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.590
Why would anyone do that?

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.630
That boy has a good spirit, he's
a diamond just waiting to shine

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.960
he's the opposite of him.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.760
It, it's you.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.790
Kaze: Yes it is, "master"

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.490
I'm back.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.390
Didn't think you'd
see me again, did you?

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.160
I did not, after all, I said you
were never to come back here.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.590
You told me a lot
of things, old man

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.030
But words are cheap.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.060
Let's duel!

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.530
Hey!

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.190
Uh, can I help you?

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.460
And who are you?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.030
Yuma!

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.590
What happened?!

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.790
get away, my boy.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.930
Uh.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.230
Away from what?

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.230
You mean this guy?

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.290
Who is he?

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.530
Kaze, a former pupil of mine.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.630
You lose again.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.830
And you will keep Losing if you
let your anger blind you.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.230
I told you not to play that
card, why did you not listen?

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.760
You will never control the
darkness inside you unless you

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.090
kaze!

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.560
Don't listen to your rage!

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.460
Kaze!

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.060
Leave this place, now.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.890
One day, I will defeat you and
the legendary deck will be mine!

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.290
That day has finally arrived,

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.330
roku, I'm the master now,
where's the deck?

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.030
I think I accidentally
threw it away.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.690
You think I'm joking!?

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.790
your spirit's been corroded by
darkness, you don't deserve to

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.830
even look at the legendary deck!

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.730
I'll destroy everything
here if I have to!

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.060
Oh no you won't!

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.160
Yuma, no!

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.590
Walk away, you runt, this does
not concern you.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.030
Yeah it does, 'cause roku

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.860
roku is my master!

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.090
Use what I have taught and
victory will be yours.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.360
Ha!

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.430
I guess that senile old fool
will take anyone in

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.690
whatever you're after, you're
gonna have to go

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.860
through me to get it.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.190
Is that so? That
won't be a problem.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.890
Duel disk go!

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.060
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.190
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.160
Let's duel!

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.030
I have a bad feeling about this

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.030
I am right by your side, yuma.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.160
Astral?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.460
I thought I was on my
own for this one!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.560
I believe I have a lot
to learn from this old man.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.030
That makes me his student, too.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.890
Then let's school this fool!

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.930
It's my turn!

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.590
I draw!

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.290
I summon gagaga magician!

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.890
Next, I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.290
What a joke

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.930
I draw!

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.290
I summon flame armor ninja!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.990
Then from my hand, I activate
the spell card armor ninjitsu

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.030
art of teleportation.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.530
The power of this card allows me
to summon a ninja

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.430
monster from my hand.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.560
Behold, air armor ninja!

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.090
Due to teleportation's effect.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.960
My ninjas can't attack.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.060
However

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.090
I don't think I like

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.130
where this is going

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.830
I can overlay flame armor
ninja and air armor ninja!

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.160
With These two monsters, I build
the overlay network and xyz

00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:01.230
summon, blade armor ninja!

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.060
Yikes, that didn't take
long, did it astral?

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.060
No, it did not, and
that is worrisome.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.460
And now blade Armor ninja
attack gagaga magician!

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.660
That's not happenin'
on my watch!

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.290
I play the trap gagaga shield!

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.660
Now my magician can use this
shield to protect itself.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.160
Nice try, ninja pants!

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.260
But my gagaga isn't
go-Go-Going anywhere.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.360
Perhaps..

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.930
but you will still
feel its sting.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.890
And now, by using
an overlay unit,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.790
blade armor ninja
can attack again!

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.930
And once again,
you take damage!

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.460
Yuma!

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.990
Poor Fool

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.490
if you hadn't tried to protect
your monster, you wouldn't

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.230
have taken any damage at all.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.730
My monsters are my friends

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.090
they're not just things who
battle for me, they're a part of

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.230
me, they've got my back, and
I've got theirs!

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.730
Your "friends?" if you want to
believe something so pathetic,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.560
go ahead, but that kind of
thinking will

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.660
lead you to your undoing.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.930
You think so?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.060
Well then give me all you've got
and let's find out!
