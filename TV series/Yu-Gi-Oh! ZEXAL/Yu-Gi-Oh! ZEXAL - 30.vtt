00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.430
Tombo: Go Pepper pounder!

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.830
Carrot crunch!

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.290
Eggstreme eggplant!

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.090
Cu-Clobber!

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.490
NISTRO: Looks like somebody had
a run-in with a produce stand.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.630
Better call it in.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.630
Dextra: We found
another downed duelist.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260
Send a unit here right
away to help him out.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.760
Whoever did This is
playing by their own rules.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.460
Check this out.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.560
Just as I thought.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.030
That stain is tomato juice.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.190

YUMA: I plan to do a
lot of dueling today,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.560
so I've gotta fill up
on some duel fuel!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.660
TORI: Yuma,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.930
please try to eat
like a human being.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930
Sorry, but I'm hungry
as an elephant!

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.760
No way!

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.460
Yo, come back you snacknapper!

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.930
That's mine!

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.030
I can't duel on
an empty stomach.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.390
You look like you need
some Energizin', my friend!

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.490
Here, Chow down
on some cucumbers!

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.330
They are Dee-Licious!

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.960
I love these.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.060
I wonder if they come
in any other flavors?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.960
Hey you're right.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.190
They're great.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.930
So, did you grow all these
vegetables yourself?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.730
Yes, ma'am!

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.960
Wow!

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.390
I'm not hungry anymore,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.860
and I'm ready to duel.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.830
Thanks uh... what's your name?

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.960
Well sir,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.690
I'm tombo tillbitty!

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.790
And I love tomatoes, more
than practically anything!

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.830
My dream is to build a huge
entertainment Park dedicated to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.230
tomatoes right here
in the big city!

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.230
A tomato amusement park?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.690
Yesiree!

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.090
Se tomatoes are the finest
and funnest vegetables on this

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.130
whole planet.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590
I wanna win the duel carnival,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.190
so I'll be set on the road to
fame and fortune and I can make

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.390
tomatotopia a reality!

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.490
Of course I need a greeter to
meet the guests When they enter

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.860
the park, and I thought...

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.630
that you would make the absolute
perfect person for the job,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.690
ma'am!

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.990
Hi!

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.130
Welcome to tomatotopia!

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.360
That's not gonna happen.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.730
There won't be a tomatotopia!

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.830
Uh Yuma...

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.290
tombo,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.630
tombo, thanks for givin' me that
cucumber, but you're not gonna

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.490
win the duel carnival
'cause I'm a better duelist.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.690
Oh really?

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.960
Prove it.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960
I plan to.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.360
Let's duel!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.130
That suits me just fine!

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.330
I've already won a
whole crop of victories

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.960
to make my dream Come True.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.160
And you'll be the next loser!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.960
Bring it on, son!

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.190
I will!

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.760
Duel Disk, go!

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.430
Let's do this!

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.060
But before we start, I'd like
to propose we add a special rule

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.690
just for fun.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.330
Hold up, what special rule?

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.230
The basket rule!

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.530
Before you attack, you gotta
pull a vegetable outta the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.030
basket and gobble it down!

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.060
You can't start your attack
until it's all eaten up.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.530
You fired up for
the challenge, son?

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.330
But it's not fair!

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.230
You can't make up
some crazy rule and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.990
expect me to go along with it!

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.290
Sounds like you're chicken!

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.460
Listen Kid, I'm a member of the
committee that approves all of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.990
the duel carnival regulations.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.960
This yokel's already caused all
kinds of chaos with his special

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.260
veggie rules, and
that's okay by me!

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.060
Hold on, nistro.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.890
I have to approve too.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.090
Aw loosen up, dextra!

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.830
Our farmer friend here just
wants to make things interesting

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.590
for his city slicker rivals.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.160
I'm glad you understand.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.360
Wait, his rules are bogus.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.760
He's gonna have a
huge advantage.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.830
The dude's a vegetable fanatic.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.660
So what's wrong with that?

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.330
Bet ya this kid's a
major junk food fanatic.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.030
They say you are what you eat.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.960
Please, that's so insulting!

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.390
I eat healthy food sometimes.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.730
Then you shouldn't have
a problem, should you?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.060
I also approve the basket rule.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.960
But lady...

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.490
bon appetit!

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.930
Hey Wait a second!

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.760
Since I'm a visitor
to these parts,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.660
why don't ya let me go first?

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.560
And now... I draw!

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.960
First up, I'll use the field
spell tomato Paradise!

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.060
This lets me muster a tomato
token whenever I summon a

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.190
plant-Type monster, and tomato

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.160
Paradise is beautiful to boot.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.990
It looks like a
tomato nightmare!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.730
Next up, I summon tomatoknight!

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.690
My tomatoknight's a
plant-Type monster,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.490
so I can summon a
tomato token too!

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.660
What is up with this guy?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.260
Why don't you summon something
original like a broccoli?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.290
to give a little zing, I'm
activating the spell tomatapult!

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.390
Not only does it let me hurl a
plant monster and hit ya for 400

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.660
points of damage, but it's

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.030
mighty entertainin' too!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.560
Ready or not, here
comes a tomato token!

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.530
Get ready to get splattered!

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.160
You're gonna need a good scrub
down after this duel is done.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.590
Now you're up.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.830
That does it, tombo!

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.030
I'll smash your
tomatoes into pulp!

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.930
Don't hold back, yuma!

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.990
I won't.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.160
I draw... and summon
my achacha Archer!

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.190
ASTRAL: It will deal 500
points of damage,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.790
and that should most likely
get this duel back on track.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.990
Yeah!

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.790
Let it fly, achacha!

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.090
Perfect,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.560
now you should attack a monster.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.530
Target his tomatoknight.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.160
Right.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.230
I forgot I can't attack.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.890
According to the rules I have to
pull a vegetable out of this

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.760
basket first and then eat it.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.390
So do it, yuma!

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.430
I was about to!

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.490
Just be careful what you pick.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.060
Ah!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.130
This seems okay.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.530
Feels like a vegetable I know.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.290
Kind of like...

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.930
an eggplant!

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.130
What is this thing?

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.290
It's a hybrid I grew crossing
an eggplant and a tomato.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.030
It's tasty to a t!

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.930
I call it an eggmato!

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.230
No way.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.790
I'll put a card facedown and
call it quits for this turn.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.890
Yuma?

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.730
This is no time to get picky!

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.230
It makes no sense
to avoid attacking.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.830
You should've struck
while you had a chance.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.330
You'll regret not eatin'
your vegetables,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.160
my fussy little friend!

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.490
My turn to... draw!

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.660
Feast your eyes on
tomato in tomato!

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.490
This card's doubly dangerous,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.530
t s cause it's ability lets
me summon another one straight

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.660
to my field!

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.130
And When ya figure in the
effect of tomato Paradise,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.090
I can add to my all-Tomato team
by summonin' up two tomato

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.760
tokens!

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.760
How many tomato cards
have you got?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.990
I got bushels full of 'em!

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.160
And here's one of my faves,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.090
the tough tomato spell card!

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.960
Now my plant-Type monster
gains 500 attack points

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.360
until the end of the turn!

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.560
And that gives 'em
plenty more ce.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.130
I've turned these cute
little critters into the

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.990
ultimate power plants!

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.960
But before I attack,
I gotta eat a veggie.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.430
Now which one will it be?

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.060
A zesty Pepper!

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.830
I'm "pepped" up!

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.690
Prepare yourself yuma.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.630
Tomatoknight go after achacha
Archer with Bullseye blast!

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.890
And now tomato in tomato is
takin' aim directly at you,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.260
better Brace yourself!

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.560
Go Tomato torrent!

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.160
Hoo-Wee!

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I can keep peltin' you with
tomato monsters till you're

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.590
knocked out!

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.660
No!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.960
Fight Back, yuma!

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.530
Now, use a trap card!

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.990
Oh Yeah!

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.490
I'll use the heartfelt appeal
trap to turn the tables on him!

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.460
Now when you hit me
with a direct attack,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.090
I get control of whichever
one of your monsters

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.490
has the most defense points.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.660
Which means your tomato in
tomato is now working as a

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.490
bodyguard for me!

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.860
Nice!

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.590
It's been quite awhile since I
saw the old tomato shield ploy,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.760
but I got some
tomato tricks of my own.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.360
Don't forget my tomatopult
is still in effect,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.660
and that monster you
took won't save ya!

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.430
Go get him guys!

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.130
That's what I call
tomato teamwork!

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.430
You're up, yuma!

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.190
I can't take anymore.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.560
Try to feel the flow.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.860
Alright, now I draw!

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.430
I tribute tomato in tomato
and summon chachaka Archer!

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.760
Quite a wise choice.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.790
No doubt you chose it because it
can destroy a spell or trap CARD

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.860
Once per turn.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.160
It can?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.360
Chachaka, use your special
ability to trash that

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.060
tomatapult! Now to power up.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.590
This card should do the trick!

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.430
My blustering winds spell will
give chachaka Archer another

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.060
1000 attack points!

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.590
Very Good work.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.090
And now you can attack.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.790
Oh, that's right.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.960
I completely forgot about...
dumb Basket rule!

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.360
Take your time...

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.030
This one feels...
familiar... like a...

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.060
cucumber!

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.330
Look at that.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
I see it has the same
color as a tomato.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.590
How can that be?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.960
That there's the tastiest
tomato Creation I ever grew!

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.730
Have a bite and I guarantee
you'll agree, yuma!

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.090
Quit Playin' games with me!

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.030
Take it easy.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.030
See, I'm just expandin' the
world of tomatoes to show how

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.430
great they are!

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.130
I think... that you're actually
trying to force me into

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.430
forfeiting our duel.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.560
What is wrong?

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.160
Pull yourself together, yuma!

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.660
That basket has turned
you into a basket case!

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.160
Noooooooooooooo!

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.760
I won't do it, sorry!

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.460
You won't?

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.860
Wait a minute, you don't
like tomatoes, do ya?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.830
That's right, it's True!

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.530
I think that tomatoes
are disgusting!

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.990
You hate tomatoes, yuma?

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.830
I admit it.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.260
I've hated them
since I was a baby!

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.330
They're horrible!

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.860
You would rather lose
than eat one of them?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.760
Yuma, you've got to
eat those vegetables!

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.060
You can't make me.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.030
Right now I'll put a card
down, and end my turn.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.230
So you're a tomato hater, huh?

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.790
When you and me started
this, it was just a duel.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.460
But now its a grudge match!

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.060
Uh oh!

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.660
I won't let you insult the
greatest vegetable on earth!

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.890
It's odious ignoramuses Like
yourself who stand in the way of

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.490
my buildin' tomatotopia!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.430
Fyi, tomatoes are
technically fruit!

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.990
So they'll never be
the greatest vegetable!

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.690
That's it.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.730
I'm gonna serve you up a heap of
hurtin' with a side of grief.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.260
Here it comes, now!

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.390
I summon tomato in tomato,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.690
and a tomato token too!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.430
Uh-oh!

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.890
I sense he is up
to something big.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.690
I'm overlayin' both
of my tomato

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.260
in tomato's plus
my tomatoknight!

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.060
Then I'm usin' them to
build the overlay network,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.490
so that I can xyz summon!

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.730
Make way for the
king of the crop,

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.930
the toughest tomato of 'em all,

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.530
all Hail the mighty tomato king!

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.930
That looks tasty.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.560
Then I'll take advantage of
tomato Paradise's effect to

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.860
summon a tomato token!

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.930
And what's more, I'll activate
tomato King's special ability.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.490
By using' an overlay unit, this
monster's attack points Double

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.230
UNTIL my next turn.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.390
Nothing can top this tomato now.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.230
Oh man, imagine running into
that freak in a grocery store!

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.860
And Look at those attack points!

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.130
3200!

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.990
Okay, get set king!

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.830
Fix your aim on chachaka Archer!

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.060
Pour on the heat
with Tomato terror!

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.630
Yuma!

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.360
That's the way!

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.760
You finished yuma off!

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.060
What?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.060
How come you still have
life points left?

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.560
When you attacked, I activated
my transaction summon trap card.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.660
This trap lowers the the
damage I take by 500,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.290
and then I can summon a
monster with 1000 or

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.730
fewer attack points.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.660
So not only did your king's
attack get totally squashed,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.360
but now I can also
bring out a super

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.390
sweet monster... like this!

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.590
Say hello to gagaga girl!

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.060
Thing is,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.290
I can't destroy your monster
in battle for a couple of your

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.630
turns.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.960
It's the price I have
to pay for using the trap.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.130
Alrighty!

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.930
Since you only have
400 life points,

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.430
I can afford to wait another
turn before my tomatoes

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.930
take you down.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.160
Go for it!

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.590
Okay tombo, I'll draw!

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.790
Come on out, gagaga magician!

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.130
I suggest you change
the card's level, yuma.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.190
Yeah!

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.930
I change gagaga
magician to level 3!

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.230
The next step holds
the key to your victory.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.430
If you choose to xyz summon now,
you will have a fighting chance

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.160
to win this duel.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.660
But first you have to reach in
that basket and eat what you

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.290
pull out.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.690
I don't know, astral.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.890
What if I pull
out another tomato?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.000
I'll have to focus with
all my power for this move!

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.390
You're up, yuma.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.330
The next step holds
the key to your victory.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.660
If you choose to xyz summon now,
you will have a fighting chance

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.260
to win this duel.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.330
But first you have
to reach in that basket

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.530
and eat what you pull out.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.830
I don't know, astral.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.790
What if I pull
out another tomato?

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.660
I'll have to focus with
all my power for this move!

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.460
hmm, here's a vegetable
i'm sure about!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.390
Hello, carrot?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.990
That's a carrot-Like
tomato I dreamt up which

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.890
I call a tomarrot!

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.560
Nooooooo!

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.630
Don't be a wimp!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.630
Eat that tomarrot!

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.790
You have no choice.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.690
That is unless
you wish to lose.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.790
I know that!

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.490
But tomatoes are yucky
and I won't eat 'em,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.630
I won't, I won't!

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.960
Okay.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.730
Tombo will win and then
you know what will happen?

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.190
He's gonna turn this whole
city into tomatotopia!

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.260
Imagine What meals will be like
around here after that happens!

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.890
Tomato Salad for lunch,
tomato pizza for dinner,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.030
and tomato duel fuel for desert!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.090
And I'll force you to
swallow every bite!

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.660
What?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.560
She sounds serious, yuma.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.360
Alright.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.560
You guys win, are you happy now?

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.790
I'll try eating the tomarrot!

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.860
Ready or not taste
buds, here I go!

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.890
Hey,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.660
Hey, I really like it!

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.590
Oh Yeah!

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.090
It's even better than
Chocolate covered pork rinds!

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.530
That's music to my ears,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.860
you've made me so proud!

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.230
I'm happy as a
Crow in a cornfield!

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.760
This is your chance, yuma.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.830
Quickly,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.860
xyz summon now!

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.290
Gotcha!

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.090
I overlay my level 3 gagaga
magician and gagaga girl in

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.360
order to build
the overlay network.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.730
I xyz summon melomelody
the brass djinn!

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.890
Whenever you use gagaga girl and
another gagaga monster to xyz

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.260
Summon, then the attack points

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.160
of your opponent's xyz
monster can be zeroed out.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.530
Go cell phone subtraction!

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.130
It's not the top tomato anymore!

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.730
Watch out, 'cause Melo the
brass djinn' s getting ready

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.760
to play. Hit it,
melomelody the brass djinn!

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.030
Blast tomato king
With Melody wave!

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.560
For right now, tomato king
won't be destroyed because of

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.290
transaction summon's effect,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.160
but you'll still take
some heavy-Duty damage.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.290
And now you can activate
melomelody the brass djinn's

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.330
special ability!

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.790
Cool!

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.490
I almost forgot that if you have
an xyz monster on your field,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.360
melomelody can use an overlay

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.890
unit and attack again!

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.330
Tombo, your tomatoes
are fantastic!

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.860
I wanna dedicate these
last attacks to them!

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.460
Here's to you, tomato king!

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.630
That was awesome, melomelody!

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.090
And now you can
go for an encore.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.190
Ready?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.430
Go ahead and attack it!

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.460
Melody wave!

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.560
Whoa, now I know what it feels
like to be a tomato when it's

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.460
just been canned!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.590
Yes!

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.490
Tombo, are you okay Buddy?

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.990
Wake up!

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.090
Yuma,

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.790
thanks.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.230
Sorry, tombo.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.790
I know how much winning
this duel meant to you.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.660
But at least you did
win over my stomach.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.330
Just think, if we hadn't dueled,
I never would've realized how

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.890
amazing tomatoes are.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.390
That's all that matters.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.930
You and me may be opponents on
the dueling field, but from now

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.860
on we'll always be brothers on

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.190
the tomato field.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.860
That's right.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.030
So long,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.730
I'm gonna miss Ya, Buddy!

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.490
Here's your heart piece.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.890
Take it easy!

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.460
That was the weirdest
duel I ever fought...

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.030
and the most tasty!

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.030
It's True.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.660
Observation number sixteen.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.160
The human stomach is as
complicated as the human brain.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.660
Oh yeah!

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.290
I'm getting to the finals even
if I have to eat my way there!
