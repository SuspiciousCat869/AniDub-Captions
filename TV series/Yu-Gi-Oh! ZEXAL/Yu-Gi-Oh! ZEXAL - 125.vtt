Now to answer the biggest
question of all.

00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:03.603
Can Nash truly turn against
his old friends?

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:07.540

Wow, that was fast.

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:53.686
(Quattro) Good move,

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:55.354
but not good enough.

00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:55.855
Now then.

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:58.991
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

00:06:58.991 --> 00:06:59.959
Up to you.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.762
Either way, the real

How did you
survive that attack?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.368
When I saw what was coming,

00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:10.036
I knew I had to use

00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:13.773
Gimmick Puppet Shadow
Feeler's special ability.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.943
Which means since you
attacked me directly,

00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:18.811
I was able to bring
my Shadow Feeler

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:21.013
back from
the graveyard to protect me.

00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:21.881
But there's more.

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.383
My Shadow Feeler isn't
destroyed in battle either,

00:07:24.383 --> 00:07:27.887
so it's gonna stick around
and play for a while.

00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:28.888
Clever move.

00:07:28.888 --> 00:07:29.789
I didn't expect that.

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:32.258
Nor did I expect
a gutless fool like you

00:07:32.258 --> 00:07:35.561
to show such courage
when hopelessly outmatched.

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:36.796
What's hopeless is getting past

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:39.031
all this bogus Barian business.

00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:39.932
Drop it.

00:07:39.932 --> 00:07:41.601
I want my friend Shark back.

00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:42.835
You deluded fool.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:44.370
I was never your friend.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.438
I never felt anything for you

00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:49.642
or anyone else except pity
at how pathetic you all are.

00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:51.010
Huh?

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:52.945
That's right, Quattro.

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:54.914
Let your anger towards me grow.

00:07:54.914 --> 00:07:58.351
It makes turning on you
so much simpler.

00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:00.553
I think he's telling the truth.

00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:03.022
Well, if I wasn't your
friend in the past,

00:08:03.022 --> 00:08:06.025
then I'll be your worst
nightmare in the present!

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:07.927
I draw!

00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:11.030
I equip Shadow Feeler
with this card...

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.698
Overlay Satellite.

00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:15.868
So now Shadow Feeler
counts as two monsters

00:08:15.868 --> 00:08:18.371
when I Xyz Summon!

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:23.309
Now, I overlay Level Eight
Shadow Feeler.

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.678
And since it
counts as two monsters,

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.813
I can build the Overlay Network

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:29.882
and Xyz Summon Number 40...

00:08:29.882 --> 00:08:32.018
Gimmick Puppet of Strings!

00:08:36.822 --> 00:08:38.391
Now Overlay Satellite becomes

00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:41.727
Gimmick Puppet of Strings'
Overlay Unit.

00:08:42.428 --> 00:08:46.032
But in exchange, Strings
can't attack this turn.

00:08:46.032 --> 00:08:46.932
What a fool.

00:08:46.932 --> 00:08:49.602
You summon a monster
that you can't even use?

00:08:49.602 --> 00:08:52.038
I would never have had
a clueless person

00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:54.340
like you for a friend.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.874
Clueless?

00:08:54.874 --> 00:08:57.009
I bet this next move
will change your mind.

00:08:57.243 --> 00:09:00.880
I activate Strings'
special ability.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.014
I use one Overlay Unit

00:09:02.248 --> 00:09:05.017
to put a String Counter
on your monster.

00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.753
Gimmick Puppet, do your thing.

00:09:12.758 --> 00:09:14.293
And since I used Shadow Feeler

00:09:14.293 --> 00:09:17.697
as an Overlay Unit,
it gets banished.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.334
Which was my plan, because it
lets me cast the spell

00:09:21.334 --> 00:09:22.335
Banish Reactor.

00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:27.373
And now, I get one card
back from the graveyard.

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:34.013
I choose Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force.

00:09:36.382 --> 00:09:37.583
Why bother to bring back

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:40.019
that phony meaningless card?

00:09:40.252 --> 00:09:41.654
You couldn't be more wrong.

00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:43.422
This card has great meaning.

00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:44.857
My brother gave it to me.

00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:47.860
He put his very heart
and soul into this card.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.629
You know how important
that is, don't you?

00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:52.031
Or have you
forgotten that duels

00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:53.899
are about a lot more
than winning?

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:56.669
You never seemed to
think they were before.

00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:59.038
No, but you and Yuma
and his friends,

00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:01.741
you all changed the way
I thought about dueling

00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:03.008
and what it really meant.

00:10:03.008 --> 00:10:04.310
And now I guess it's up to me

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.280
to teach you that same lesson
and refresh your memory.

00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:13.953
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force!

00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:16.322
Know what it does?

00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:19.458
It ranks up my Xyz Monster
to a Chaos Xyz.

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:23.028
I overlay my
Gimmick Puppet of Strings.

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:26.031
Now I rebuild
the Overlay Network.

00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:28.768
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:33.038
Appear, Chaos Number 40...

00:10:33.038 --> 00:10:36.275
Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings!

00:10:42.848 --> 00:10:45.418
I am not impressed, Quattro.

00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:46.986
Believe me, you will be.

00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:49.588
Dark Strings destroys
all monsters

00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:50.923
with a String Counter,

00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:54.326
so Silent Honor Dark
is destroyed.

00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:59.565
Symphony of Destruction!

00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:03.702
Now you lose
life points equal to your

00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:06.572
Silent Honor Dark's
attack points.

00:11:08.674 --> 00:11:09.542
So watch out.

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:11.744
It's gonna rain some pain.

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:13.345
Hope you're ready.

00:11:18.584 --> 00:11:20.753
(yelling)

00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:26.025
Dark Strings
has another ability.

00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:28.594
You see, when it destroys
your monster,

00:11:28.594 --> 00:11:31.030
I get to draw one more card.

00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:34.033
(Shark)
Quattro doesn't know it,

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:35.734
but the angrier he makes me,

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:37.036
the harder I'm gonna hit back

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:41.307
and there's no way he can handle
the dark waters ahead.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.579
♪♪

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:47.613
(Shark)
Quattro doesn't know it,

00:11:47.613 --> 00:11:52.284
but the angrier he makes me,
the harder I'm gonna hit back.

00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.420
You all right?

00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.491
(Quattro)
Shark looks
like his old self.

00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:01.360
Now he's got to feel
like his old self.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.697
You can't get rid of
my Number that easily.

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:06.031
Huh?

00:12:06.532 --> 00:12:07.666
'Cause you see, Quattro,

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:10.336
when Silent Honor Dark
has an Overlay Unit

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:11.036
when it's destroyed,

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.039
it can swim back
on to my field.

00:12:21.013 --> 00:12:25.017
And I regain life points
equal to its attack points.

00:12:34.026 --> 00:12:37.530
Well, I'll make sure it won't
be sticking around for long.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.765
And since it's
run out of Overlay Units,

00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:41.700
it won't be coming back either.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.371
Dark Strings,
attack Silent Honor Dark!

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:47.706
I don't think so.

00:12:47.706 --> 00:12:49.441
Overlay Connection.

00:12:49.441 --> 00:12:53.512
This card becomes Silent
Honor Dark's Overlay Unit.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:57.917
You can't get rid of my
monster that easily.

00:12:59.018 --> 00:13:02.955
Maybe not, but I can still
unleash a beatdown.

00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:11.297
(yelling)

00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:16.735
My Gimmick Puppet
of Dark Strings

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:18.037
lets me draw one card.

00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:20.039
It'll be just
what I need to kick this

00:13:20.272 --> 00:13:22.241
duel up a few notches.

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:27.780
Exactly what I'll do when
I bring my monster back.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.449
Revive, Silent Honor Dark!

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:32.785
Return from oblivion!

00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:41.026
Just as it is reborn,
so are my life points.

00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:47.499
5,300 life points.

00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:50.502
You don't have a chance
against me, Quattro,

00:13:50.502 --> 00:13:52.938
because I am the Barian leader.

00:13:52.938 --> 00:13:54.974
Their combined strength
is mine.

00:13:54.974 --> 00:13:56.976
Haven't you realized by now?

00:13:56.976 --> 00:13:58.744
No matter how hard you
fight for it,

00:13:58.744 --> 00:14:01.880
I will never again be
the Shark you once knew.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.983
No way, I don't believe you.

00:14:03.983 --> 00:14:05.284
You look like the old
Shark again

00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:08.020
and that proves that I am
getting through to you.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:08.754
It must be our dueling

00:14:08.754 --> 00:14:11.523
that's bringing back
the friend I once knew.

00:14:11.523 --> 00:14:12.925
(groaning)

00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:15.861
And you yourself know it too.

00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:17.029
You fool.

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:18.030
Keep dreaming.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.366
Silent Honor Dark
turns your monster

00:14:20.366 --> 00:14:22.468
into its Overlay Unit.

00:14:29.008 --> 00:14:29.742
This is it.

00:14:29.742 --> 00:14:32.711
One more attack
and Quattro is finished!

00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:36.782
I activate Panic Shuffle.

00:14:37.983 --> 00:14:39.885
You might've taken my monster,

00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:41.720
but I'm not out of ideas.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.356
Panic Shuffle switches
Silent Honor Dark

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:45.424
into defense mode

00:14:45.424 --> 00:14:47.660
so you can't
attack me this turn.

00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:49.762
And not only that,

00:14:49.762 --> 00:14:52.598
all the spell and trap cards
in both our graveyards

00:14:52.598 --> 00:14:54.933
get shuffled into our decks.

00:14:57.736 --> 00:14:58.804
You survived this turn.

00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:02.508
But you're only postponing
the inevitable, friend.

00:15:03.342 --> 00:15:06.011
(Shark) Misguided fool.

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:08.280
Now that I am Barian once more,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.617
I never want to feel
human again.

00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:15.320
All I want to feel is rage!

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.992
The rage that destroys
everything!

00:15:20.025 --> 00:15:22.428
Quattro, check out
your foolish friends.

00:15:22.428 --> 00:15:25.030
They actually think they
can defeat us.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:33.372
I won't quit.

00:15:33.372 --> 00:15:35.841
I'm going to
fight to the very end.

00:15:38.343 --> 00:15:40.379
Yuma, hang in there.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:41.246
The gloves are coming off!

00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:44.883
I might be down, but I'm not
even close to being out!

00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:49.021
You might have me up
against the ropes, Alito.

00:15:49.254 --> 00:15:54.493
But I promise, I'm going down
swinging with everything I got!

00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:59.465
You may be able to
crush my monsters,

00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:02.801
but you'll never be able
to crush my spirit.

00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:03.702
Well said, Kaze.

00:16:03.702 --> 00:16:05.304
We will fight
for our friend Yuma

00:16:05.304 --> 00:16:07.806
until our very last point.

00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:10.709
Justice.

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:13.011
Justice can never be defeated.

00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:15.447
And love always conquers all.

00:16:15.447 --> 00:16:17.649
I promised to protect Yuma.

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:20.018
And that's what I'm gonna do.

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:25.257
(Shark)
Your poor friends just
don't know when to give up.

00:16:25.257 --> 00:16:26.992
And we never will.

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:31.730
♪♪

00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:40.038
So how's it going, guys?

00:16:40.038 --> 00:16:43.008
Purr-fect,
now that you're awake!

00:16:43.008 --> 00:16:45.744
So is everyone okay?

00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:48.247
Yep.

00:16:48.247 --> 00:16:51.016
Everybody is absolutely
fantastic.

00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:52.885
That's good.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.290
Why don't we check back in
with your friends, Quattro,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.025
maybe they made a comeback.

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:02.327
Oops, I guess I was wrong.

00:17:02.327 --> 00:17:04.863
They're failing miserably.

00:17:07.866 --> 00:17:09.601
(yelling)

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.608
Farewell.

00:17:16.608 --> 00:17:17.509
Yuma, I'm sorry.

00:17:17.509 --> 00:17:22.014
I wish I was able to have won
this duel like you won my heart.

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:27.286
I guess the good guys don't
always win after all.

00:17:31.857 --> 00:17:35.027
You two guys
deserve a big hand.

00:17:35.027 --> 00:17:39.498
Actually more like
a Giant Red Hand.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.572
I'm done.

00:17:48.674 --> 00:17:52.544
Yuma, forgive your
master for his failure.

00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:54.947
I could not protect you.

00:17:56.014 --> 00:17:59.017
It's been fun,
but it's time to finish this!

00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:02.921
Comet Cestus, knock him
into next week.

00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:09.995
(yelling)

00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:13.031
I can't believe I lost.

00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:16.034
Guess I let my temper
get the best of me.

00:18:16.268 --> 00:18:18.337
Yuma, I'm so sorry.

00:18:18.337 --> 00:18:20.906
I owe you one, kid.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.975
You fought well.

00:18:22.975 --> 00:18:26.778
But unfortunately for you,
not well enough.

00:18:27.346 --> 00:18:28.747
(yelling)

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:32.017
Yuma.

00:18:32.017 --> 00:18:33.585
Not only did I fail you,

00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:35.387
I failed myself.

00:18:37.422 --> 00:18:37.990
I admit, Bronk.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.593
I always found you and the
spirit you bring to dueling...

00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:42.861
oh, what are the words?

00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:45.898
Oh yes, incredibly annoying.

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:48.300
I lost.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.369
I was supposed to
win this duel for

00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:51.503
Yuma and Astral.

00:18:51.503 --> 00:18:53.038
And to bring back Rio.

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:55.841
But I... I let
them all down.

00:18:55.841 --> 00:18:56.608
Know what else?

00:18:56.608 --> 00:19:00.012
Disappointing friends
makes me hungry.

00:19:12.758 --> 00:19:14.493
(Shark) Well, Quattro?

00:19:14.493 --> 00:19:18.964
How does it feel to see your
friends defeated one by one,

00:19:18.964 --> 00:19:22.467
hopelessly crushed under
the destructive might

00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:24.536
of my fellow Barians?

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.038
Quattro.

00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:27.839
Still think you can change me?

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:31.810
Or do you see now just
how wrong you were?

00:19:35.013 --> 00:19:37.683
I see what you've become.

00:19:37.683 --> 00:19:38.817
A Barian!

00:19:38.817 --> 00:19:40.786
The good friend I once knew
is long gone

00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:44.423
and there is nothing I
can do to bring him back.

00:19:44.423 --> 00:19:45.023
(Shark) Excellent.

00:19:45.023 --> 00:19:46.925
Let the passion you
had for saving me

00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:50.028
turn into an unquenchable
desire to defeat me.

00:19:50.028 --> 00:19:52.030
Think about how
your friends were defeated

00:19:52.264 --> 00:19:55.033
and let that fuel your
anger towards me.

00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:56.969
Come at me
with everything you got.

00:19:56.969 --> 00:20:01.306
Let's make this a battle neither
of us will ever forget.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.011
Today I lost an old friend,
but I've gained a new enemy!

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:09.581
Yes, that's correct.

00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:11.883
One who will destroy you!

00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:15.354
It's time, Quattro.

00:20:15.354 --> 00:20:18.290
Time for share
