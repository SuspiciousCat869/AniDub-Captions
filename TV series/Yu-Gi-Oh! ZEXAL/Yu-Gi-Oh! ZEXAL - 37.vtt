WEBVTT

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.360
Nistro: Slam him,
hammer bounzer!

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.690
Take that duelist down!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.230
Get up!

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.890
I'm not finished with you yet!

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.160
Duelist: I'll never cheat
in a duel again nistro!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.430
I learned my lesson.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.830
Please, let me go!

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.060
Not till you pay, punk.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.360
In full.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.530
Dextra: That's enough
nistro, back off.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.590
Don't forget about our real
mission which is to track down

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.490
number cards.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.460
You're getting
off easy this time.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.730
But don't let me see your
face in heartland city!

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.360
Pathetic slime.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.890
Flip: Hey, the tournament!

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.890
Oh man. Last thing I remember
I was checking out the opening

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.590
ceremonies of the duel
carnival with yuma and the gang.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.590
See ya in the finals!

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.390
I wanted to find a
spot where I could hide.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.560
Then I could spy on
the other duelists

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.030
to get an edge in my matches!

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.760
But instead of dueling,
I've just been dozing!

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.430
I'll have to bust a move if I
wanna win all the heart pieces

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.030
I need to make the
finals! Then again,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760
I'm starting really late.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.690
A lot of the weaker duelists
have probably dropped out.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.030
Which means there's more
chance of me losing!

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.530
It's gonna be much Harder
to collect pieces now.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.460
I'll never win this thing.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.360

YUMA: Oh yeah!

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.330
I have four heart
pieces So far!

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.560
TORI: Win one more and
you'll advance to the finals!

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.260
Astral, look!

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.490
What's wrong?

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.890
Astral isn't around.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.060
But isn't he always nearby?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.790
Oh well. It might be a nice
change to have a duel without

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.430
his commentary track.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.990
Astral: These numbers are
fragments of my memories.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.190
And with the help of yuma, I
have been fortunate to regain

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.830
many of them.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.030
Yet I still am
uncertain of so much.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.330
Spencer: Where is that snake?

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.960
He's gotta be hiding someplace!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.360
Spencer!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.890
What are you up to?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.360
I'm lookin' for someone!

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.990
Have you guys seen flip?

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.460
Nope.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.130
He ripped me off.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.260
Hey,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.730
Spencer, I know you're gonna
rule This duel carnival!

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.630
Yep, those other
duelists better watch out!

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.760
Bet you collected loads of those
shiny heart pieces already, huh?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.030
Two.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
But I can't fit
them together yet.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.190
Step this way!

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.430
What do you want?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.030
Feast your eyes!

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.660
You won all of those?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.690
Lemme see your piece.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.860
Hey wait!

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.060
Hey that's mine!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.590
Give it back, flip!

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.230
A perfect fit!

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.690
How would you like to make
a deal, Spencer my friend?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.560
I get to keep your piece and in
exchange you can have all the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.960
pieces you want from this bag.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.730
You switched pieces with flip?

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.230
Uh-huh.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.390
It would've taken forever to
collect all the heart pieces I

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.330
needed if I had to
duel for 'em all.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.890
But later I found out the pieces
I got from him were all phony.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.890
They're made of Candy.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.430
Candy?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.160
I thought it was weird that the
pieces were so sticky. Then they

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.360
melted in my pocket.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.530
Serves you right for trying to
cheat your way into the finals!

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.590
I did deserve it.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.790
But will you please help me get
my pieces back from flip?

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.230
Sure, Spencer.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.790
Boy a: disgusting!

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.730
Boy B: He tricked me!

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.930
Boy C: They're fake!

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.490
Wait till I get my
hands on that flip!

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.460
Stop.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.760
What happened?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.460
This Candy piece Scam
is workin' out sweet for me!

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.330
I already collected four heart
pieces that fit and I only need

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.430
one more to make the finals.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.360
I guess using one piece of Candy
to complete my heart piece

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.960
couldn't hurt.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.990
I'm sure no one
will find out.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.530
We better find flip
before he scams more kids.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.490
Yeah if he gets
enough real pieces.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.330
He'll get into the finals!

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.160
I got my pieces!

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.360
All five of 'em, look!

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.690
Bingo.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.660
My heart Piece is complete!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.290
My, that's impressive!

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.230
It didn't take you very long.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.590
Am I the first duelist
to make the finals then?

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.990
Amazing!

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.090
I'm number one!

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.190
Unless that's made out of Candy.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.390
What?

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.760
I don't understand.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.990
Are you suggesting that this
heart piece could be a fake?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.130
I would never pull
a trick like that, sir!

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.430
Prove it isn't Candy
by tasting it then!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.530
Okay!

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.090
I'll show you it's real!

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.530
This tastes good!

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.460
and it's melting!

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.490
No!

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.560
It's...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.690
Candy!

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.130
Knock it off, kid.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.660
I caught ya!

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.000
I'm innocent!

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.630
Now what do we have here?

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.030
I've been framed!

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.360
I swear, sir!

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.060
Someone Planted those
pieces in my hat!

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.860
Settle down!

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.460
Flip!

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.160
Yuma, help!

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.430
Hold on!

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.190
What are you planning
to do with flip?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.160
What's it to you?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.390
Hey, nistro!

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.830
I recognize him.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.030
That pest has gotten
in our way before.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.730
Oh yeah.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.730
I wanna know what you two
are gonna do with flip!

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.030
This cheat made
fake heart pieces.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.030
He's gonna pay with his deck.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.560
And he'll be banned from
competing in this and all future

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.060
duel carnivals.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.590
Plus I'm kicking him out of
heartland city and he can never

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.790
duel here again!

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.290
Flip was wrong, but
isn't this a little extreme?

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.560
I'll tell you what's extreme.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.060
He violated our sacred
rules of conduct!

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.590
Now he'll suffer
the consequences!

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.360
No!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.630
I'm sorry, honest!

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.890
I'll never break
the rules again!

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.860
Hey, wait a minute!

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.160
I can't deny that flip
made a huge mistake

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.890
and deserves to be punished.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.330
But you can't just
ban him forever!

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.890
How about we settle this
honorably with a duel?

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.330
If I beat you, then you'll agree
to give him a second chance.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.660
You duel me?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.860
Get real.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.830
I'm way better than you.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.290
That's what you think!

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.630
I could beat you
and her together!

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.790
Fine then.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.330
A two-On-One duel.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.190
You'll duel nistro and me
together and if you beat either

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.530
one of us, then
you win the match.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.190
And your friend
gets his second chance.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.130
But if you lose, then you get
the exact same punishment as

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.060
him.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.790
Don't do it, yuma!

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.860
Well, kid?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.190
You still want to duel?

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.890
I knew you'd back down once
the stakes were high enough.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.490
You're all talk!

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.890
Stop right there!

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.060
I'll duel!

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.230
Both of you!

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.730
What?

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.330
You will?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.990
You could lose your deck and be
banned from competing in this or

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.860
future DUEL carnivals!

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.260
Besides, astral
isn't even around.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.990
How can you even think of
taking those two on by yourself?

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.490
It's too tough!

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.030
Look, flip needs my help!

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.560
I can't just turn
my back on him!

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.730
Let's start.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.530
You have no chance but
this could be amusing.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.230
It will be, especially
after I beat both of you!

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.690
Get set to get decked!

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.760
Duel Disk go!

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.260
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.630
Get ready to feel the heat!

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.630
Let's get down to business!

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.660
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.000
Let's duel!

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.490
Let me see if the memories I
do have trigger anything new.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.860
Voice: Your name is astral.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.260
And you're being entrusted
with the future of our world.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.360
No use.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.830
I cannot piece
together more memories.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.560
I need answers.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.360
It seems clear my purpose is
connected with yuma in ways I

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.490
still cannot fully grasp.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.190
There is a bond between us so
strong it can generate a great

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.230
transformation But will
it also bring destruction?

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.230
Yuma!

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.330
He has begun a duel.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.690
I must go.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.330
Number 96: Leaving
so soon, astral?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.130
You again!

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.660
Number 96!

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.490
How is it you are here?

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.190
Did you break
your Seal again?

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.530
Correct.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.930
We all decided it
was time to act.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.960
You all?

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.660
We should end this
duel quickly, nistro.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.790
No problem.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.760
Astral isn't here?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.490
Well then this
match is over!

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.760
Come on.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.290
Yuma can't beat
those guys by himself.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.990
You better start
cheering for yuma

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.490
or you'll have
to deal with me!

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.890
You can beat 'em both, yum

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.630
don't worry, flip.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.160
I have the perfect
cards and strategy.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.460
You'll see. It's my move!

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.430
First I'm playing a monster
facedown in defense mode.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.360
Then I'll play
another facedown,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.460
and end my turn.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.830
For someone who talks big,
it sure looks like you

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.560
don't have the
cards to back it up!

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.730
You wish.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.560
I'm just getting ready to
pounce when the time is right.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.290
Does this mean that
the other numbers

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.930
are giving you their power?

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.430
Naturally.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.730
We all agree that
our time has come.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.790
It is time to act
and to destroy!

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.030
Destroy?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.790
Are you saying that
we exist in order

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.890
to bring destruction
to the world?

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.330
What other purpose
could you and I have?

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.930
I'll go next.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.460
I draw!

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.090
And summon
morpho butterspy!

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.360
And with this,
I'll end my turn.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.860
You're up, nistro!

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.760
That's one strong butterfly!

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.260
If you think that's strong,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.230
just wait until you see what
I have in store for you.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.390
You ready?

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.930
I draw!

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.760
I summon hammer bounzer!

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.260
I can summon this card when you

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.490
have cards on your
field but I don't.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.830
My bouncer is a real beast!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.930
Look at all those
attack points!

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.330
He's not foolin' around.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.130
That monster's
level six!

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.090
I'll turn it
over to you, yuma.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.030
Let's see if you have
the guts to strike!

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.660
I have to think this through
carefully before I decide which

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.060
monster to go after first,
and which of my cards to use.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.390
That's it!

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.690
I know my next move!

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.130
I draw!

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.990
And I'm gonna change my facedown
Monster from defense mode

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.260
to attack mode!

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Rev it up, rai Rider!

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.160
1200 attack points.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.090
If that's your best monster,
this duel will be over quick.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.390
Don't be too sure!

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.860
Next I'm gonna
summon Tasuke Knight!

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.030
First, I'll knock out that
morpho butterspy with tasuke

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.230
Knight, then rai Rider can
attack to score some major

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.860
damage!

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.230
Okay, tasuke Knight!

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.890
Attack with
power-push!

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.860
I activate the
trap butterflyoke!

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.260
And with it,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
I'm putting the brakes on
your tasuke Knight's attack!

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.990
Because When butterflyoke trap
equips on to your monster, it

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.760
switches it from attack
to defense mode!

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.030
She foiled his attack
before it even hit!

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.730
It seems you're
right back where

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.360
you were before your
turn began, genius.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.260
Just wait until
my next turn.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.860
Yuma's a total
mess without

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.560
astral around to
help him battle!

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.890
Where is he?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.530
Send out an astral alarm!

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.660
Your destiny lies with us.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.530
Remember your mission!

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.460
The time has come at last.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.960
Come and join us... astral!

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.260
What?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.060
Utopia!

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.430
Number 39, you refuse to join us
on our mission of destruction?

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.490
Well then, I will have to
have you join us by force!

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.160
Subdue utopia, dark mist!

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.660
I summon swallowtail
butterspy in attack mode!

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.990
Then I'll use my
butterflyoke

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.890
Trap card again and spring
its second effect!

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.330
Once each turn, this trap card
lets me change the battle mode

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.390
of the equipped monster.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.730
So I'm switching your
tasuke Knight to attack mode!

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.230
It's obvious that your planning
to attack tasuke Knight with

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.590
your swallowtail.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.190
But there's hardly any
difference in attack points,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.160
so I'll just take
a little damage!

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.390
You're right.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.690
So I'll have to activate
morpho's special ability!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.060
If your monster changes battle
mode, once a turn morpho wipes

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.090
out a thousand of
it's attack points!

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.360
Oh man!

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.530
Your Knight's totally
vulnerable now!

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.960
Morpho butterspy,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.660
take out your tasuke Knight
with Blue Scale stream!

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.560
And I'm also triggering
swallowtail's special ability!

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.630
Now one of your monsters loses
attack points equal to the

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:39.960
amount of damage you just took!

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.130
Call a mechanic, 'cause
that biker reaking down!

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.490
Get set swallowtail,
attack rai Rider!

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.000
Vivid Scale stream!

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.560
Yuma!

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.230
We're gonna get
tossed if he loses.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.990
Guess I better start
Packing my suitcase!

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.430
You're running out of
life points fast yuma,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.060
and you still haven't
scored a single hit

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.760
against my partner and me.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.330
Give it up.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.830
No way.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.990
I was just warming up and the
real duel is only beginning now!

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.660
And I've got some
surprises for ya!

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.060
Really?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.260
I'm gonna use rai
Rider's special ability!

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.190
Since your monster
attacked this card,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.660
it can't battle
on your next turn.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660
What difference does it make?

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.230
Your field is empty anyway.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.130
That special ability
is useless right now.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.960
He can't last
much longer, nistro.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.760
Finish him.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.060
Take hold of utopia!

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.330
It's my turn!

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.330
I summon blade bounzer!

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.190
Then hammer bounzer's going
to attack you directly!

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.690
And don't think you can
protect yourself either!

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.230
When there are no spell
or trap cards on my field

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.660
and this card attacks,
you can't activate any

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.760
spells or traps!

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.390
You're totally at
my mercy now yuma,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.390
and I'm not in a forgiving mood.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.660
Attack him, hammer bounzer,
knuckle knockdown!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.860
Yuma!

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.230
He's almost done for!

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.730
That loser is out
of his league.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.930
One last attack from blade
bounzer and this duel is over.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.490
He should've taken more damage!

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.330
Yuma's monster protected him!

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.760
That's right 'cuz when I'm
attacked directly, I can summon

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.490
Gagaga gardna from my

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.460
hand To help shield me.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:07.260
And by discarding one card,
it won't be destroyed!

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.760
But you still take damage
if my monster is stronger!

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.960
Your gardna has
1500 attack points.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.630
My blade Bounzer has 1800!

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.160
Blade bounzer, strike!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.860
Use your straight slash!

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.190
I'm discarding one card and
activating gagaga gardna's

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.060
special ability again!

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.290
Yuma!

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.660
He lost another three
Hundred life points!

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.090
Yeah But I can keep
fighting on.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.930
And so can my
gagaga gardna!

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.460
Oh no it can't.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.290
Check out my blade
Bounzer's special ability!

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.390
By discarding a card
from my hand,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.190
blade bounzer can clobber
your monster all over again!

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.860
Not cool!

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.660
Gardna is a goner!

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.230
Nistro has four more cards left

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.960
after this so he
can keep on attacking!

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.760
Once again, blade bounzer!

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.890
Attack Gagaga gardna!

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.960
Straight slash!

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.290
Don't worry gardna!

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.030
I'm discarding a card, so that

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.290
bounzer of his can't
hurt you in any way!

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.460
Yuma!

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.490
You just played
your last card, kid.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:28.460
Now gagaga gardna can't use
it's special ability again.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.990
It was a total rout.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.630
You choked and now you're
out of the carnival!

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.330
Strike again, bounzer!

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.490
Let's end this duel now!

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.860
Straight Slash attack!

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.160
Gagaga gardna!

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.000
Noooo!
