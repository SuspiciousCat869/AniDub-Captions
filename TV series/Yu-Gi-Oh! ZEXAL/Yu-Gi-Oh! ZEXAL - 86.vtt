WEBVTT

00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:04.538
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal"...

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.206
You will
duel me,

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:06.740
won't
you?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.075
Hold up!

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.043
If I accept, I'm gonna
have to put my Numbers

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.011
on the
line, right?

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.279
Of course.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.548
But Yuma, we'll both
be dueling for Numbers

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.650
and for our
very survival.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.418
Survival?

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.422
I activate a
Barian Sphere Field!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.894
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:30.297
I overlay both my
Level 4 Battlin' Boxers!

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.233
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.604
and Xyz Summon
Battlin' Boxer Lead Yoke!

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.940
I'll turn it over
to you now, Yuma.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.109
It's now or
never, Utopia!

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.077
Give it all
you've got!

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.814
Strike Lead Yoke with
Rising Sun Double Flare Slash!

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.916
(roar)

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.117
(explosion)

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:54.187
(shouting)

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:03.263
(Astral)
This Barian Sphere Field is
starting to drain my powers...

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:07.267
just at the moment Yuma
will most need my help!

(Yuma)
This duel
is awesome!

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.234
Hope you're
ready for round two

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.170
'cause it's gonna
get even more extreme.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.672
Bring
it on!

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:21.341
We can take anything
you throw at us!

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.244
Those two
are so alike.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.145
Yeah.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.713
They're both
out of control.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:30.250
Yuma, be
careful!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.754
And away
we go!

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:37.758
For starters, I summon
Battlin' Boxer SwitchHitter!

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.530
And I'll immediately follow
that up with the spell card

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.867
Battlin'
Boxing Spirits!

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.869
Now I have to send
the top card in my deck

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.203
to the
graveyard.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.039
But here's the
fun part, Yuma.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.573
If it's a
Battlin' Boxer,

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.542
then I can summon a
different Battlin' Boxer

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.512
from my
graveyard.

00:02:58.512 --> 00:02:59.780
(Alito)
Great!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.981
Guess
what, Yuma.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.650
I just drew Battlin'
Boxer Counterpunch!

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.318
I'll send it
straight to the graveyard

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.455
so I can summon
the champ himself,

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.759
Battlin' Boxer
Headgeared!

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.960
All right
SwitchHitter,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.996
time to use your
special ability!

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:20.400
When I use it to Xyz Summon,
it counts as two monsters!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.768
Something
big is coming!

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.969
I know!

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.772
I've been taking it
far too easy on you!

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.374
Not anymore,
though!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.608
Especially
now that I have

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.411
three Battlin'
Boxers to overlay!

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:37.184
Just
watch this!

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:40.921
With these three monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.089
Feelin'
nervous yet...

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.257
'Cause you
should be!

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.394
I Xyz Summon
Number 105:

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:51.398
Battlin' Boxer
Star Cestus!

00:03:54.601 --> 00:04:00.474
(growling)

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.109
That Number
is over 100!

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.578
Such Numbers
should not even exist!

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.645
But
they do!

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.081
And we have to find
a way to stop this one!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.584
Star Cestus take
out Yuma's Number!

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.719
Demolish
his Utopia!

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.188
But Utopia's
way too strong!

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.357
Your Number
doesn't stand a chance.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.658
I don't really
care, Yuma,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.727
'cause I'm goin'
for broke anyway!

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:24.731
Star Cestus, attack
with Stardust Impact!

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.469
Alito would not try
this unless he had

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.438
some other
surprise in store.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.773
Yeah,
I know.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.175
But just in case,
I'll use an Overlay Unit

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.810
to deflect
the attack!

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.213
Go Light
Wing Shield!

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.748
That won't
stop me!

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:45.852
I use an Overlay Unit to
activate my Numbers ability!

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.055
When Star Cestus has fewer
attack points than Utopia,

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.158
it can't be
destroyed in battle,

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.927
and this battle can
no longer be stopped!

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:54.995
Oh, yeah.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:57.097
I forget to mention
you take all the damage

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:58.465
that should
go to me!

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.900
I take it?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.503
I suggest you brace yourself,
Yuma, for a very big impact!

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.238
2,500
points?

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.473
That's
right!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.876
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it!

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.981
(roaring)

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.685
(Yuma)
Utopia,
watch out!

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.687
(shouting)

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:26.927
♪

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.095
With that, I put
one card facedown

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.664
and turn it
over to you!

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.899
I really don't like
how this is going!

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.502
Alito's move caught
him by surprise.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.104
He better turn things
around quick or else.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.739
That Barian's
relentless!

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.074
Having fun?

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:45.378
Or are my superior skills
spoiling the duel for you?

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:48.148
I'm gonna sweep this
sphere with you and your deck!

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:50.684
I believe the time
for having fun is over.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.153
We are in
great danger!

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:54.221
I know!

00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.555
If we lose
to Alito,

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.524
it could be our
last duel ever!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.159
But I also know
there's something different

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.360
about
this duel,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.696
something I
never experienced!

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.999
You and I have competed against
all kinds of duelists before.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.934
We always battled
hard to gather Numbers

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.570
and to keep our opponents
from winning our Numbers.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.938
But when I
duel Alito,

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.407
it becomes about
more than winning!

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.109
I wanna
high-five the sky

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.579
and I can sense that
Alito wants the same thing!

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.781
I see,
Yuma.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:24.017
There is much at stake,
but you must stay true

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:26.519
to what your heart
is telling you.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.922
I too will
try to have fun.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:32.926
Let us
high-five the sky!

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:36.062
I draw!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.397
You wanna
test your skills?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.667
Try beating Astral and
me when we merge our might!

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:41.768
Are you
ready, Yuma?

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:42.836
Yeah!

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:46.072
(both)
Time to
feel the flow!

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.507
Astral!

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:53.513

Zexal is revealed!

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.868

That's the most incredible
thing I've ever witnessed!

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.010
I can sense this duel is
about to get even more intense!

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.212
Looks to me like
Yuma and Astral

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:28.648
may still have
a fighting chance.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.583

For every Xyz Monster on
the field, I can draw one card!

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.594
Since I have Utopia
and you have Star Cestus,

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:44.564

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:12.125
But
it's weaker!

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.494
Why did Yuma and
Astral summon Utopia Ray

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.397
if they were gonna
lose 2,500 attack points?

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:18.431
Relax.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.066
They know what
they're doing.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.469
Star Cestus can only
use its special ability

has more attack points,

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.840

now evenly matched.

Are you all
set, Astral?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.411
We will strike Star
Cestus with all our might!

That's right.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.147
With the power
of this card

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:09.015
I can revive
my Utopia Ray

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.818

Star Cestus!

That's
so cool!

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:38.144
I guess it's true that
great minds think alike,

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.246
'cause I did the
exact same thing!

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.183

I activated Xyz Stand,

He had the same
strategy as us!

And since I used Xyz
Stand to summon Utopia Ray,

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.906
it's not
allowed to attack.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.908
I'll have to
end my turn.

I'm totally feeling the flow!

Not if I activate Eagle

It stops
your trap card

destroy your Comet Cestus!

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:58.217
I expected
that move!

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.586
And I can counter
it all too easily

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.889
with my trap
Corkscrew Counter!

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:06.225
Not only does it negate
Eagle Claw's special ability,

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:10.997
but it also inflicts you
with 500 points of damage!

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.164
500?

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:14.200
I only have 200
life points left!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.568
They're
finished!

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:16.969

No,

You're

I'm activating a
trap card, Last Chance!

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.486
You activated a trap
from my graveyard before

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.055
and now I'm gonna
return the favor!

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.357
You are activating
one of my traps?

That's
right!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.193
I choose
Counter Clash!

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:44.297
It negates and destroys a
trap activated during battle.

Destroying your
Corkscrew Counter!
