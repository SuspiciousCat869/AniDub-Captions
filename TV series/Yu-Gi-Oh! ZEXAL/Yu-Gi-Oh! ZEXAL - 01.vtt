a sentence has a
noun and a predicate

gotta take chances.

That they found on one of their
expeditions?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.790

I mean, yeah, sure

I've lost twenty straight,
so what?

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.590
Yuma look.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.090
It's bronk.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.160
it's shark.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.130
Shark: I've got you now bronk.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.430
See, since I've got two
monsters on the field

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.190
and they both have
the same level

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.630
I can use them to
summon an xyz monster.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.930
So watch as I overlay
my skull kraken and

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.430
big jaws to do just that.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.390
Watch as I unleash a terror of
both land and sea.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.930
Watch

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.360
as I summon

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.190
aero shark!

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.530

Wow.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.560
Ya know why an xyz
summon is so cool, Tori?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360
Cuz the monsters used stick
around as overlay units

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.030
and help activate their new
Buddy's special powers.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.930
It's all about teamwork.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.790
I betcha those litter bots
wouldn't call my cards trash.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.230
If I had an xyz monster.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.530
Now, aero shark.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.690
Dig in on that chump.

and for this.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.830
Bronk's deck?

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.890
Not so fast!

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.930
Who are you?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.460

Or don't ya know who you're
messing with?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.490
Sure, I know him.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.190
Everyone knows the school bully.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.930
I'm no bully

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.330
you see bronk and I

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.660
we had an arrangement.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.730
What?

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.990
It went like this

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.330
whoever won got the
other's duel deck.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.530
Is that True?

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.030
It is

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.390
but I had to do it.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.690

to being in the same
league as shark!

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.030
Nah, you're not even
in the same sport!

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.860
So is that a no?

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.090
I guess that means you're
just a big chicken!

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.090
Chicken?

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.130
You know what happened
to the last person

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.760
that called me chicken?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.490
Something, uh, bad?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.090
I don't know because it's
never ever happened before!

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.260
Oh, well then let
this be the first.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.960
Big talk.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.130
Alright, yuma,
say that we did duel.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.260
You want bronk's deck back but
what's in it for me?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.660
Good question

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.390
hadn't thought of that

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.060
hey, that's mine!

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.230
My, this certainly
seems important

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.690
to you, now doesn't it?

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.160
Give it!

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.460
Settle down, since it means that
much to you, I'll give it back

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.430
and duel you for it...whoops.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.690
I dropped it.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.160
Hope nothing bad happens
to it down there,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.360
say, like this.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.730
[gasp]

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.290
uh!

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.360
Why did you do that?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.730
The same reason I'm doing this.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.560
Guess you're right after all

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.990
I am a bully!

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.630
And since we can't duel for that
anymore, you don't get this.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.530
-that's it, you're toast.
-Stop it!

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.530
You don't give up, do ya?

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.390
Alright, if you still
wanna duel me,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.390
I guess we can figure some sort
of arrangement out.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.260
If you beat me, I'll give back
this deck.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.660
But, if I win yuma

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.960
I get your deck.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.990
This Sunday.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.560
At the station courtyard.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.330
If you want bronk's
cards back be there.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.830
Whoever can open This door will
gain a great new power.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.460
But know, that with such a
reward comes great risk.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.060
Have you the courage to unlock
this power?

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.030
I don't even know if I have the
key to unlock it anymore.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.860
Hey yuma

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.860
you gonna try and leap those
twenty blocks again?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.990
Not today.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.230
Yuma, wanna try that
underwater lap again?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.530
Not really.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.190
Hey, what's wrong
with you today?

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.190
I dunno, Tori.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.790
I guess that I'm just not
feeling the flow.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.860
Ever since shark broke my key

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.290
things just haven't
been the same.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.690
Yeah.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.190
Yuma

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.190
what's up?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.330
Yuma...This duel with shark.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.830
Are you doing it?

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.330
Well, uh

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.160
don't go.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.690
You can't win, yuma.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.090
What do you mean by that?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.560
I mean shark made it all the way
to the duel nationals last year.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.530
Look

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.530
thanks for trying an all.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.990
But I'm over this, really.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.730
But it's not just about you now.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.190
It's about doing what's right.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.890
Shark's gotta learn he can't
push people around like this.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.530
And I'm gonna be the
one to teach him.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.430
So what if he made
it to the nationals.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.730
One day, I'm gonna
make it there too!

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.760
Uh, whatever.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.230
Here.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.230
Whoa

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.730
how did you find this?

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.890
Duh

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.390
I went lookin' for it.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.730
Later!

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.790
Maybe those litter bots were
right and my cards are trash.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.460
No, this was my dad's deck

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.860
and I know he gave it
to me for a reason.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.090
Bye grandma.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.590
Wait.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.060
Oh right, your kiss.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.190
No.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.230
What's this?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.460
Duel fuel.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.030
Now go take down that bully.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.090
I can't believe it.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.630
You actually showed.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.630
Hope you said your goodbyes.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.160
Cuz all of your cards
are about to be mine.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.630
Sorry, But the only thing that
you're gonna be getting.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.090
Is a good old fashioned
Butt-Kickin'.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.930
and why's that?

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.090
Cuz I'm feelin'...the flow!

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.560
Duel Disk go!

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.160
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.790
Duel interface set.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.230
Computer voice: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.030
Let's duel!

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.830
Yay, yuma.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.330
Win this.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.030
Get set to get decked.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.990
I summon zubaba Knight.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.190
You're going down, shark!

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.200
Zubaba KNIGHT: Zubaba Knight!

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.160
I summon zubaba KNIGHT

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.130
zubaba Knight

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.730
of course, since I went first...

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.960
I'm not allowed to
attack this turn.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.630
So go ahead, your move.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.460
Got that right and with it, I
intend to crown that Knight.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.790
It's my draw!

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.190
I summon forth big jaws.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.960
[roaring]

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.090
man, 1800 attack points.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.930
That's right and since zubaba
Knight has just 1600.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.030
You're in deep water.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.130
After all, when
two monsters fight

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.390
the one with the least attack
points is destroyed and

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.860
its owner takes the
difference as damage.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.390
Aw great, so that means I'm
losing 200 life points!

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.530
Next time, play your weak
monster in defense mode.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.030
Although,it really wouldn't have
mattered this time.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.030
Cuz of this.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.260
The spell card aqua jet.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.060
Now until the end of this turn

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.660
my big jaws gains
1000 attack points.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.860
There it is.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.260
Yep, shark's super spell combo!

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.060
Now, big jaws, it's...

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.560
feeding time.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.360
Attack.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.290
[roaring]

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.860
zubaba Bash!

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.760
Ah, my life points.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.990
Next I'll place a facedown card

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.290
and end my turn.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.560
Nuts...

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.560
we just started and I'm already
down in a big way.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.230
I gotta even the score.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.860
I summon out...gagaga magician.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.160
[lightning]

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.130
you're summoning
him in attack mode?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.560
With just 1500 attack points?

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.290
You just don't listen

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.630
do ya?

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.130
Oh, I sure do

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.360
that's why I'm
equipping gagaga with This

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.160
wonder wand!

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.090
Now my magician Gains
500 attack points.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.530
You said Play Weak
monsters in defense mode

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.590
Well, he's no
weak monster.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.760
Hey alright.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.560
Now gagaga is stronger
than big jaws.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.160
Now go mighty magician.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.190
Reel in that fish.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.590
How about you try and get real.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.890
I play my facedown!

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.560
Your facedown?

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.090
That's right, zeus' breath!

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.430
And I have a feeling it's going
to stink for you

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.960
because thanks to this trap

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.830
I can put a stop to your
monster's attack.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.660
Ahh!

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.790
And there's more

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.930
if I have a water
monster on my field

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.560
you also take
800 points of damage.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.560
And there is a water
monster on my field...

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.590
so prepare to be soaked

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.830
with a serious splash of damage!

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.060
Ahh!

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.460
Oh boy, wait, I got it!

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.030
Yeah!

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.560
If you can play trap cards,
so can I!

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.790
So that's what I'll do.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.260
Yuma!

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
You can play two types of
facedown's, spells and traps!

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.390
Never say which it is!

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.160
Oohh, get it together!

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.560
Trap card, huh?

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.130
Big deal, it's my draw.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.430
And first, I summon skull
kraken!

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.830
[Explosion]

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.430
600 attack points?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.190
Alright, no prob.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.360
Gagaga magician is still the
strongest monster on the field.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.760
Not for long he's not

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.830
I activate skull kraken's
special ability.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.390
With it, I can destroy one
face-Up spell or

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.760
trap card on your field, such as
that wonder wand, for example.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.190
-Oh no!
-Oh yes.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.730
Now gagaga magician is back at
the bottom of the food chain.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.730
Not good.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.990
Why?

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.830
Shark's got two
monsters out now!

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.330
The same ones he had right
before he beat me.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.660
He must be planning
an xyz summon.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.760
And if he gets it off.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.160
There's no way yuma
will win this.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.590
Yuma...

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.730
you fool!

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.530
Did you really think
you could beat me.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.360
The best of the best, and win
bronk's deck back?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.130
Yeah, I kinda did.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.530
Guess I was wrong.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.160
I thought I was feelin' the
flow, but maybe not.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.030
Face it, yuma.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.490
I stomped your
little key to pieces

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.850
and now I'm gonna stomp you.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.230
That's right, yuma

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.760
this duel is over

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.030
and when I win your duel deck

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.930
I'm gonna trash it just like I
trashed your key.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.360
Then maybe you'll learn your

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.460
lesson, don't pick fights you
can't win.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.330
That's where you're wrong, shark

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.290
I'll never learn that lesson.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.890
No matter how many times I fall

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.130
no matter how many times I get
laughed at

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.430
I'll keep trying to high five
the sky 'cause when

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.390
you're feeling the flow, there's
no going back.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.130
And speaking of feelin'
the flow

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.090
I...so...am!

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.990
My key...

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.490
whoa, it's my dream.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.260
This is no dream.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.390
Have you the courage to unlock
this power?

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.290
It is time to decide, yuma.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.890
Female voice: Have you the
courage?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.130
-What will it be?
-He has the courage.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.230
Ahh!

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.630
Alright!

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.490
Let's flow!

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.260
Whao, ahhh!

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.790
What was that,
and what's all this?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.290
Whoa, that was weird.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.830
Hey

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.290
my key...

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.960
it's totally fixed!

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.990
Huh!

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.960
Yes, and you are in a fix!

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.060
Ahh!

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.690
NUMBER: Yes, shark.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.990
Jj let the number take hold

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.430
ahh!

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.390
I overlay level 3...

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.060
big jaws and kraken!

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.560
Now, I can build
the overlay network!

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.960
Now, number 17,
leviathan Dragon!

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.960
Be born!

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:48.430
[♪...]

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.290
what is that?

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.660
I've never seen this monster
before in my life.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.760
Yeah

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.290
same here.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.930
And what's with the
whole number thing?

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.930
[roaring]

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.430
now by removing one of my
overlay units

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.830
like my skull kraken

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.290
I can power up leviathan Dragon
by 500 attack points.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.660
What?

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.960
Leviathan Dragon attack with
Shock Stream blast!

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.830
[Roaring]

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.060
[YELLING]

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.560
yuma!

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.030
This duel's just about done.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.430
One more attack and you're
through.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.390
Ahh, that's some Dragon.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.290
So much for a comeback.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.390
Astral: Rise

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.530
Rise up!

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.590
Who, who are you?
