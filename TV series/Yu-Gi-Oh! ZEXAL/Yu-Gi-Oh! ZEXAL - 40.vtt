WEBVTT

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.830
Mr. Heartland: Greetings,
magnificent duelists!

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.330
The sun has set on the second
day of the world duel carnival!

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.230
Tomorrow, the battle
for heart pieces continues!

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.130
For now brave duelists, rest
your decks and gather your

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.060
strength because come tomorrow,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.860
you're gonna need it!

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.030
Orbital 7: Master Kite, I know
you need to find more numbers,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.690
but you've been in photon
mode for far too long.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.130
I have to warn you that
if you keep this up,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.590
your body could...

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.160
Kite: Your concern is noted.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.130
Now get back to tracking
down info on the numbers.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.390
Sorry!

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.190
Tracking info!

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.660
Hart...

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.730
how you feelin'?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.230
HART: Brother...

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.530
I've gathered more numbers.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.290
Before you know it, you're
gonna feel a lot better.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.960
I just need you to
keep hanging in there.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.360
You think you can
do that for me?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.590
Brother...

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.830
brother...

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.090
heh!

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.260
I just tripped.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.930
What a klutz.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.090
Brother...

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.560
I must go.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.960
Security guard A: Whoa!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260

TORI: Thanks for buying me
all this Candy and stuff.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.260
How come you didn't get
anything for yourself?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.560
Yuma: I thought you were
gonna share with me.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.660
Didn't realize
you'd hog it all.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.430
What are you muttering?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.960
Uh, nothing!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.260
CROWD: There is a
kid in the street!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.490
He's gonna get hurt out there!

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.760
You seeing this?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.830
What is that kid doing?

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.230
I know that kid.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.430
It's Kite's little brother.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.260
Yuma!

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.590
Hey!

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.630
What are you doin'
playin in traffic?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.790
PEOPLE: Look out!

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.930
Yuma...

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.530
yuma!

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.390
Wha... how did...

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.860
ASTRAL: Yuma, look.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.690
There's a hole in the truck!

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.690
But...

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.730
what...

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.930
where did that come from?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.330
Astral, did you see
what just happened?

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.830
I did.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.360
At the moment of the collision,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.990
some sort of power
phenomenon occurred.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.890
It seemed to protect
you and the boy.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.060
Could this power
have come from him?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.060
You look like you're cold.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.730
Huh?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.490
Is he talking to you?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.530
Are you saying you can see me?

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.190
Yes, I can.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.230
Who are you?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.960
This is freaking me out.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.830
Is he one of
you or something?

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.430
My name is astral.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.560
I know that name.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.930
Astral.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.130
Do you know something about me?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.930
Yuma!

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.230
You're okay!

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.590
Yeah, but...

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.760
uh, I don't think
we should stick around.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.430
Bring the boy!

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.660
I need to ask
him more questions.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.490
After what he did to the truck?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.690
I have a feeling
I'm gonna regret this!

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.060
Probably!

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.160
DRIVER: Hey, look what
you did to my truck!

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.990
NISTRO: So what do
we think caused this?

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.390
Meteor? Big monster maybe?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.390
Dextra: You know perfectly
well it was subject zero.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.430
If Mr. Heartland Finds
out that he's out there...

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.430
Yeah Well, he won't.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.060
And neither will Kite.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.490
We'll have the
kid home by morning.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.190
Hopefully he can manage to keep

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.360
a lid on himself
until we track him down.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.390
Let's move out nistro.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.390
Tv ANNOUNCER: We now go to
east city C, block 3562,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.430
where traffic is at a
standstill after an earlier

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.560
incident in which a
trailer spun out of control

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.160
and fell on its side.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.630
Witnesses on the scene report
seeing a 'strange light.'

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.690
woooah!

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.860
It's on the news!

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.260
You see the hole
in my rig, right?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.760
I mean I don't
know what happened.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.730
Some Witnesses claim that
moments before the incident...

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.690
bringing him to my house
was not a good idea.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.930
Lillybot: Yuma, be quiet.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.660
Yuma, be quiet.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.790
I need to ask
you something, Hart.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.390
How is it you can see me?

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.530
Why wouldn't I
be able to see you?

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.390
Hey!

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.990
It's almost ready.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.130
Kari: Get over here and
set the table, doofus!

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.790
Woooahhh, Fried dumplings,
soup, fish, meat, potatoes!

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.490
Think I'll start with these!

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.060
We haven't all sat down yet.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.330
I was gonna Wait,
I was just looking!

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.930
You were gonna hog all the
best dumplings for yourself.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.760
Grandma: Don't be
shy, help yourself.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.430
Hear that, grandma, Kari just
said some of your dumplings

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.630
don't look good!

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.590
Did not!

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.060
Heh,heh,heh!

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.890
Tori, be a dear
and pass the potatoes.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.190
Here ya' go.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.460
This soup is really great.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.430
What are the spices in here?

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.160
It's an ancient
secret family recipe!

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.330
Hey, how come you're
not eating anything?

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.430
Don't you wanna Chow down?

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.530
There's no reason to
hold back, just dive on in.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.160
Hurry before yuma
steals it all.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.790
Heeyyy!

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.830
I saw you eyeing
his potatoes.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.460
And you've already
had, like, five dumplings.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.190
Hart.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.460
What? I've only had two!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.560
Grandma, how many
dumplings did you make?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.730
Twelve!

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.030
Let's see.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.290
I've had one, Hart's
got one on his plate,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.490
I've only had two so far.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.390
Yeeeah, there you go!

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.590
You know what's
really awesome?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.130
Try dipping the dumplings
in your bowl of soup!

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.190
Now Hart,
ask for more.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.160
May I have some more please?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.230
Pilot a: We'll scan
the western district.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.630
Copy that.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.290
If you see the kid, do
not try to apprehend him.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.360
Unless you wanna be obliterated
by an otherworldly power.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.060
So where do you
think he was heading?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.530
I have no idea. I guess we
should get him back to Kite so

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.260
we'll have to track
him down somehow.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.360
Yeah but... you know what's
gonna happen if you see Kite.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.330
There's gonna be trash
talk and then a duel and...

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.630
and if you lose, then...

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.930
How about we worry about
that part when we get to it.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.460
Yuma...

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.690
Hart can see me.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.930
There is something
quite special about him.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.360
I have a feeling he knows
about me and where I am from.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.430
Brother...

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.030
brother!

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.990
Look, tomorrow, we'll sit
him down and ask him...

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.260
the window!

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.360
C'mon, we gotta go!

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.560
Hey, Hart!

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.630
Where are you?

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.260
Come back!

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.190
Brother... I will help you.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.260
Hart!

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.890
Gaah! Man, he coulda
gone anywhere!

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.630
What if something happens
again like before?

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.230
Good thinking!

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.730
This way!

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.730
Astral!

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.730
Wait!

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.090
Did you see that?

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.830
The little boy in the road
wrecked all those cars!

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.190
Man A: How am I
supposed to explain

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.830
this to my insurance company?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.430
Woman a: Yeah,
good luck with that.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.290
This looks like Hart's doing.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.430
I can sense the energy.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.160
He's gotta be around here.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.290
There he is!

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.030
Up on the overpass!

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.130
C'mon, we gotta hurry!

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.330
Hart!

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.030
Hold on!

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.560
What do you think you're doing
wandering around out here?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.990
I have to go.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.230
Okay, go where?

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.760
to that place.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.560
My brother needs my help.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.990
Your brother.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.660
Okay, you're looking for Kite.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.130
Great, well then, tomorrow
morning, we'll wake up,

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.560
Chow down on some
breakfast, and then

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.890
find your brother.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.260
Sound good?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.660
Tonight, we'll just
go back to uuuhh...

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.860
get back!

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.260
Tori, get away from him!

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.890
Hart, wait up.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.090
Alright!

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.460
Gotcha!

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.460
Turn This bird around and
head to the b12 district.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.730
Are you sure it's the kid?

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.890
Sure am!

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.430
Unless They're makin' cars
that run on dark energy.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.890
That's his fourth
power surge tonight.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.490
Little guy's on a roll.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.190
Brother...

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.690
So, what?

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.060
You think he's trying
to get to wherever Kite is?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.990
Yeah, that's what
my gut's sayin'.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.130
Who is that?

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.230
Stay where you are!

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.760
C'mon Hart, you're
out past your bedtime.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.030
You again?

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.130
That's right! What
do you want with Hart?

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.130
This has nothing
to do with you.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.260
The less you kids
know the better.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.690
He keeps talking
about his brother Kite.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.990
He tends to do that
from time to time.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.690
Now run along home and
forget you were ever here.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.360
Where are you taking him?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.830
How do you even know him?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.960
You ask too many questions.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.090
C'mon, kid.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.630
Hang on...

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.060
you can't take him!

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.760
I don't think he
wants to go with you.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.390
He doesn't have a choice!

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.290
The only safe place for him
to be is heartland city!

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.290
Heartland Will
be your new home.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.160
You'll like it there.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
No, not again!

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.790
You need to leave me alone.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.290
Uh-Oh.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.530
Dark energy is
building up very fast.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.560
Get away, nistro!

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.990
Dextra!

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.460
Talk to me. You okay?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.430
I'm fine.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.830
But subject zero
is on the move.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.530
C'mon, Hart.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.530
I'm not gonna let
that guy take you away.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.290
We'll get you to your brother!

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.390
Birdie one to all
units, listen up!

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.460
Subject is still at large!

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.230
And be careful, he's
more dangerous than ever.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.230
Brother...

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.560
I guess this is it.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.030
Kite must be up there.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.430
Yuma,

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.660
are you ready for
what might happen?

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.490
No one's up here.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.830
Hey Hart, what's goin' on?

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.990
Where?

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.190
Where is it?

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.730
It's supposed to be up here!

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.390
What is, Hart?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.030
I have to find it.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.460
Chill out for a sec.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.090
Just talk to us.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.930
Tell us what
you're looking for.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.660
It's a square.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.290
It's small and very sweet.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.730
Okayyy...

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.130
without it, my
brother will be...

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.560
Hart!

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.460
This light.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.490
It seems like it's different
than all the other times!

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.290
It is!

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.030
I recognize this energy.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.260
Astral!

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.830
C'mon!

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.760
You move, when I move.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.130
Now, quick!

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.860
Looks Like they
called off the search.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.390
We're safe for now.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.690
Listen, I am not going
to let them hurt you, okay?

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.490
Hey.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.230
Here.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.330
It's caramel.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.790
It's a tasty
magical power-up.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.430
It can give you strength.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.290
It's sweet!

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.630
It's really sweet!

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.030
I feel energetic!

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.460
That's good.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.190
But, don't you need one too?

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.890
As long as you feel better.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.230
That's all that
matters to me, Hart.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.630
But Kite...

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.290
I will always protect you.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.960
Guards: Take that!
Secure the boy!

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.990
Stop it!

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.530
Let me go, you...

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.930
Hart!

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.130
Heartland City
will be your new home.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.460
You'll like it there.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.630
Let him go!

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.030
This time, I'll
give you the energy.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.060
I will fight them all!

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.830
Hart!

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.430
Yuma!

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.590
Hart Came up here to look for
something called a caramel!

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.060
Caramel?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.590
Are you talking about Candy?

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.160
Hart wants to give a caramel
power-up to his brother.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.330
Caramel power-up?

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.860
This is bad, yuma.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.490
Hart is building up enough Dark

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.790
energy to swallow
the entire city!

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.660
Okay, but what...

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.130
what are we supposed to do?

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.460
Hey, Hart!

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:51.090
Let's go to a Candy store!

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.460
Tori!

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.230
Did you buy a caramel earlier?

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.730
Caramel?

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.430
Here!

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.760
Hey, Hart!

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.960
Check it out!

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.330
Right here!

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.030
I've got a caramel for ya!

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.230
This is what you want, right?

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.890
That's right, here you go.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.630
It's a caramel. We can give
this to Kite. Your brother.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.790
Alright, here goes nothin'!

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:38.790
listen, it's all gonna be
okay. Try to calm down.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.990
My brother.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.290
My brother is very
tired because of me.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.860
I had to come up here to find a
caramel to give to my brother.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.560
To give him strength.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.690
I was able to see
Hart's memories.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.260
Hart and Kite were
hiding on this tower

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.660
and Hart seemed to
be quite upset.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.130
Kite attempted to reassure Hart
by giving him the caramel.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.330
He told him it would
give him strength.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.260
They had been running
away from somebody.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.690
Running, from who?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.390
That answers my question.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.590
I won't let you have Hart!

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.890
If you wanna bring it, then...

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.790
uh...

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.890
who are you?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.430
Quinton: I'm Hart's friend.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.790
I'm here to help.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.490
Isn't that right, Hart?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.230
Wait... uh... hang on.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.790
Hart will be perfectly
safe with me, I assure you.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.960
Let's go.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.060
Hart, wait!

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.430
I thought we were friends.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.890
Why would we be friends?

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.860
I'm on a mission to
destroy astral world.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.730
I will not fail my mission.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.760
Wait!

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.360
What are you talking about?

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.330
His mission...
to destroy astral world?
