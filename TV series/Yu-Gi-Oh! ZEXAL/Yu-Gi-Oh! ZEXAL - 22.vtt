00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.630
[♪...]

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.890
KITE: Hey, Hart, look.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.690
I brought your favorite, little
brother, hot chocolate.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.230
Go on, take a sip.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230
Hart: But where, are we?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.430
Don't you recognize
this cottage?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390
Think back, we lived here when
we were growing up.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.130
We did?

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.460
I can't remember.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.960
Well, I remember how much
happier you were back then.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.890
Nothing could get you down.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.860
You were always laughing
and telling jokes

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.360
But something happened, kid.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.590
You changed.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.860
And I know who did this to you.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.130
Mr. Heartland: Oh

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
so sorry to interrupt
this brotherly reunion.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.730
But I'm afraid it's time for
Hart to get back to work.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430
He needs to rest.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.890
You're pushing Hart WAY too far.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.630
Don't you see, you have
to take it easy on him.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.960
That may be.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.060
All the same, dr.Faker insists
that Hart keep working.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.090
He won't!

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.890
Stay out of this, Kite.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.560
This mission is way too
important for me to give up now.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.590
But Hart

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.660
don't worry about me Kite.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.130
I'm the only one with the power
to save our world, Kite.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.160
I want to do whatever
I can to help.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.860
I know.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.430
It's settled then!

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.330
Dr. Faker will be
thrilled to know you're back

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.490
on the job, Hart!

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.360
And I'm sure Kite will get back
to work tracking down the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.990
numbers we need.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.490
Isn't that right?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.260
You do want your brother
to get better, don't you?

YUMA: Whoa!

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.230
Too cool!

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.860
Ow, that wasn't too cool.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.730
You're sayin' there's a
full-Size airship

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.560
Parked inside my key?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.690
ASTRAL: Correct.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.730
Whoa.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.130
That must be one tight squeeze.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.530
Clearly that key comes from a
place far different

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.060
from this world.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.930
When your parents gave it to
you, they may have realized it

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.730
contained many mysteries.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.990
Cool.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.530
So how do we get the
ship out of the key?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.630
I do not know.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.660
You see the airship has been
constructed like

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.560
a gigantic puzzle.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.390
I am convinced that the numbers
we have been gathering are the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.190
secret to solving this puzzle.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.860
If we succeed in
gathering up all of them

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.660
then we shall see.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.990
Numbers, huh?

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.530
Get it in gear, orbital 7!

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.830
We're going number
hunting again.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.360
Hey, you lazy hunk of junk.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.890
Wake up!

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830
I said wake up!

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.760
Orbital 7: I wasn't sleeping

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.530
just resting my sensors!

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.960
Yeah, right.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.890
Have you finished up that report
yet, listing all the duelists

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.390
who have number cards?

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.560
Er, I kind of forgot.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.760
Your memory circuits
must be failing.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.460
Maybe it's time I traded
you in for a newer model.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.660
Please don't do that!

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.290
I'll whip up that report
in a flash, you'll see!

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.730
I promise!

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.230
While you're at it, find
me the original number.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.290
The original?

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.690
Yes.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.260
Dr. Faker says there was an
original visitor who brought the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.630
numbers to this planet.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.090
I suspect, this mysterious
Visitor may have found

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.130
a host in heartland city.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.860
A host, huh?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.730
I think I have it!

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.960
Remember That boy
yuma you challenged?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.330
I noticed something
during your duel.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.690
He was wearing
a strange pendant.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.530
I'm running a
computer analysis now

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.960
what does it say?

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.430
It confirms that the pendant did
not come from this planet.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.490
Really?

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.060
Orbital!

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.460
Locate Yuma and gather as much
information on him as you can.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.960
And Please do not
make me ask twice!

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.790
I'm on it, boss!

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.460
Our next duel will
be yuma's last.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.590
Out of my way!

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.790
Comin' through!

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.830
I'm gonna be late
for swimming class again!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.290
SHARK: That yuma,
always running behind.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.630
Mr. Kay: Hi there, shark!

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.630
I'm glad to see you
decided to come back to school.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.830
So was yuma the one who
helped to change your mind?

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.060
He certainly does seem to have a
talent for influencing others.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.890
I can't explain why.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.990
Maybe it's his positive attitude
but something about yuma brings

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.990
out the best in people.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.690
Wouldn't you agree
with that, shark?

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.460
Whatever.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.990
Friend a: You think yuma Will
belly-Flop off

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.530
the high dive again?

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.690
TORI: Who knows

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.730
friend B: He never learns.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.860
Tell me about it.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.160
Caswell: Back off from
the pool, yuma!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.990
But I wanna dive.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.230
Not while you're
endangering the rest of us!

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.560
Take that thing off!

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.690
Why should I?

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.190
it is a safety Hazard.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.890
Lose it or move it!

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.630
You're bein' ridiculous.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.860
Cathy: I agree with yuma.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.930
I hate to side
with Caswell here.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.790
But remember your
high dive last week?

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.890
You really
stuck that landing

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.190
get me?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.990
Stuck it?

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.390
I totally belly-Flopped.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.460
You stuck that thing right here!

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.460
Man!

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.860
Like it's my fault Caswell's
head got in the way.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.790
I should be more careful
with this key though.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.490
Not only is it incredibly
valuable and mysterious

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.530
but it's sort of like
astral's home, too.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.890
Maybe I can learn
something from yuma.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.860
I feel so trashy
in this disguise.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.690
That locker room should be
around here somewhere

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.760
numbers hold the
secret, to this ship

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.590
and also to my memories.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.690
We have ten number cards so far.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.860
Some have left me with more
questions than answers.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.830
And that truly concerns me.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.460
My memory is weak.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.590
I will need even more
number cards if I am going

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.830
to solve the
mysteries that surround me.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.460
This must be the locker room.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.730
I can tell by the odor.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.230
Now which locker is yuma's?

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.490
Target identified.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.860
Sorry but finders, keepers!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.060
That was too easy.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.960
This doesn't belong to you.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.290
I was just, uh

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.860
borrowing it from
my good Buddy yuma.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.960
Give it back or he'll be mad!

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.960
I think you're a lying thief.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.590
That was a big mistake.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.130
I look puny outside,
but inside I pack a lot

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.160
of dangerous surprises!

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.430
Now hand it over shorty

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.590
or I'll start drilling for it!

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.590
What kind of robot are you?

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.130
The nasty kind!

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.790
Come back here, coward!

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.690
How odd.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.090
Why is it stopping?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.290
The numbers are disengaging.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.230
Why is this occurring?

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.530
I sense something is wrong.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.560
I want that pendant!

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.560
That's enough, orbital!

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.230
I didn't authorize an attack.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.760
I never have fun

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.890
why don't you do yourself a
favor and hand that

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.890
pendant over to me right now!?

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.130
not a chance.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.130
This thing isn't yours pal!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.090
I know, it belongs
to yuma tsukumo.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.890
And how do you know yuma?

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.230
Well, let's just say his number
cards Drew my interest.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.830
Oh, I get it.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.490
You must be that number
Hunter I been hearin' about.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.030
So tell me, are you a duelist?

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.830
Do you have any number
cards in your possession?

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.790
There's one way to find out.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.790
Exactly what I was thinking.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.190
I'll take your number
and that pendant.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.460
This match'll be for double.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.690
Or nothing!

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.460
I was totally heading for
trouble until yuma pulled me

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.230
back from the Brink.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.690
I owe him big-time.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.460
and today I'm payin' him back.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.130
Okay Hunter, bring it!

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.790
Photon Transformation go!

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.890
Duel Disk locked and
ready for action!

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:21.960
Yeah!

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.390
Duel Gazer go!

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.390
Prepare to meet defeat!

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.030
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.390
Let's duel!

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.460
School ANNOUNCER: Security
report to the field house!

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.890
Freaky.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.390
Super freaky!

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.960
BRONK: Looks like a war zone.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.130
Whoever pulled this prank is in
for some serious detention time.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.790
I can't find it, it's not here!

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.490
My key is gone!

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.530
Ready?

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.260
I'll go first.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.390
Let's do this!

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.130
I draw!

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.830
Since This guy hunts numbers, I
bet he's gonna build his whole

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.230
strategy around them.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.130
But I've got a plan that should
zero out his numbers.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.230
To start, I'll send big jaws to
the graveyard and activate the

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.960
shark Lair spell card.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.760
With this in play, your monsters
that have equal or less attack

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.460
points than the monster
I sent to the graveyard

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.960
can no longer attack!

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.190
Shark and big jaws has a
whopping 1800 attack points

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.330
Good luck summoning a
monster with more attack

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.860
points that that.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.230
Next up, I summon shocktopus!

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.490
Then I'll end my turn
with a facedown.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.690
C'mon, Hunter, use a number

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.130
watch and learn
from a real duelist.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.860
I draw!

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.860
First I activate polymerization!

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.990
A spell card?

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.990
Yes, that's right and next I'm
gonna use its power to fuse

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.990
these two photon lizards,
so that I can summon

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.490
twin photon lizard to my field!

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.860
As you can see my monster
is way more powerful

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.190
than your big jaws!

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.530
I didn't count on him not going
straight for an xyz summon.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.060
Looks like I'll have to
play at the top of my game

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.930
to out-Duel this guy.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.260
With Twin photon lizard out,
your shark Lair Spell card can't

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.960
protect you anymore.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.890
Your pathetic
strategy failed miserably.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.090
Now twin Photon lizard attack!

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.760
Go Photon force!

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.630
I didn't fail anything

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.160
I activate shocktopus'
special ability!

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.590
Now shocktpus equips on
to twin photon lizard and

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.490
sucks out its strength!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.330
Your lizard not only loses all
its attack points, but it can't

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.960
change battle mode
anymore either!

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.260
You see that!

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.330
It doesn't matter what you try
to throw my way, I'm

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.060
always one step ahead!

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.560
You played me, but I
played you right back.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.530
Next turn, I'm gonna
take a serious bite out of

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.960
your life points!

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.460
Well Wipe my drive!

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.030
That twerp smacked you down!

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.890
I can counter that move easily.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.160
Oh yeah?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.530
I activate twin photon
lizard's special ability!

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.660
Now Twin Photon lizard splits
back into two photon lizards!

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.060
His level 3 monsters are back.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.090
This can only mean one thing!

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.230
I overlay my level 3 photon
lizards in order

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.690
to build the overlay network!

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.460
I xyz summon, number 30:
Acid golem of destruction!

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.230
I was hoping
he'd use a number

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.630
and this one has
3000 attack points!

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.430
It's the perfect moment
to spring my trap.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.490
I activate splash capture!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.230
Since you xyz summoned, if I
take two fish-Type monsters from

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.990
my graveyard and
banish 'em from play

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.230
I get control of
your xyz monster!

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.030
So now, I banish both
big jaws and shocktopus!

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.960
You were so predictable.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.330
I was positive you'd summon one
of your numbers and I was right!

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.130
My trap worked like a charm.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.030
You thought acid Golem would
devastate my deck but I just

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.460
turned it against you!

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.660
Number Hunter, I
now control your acid golem

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.390
and all of its power!

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.530
Once it strikes, you're through.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.790
Master Kite, you should have let
me take care of him before!

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.590
Stay out of this orbital.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.490
If you insist.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.890
It's my move!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.730
I activate the
spell forced release!

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.460
Now Acid golem loses all
of its overlay units.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.360
Then I place one card facedown.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.190
And end my turn.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.090
That spell of yours
didn't get you out of danger.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.130
Acid golem still has
3000 attack points.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.330
And I can't wait to use them!

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.660
You fool.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.660
Don't use realize that acid
golem is still going

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.930
to help me win this duel?!

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:40.960
help you?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.390
Even though you control
it now, acid golem is

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.290
still doing my dirty work!

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.960
It might have 3000 attack points
But its huge strength is

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.560
balanced out
by great weaknesses.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.630
Yeah, like what?

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.290
Here's one thing

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.930
it must use an overlay
unit each one of your turns

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.360
or you take damage.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.860
Two thousand life
points to be exact.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.030
Hold on.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.290
You're forgetting on
thing, number Hunter.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.660
It can still attack!

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.690
Now go acid golem!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.690
Start Blasting away!

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.760
It can't.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.160
Why not?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.360
Because acid Golem needs overlay
units in order to attack.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.660
So it's powerless now.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.530
You were doomed from the start.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.890
Since I was expecting
you to try and take control of

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.460
my number, I set you up.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.660
Guess I'm the one who
fell into a trap then.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.890
That number Hunter
knows his stuff.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.960
Underestimating
him was careless.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.230
This duel is done if I don't
think of something fast.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.160
But what?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.560
It seems hopeless

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.790
wait.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.360
Yuma wouldn't give up.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.490
And neither will I!

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.660
I play a facedown
and end my turn.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.730
You're up.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.090
And you're going down!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.690
I draw!

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.360
I still have a chance.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.330
With my facedown card life
regeneration, I won't take

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.860
damage from acid golem's special
ability on my next turn.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.090
That should buy me some time
till I can figure out how

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.190
to beat this guy!

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.960
I'm activating the
spell, photon sublimation!

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.530
So by banishing
two photon monsters

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.630
I can draw two more cards.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.160
And that is bad news for
you and your life points!

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.990
And now I draw!

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.060
I special summon
photon Thrasher!

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.130
And next I
summon photon crusher!

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.960
But neither one is hanging
around because I have something

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.730
bigger and badder in mind!

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.060
Prepare yourself!

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.160
Wait.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160
What are you doing?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.190
Just watch!

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.530
This next monster can only be
summoned by Tributing 2 monsters

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.060
with 2000 or more attack points!

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.790
It's quite large, you
might even say astronomical!

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.790
Once This monster attacks,
yuma's pendant and your number

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.430
will both be mine!

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.160
Oh no!

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.590
Say hello to
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.130
Come on, astral!

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.490
Where are you!?

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.130
oh man!

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.060
That wasn't in
today's weather forecast!

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.590
I've never seen a
storm like it before.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.890
I wonder if it's

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.990
hey!

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.530
Something is happening in the
world outside this key

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.260
what is this!?

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.230
the hour for action is
approaching

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:06.260
you need the power of
zexal, the power that changes

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.460
all darkness into light.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.760
the power of zexal!

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.230
There must be some way
out C'mon, think!

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.960
It's all over.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.390
Go photon stream of destruction!

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.460
Hold up - Why are you
attacking with that monster?

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.030
It's impossible!

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.390
Galaxy-Eyes isn't a number card.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.530
Only a number can
destroy a number.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.090
Wrong again.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.990
Once acid golem loses its
overlay Units, that rule no

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.430
longer applies.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.190
That's why galaxy-Eyes
was free to destroy it.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.930
In that case, you just
made a giant tactical

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.590
blunder, didn't you?

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.090
With acid golem on the field I
would've taken massive damage.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.430
By destroying it, you
saved me from its curse and

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.230
kept me in the duel!

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.590
You've already lost.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.830
How's that?

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.130
Because you're still under
acid golem's curse.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.590
When it's destroyed, the
duelist controlling it takes

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.060
2000 points of damage.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.760
Which means your number card
belongs to me now, along with

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.890
Yuma's pendant!

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.960
That's can't be.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.690
Please forgive me, yuma.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.660
I'll take that number now.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.430
Along with your soul as well.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.530
I don't understand this.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.830
There is no number.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.560
Shark!

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.090
Hello, yuma.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.830
Long time, no see Kite!

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.590
Shark!

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.860
He's really hurt.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.090
What have you done!?

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.430
master Kite, the
photon mode is 85 percent!

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.930
No more dueling, please.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.360
It is time to move out!

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.060
Relax, we're leaving.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.960
Hey, leave that
alone - It's mine!

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.360
Oh No, he's got astral!

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.060
Kite, come back here!
