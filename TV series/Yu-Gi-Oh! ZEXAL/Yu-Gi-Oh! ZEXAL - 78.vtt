WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.281
There's no way I
did bad on that test.

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.517
I stayed up all night studying.

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:07.785
How do you guys think you did?

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.927
That was a lot easier than
I thought it would be.

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:11.362
(man)
Yuma... Hey!

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.231
Do we know you?

00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.366
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.067
Art Stanley.

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.036
President of the Comic Book
Appreciation Club,

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:21.906
Heartland City Chapter,
charter pending.

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:23.207
I never heard of you guys.

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:26.110
That's because they
only have one member.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.045
I have a little favor to ask.

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:32.316
Our organization is going to
create a literary masterpiece.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:36.854
And for the hero of our tale,
we wanna use you, Yuma!

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.357
You want me to
be in your comic?

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:41.359
That's incredible, Yuma!
Yeah!

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.062
The champion of the Duel
Carnival, the legend among men,

00:00:45.062 --> 00:00:48.933
I present to you,
the ultimate hero.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.668
(Yuma)
Whoa...
I'm awesome!

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:51.769
Glad you think so!

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.370
One last question.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.106
I'm aware of the many ways
in which you are awesome,

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.676
but I'm curious...
What's your weak point?

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.244
Uh, my weak point?

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:01.812
That's an easy one.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:04.248
I don't have one!

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:09.153
Every hero has a weakness,
it's... Hang on.

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:11.355
Uh, pardon me, Shark?

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.357
Art Stanley...
Hi, I'm making a comic book.

00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:17.762
I've modeled a character after
you named "The Nightshark."

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:18.829
Awesome, right?

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.366
I just need your permission
to put it in the comic.

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.136
It's lame.

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:26.370
So is that a yes?

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.338
Are you touching me?

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.740
Could I get you to sign
a release form?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.776
Back off!

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.953
Don't even think about it.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.825
You dropped your sketchbook.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:49.060
Thank you, kind sir!

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.363
This little book contains
every scribble, doodle, idea,

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:54.665
and design I've ever
had in my life.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.369
I don't know what
I'd do if I lost it.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.270
Cool.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.206
Well, can't wait to see
it when it's all done.

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.375
I'm looking
forward to the comic book.

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.178
Hey, Shark wait up!

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.381
(Yuma)
How do you think
you did on that test?

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.883

I wish I could
make things better.

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.223

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:36.367
What do you expect me to
do with those things, Rio?

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.836
I'm your big brother,
not your sister.

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:40.705
That's a mean thing to say!

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:44.375
Just forget it then!

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.377
See if I care!

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:03.627
Rio... I would do anything
to keep you safe...

00:04:07.298 --> 00:04:08.232
(Girag) Shark?

00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:10.368
What sort of name is Shark?

00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.369
(Art) It's a nickname.

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.171
The point is, I couldn't
find Yuma's weak point,

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.073
but I did find Shark's.

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:18.876
I can get his Number Card.

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:23.381
I've already laid out my
entire plan in this sketchbook.

00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.383
It's perfect.

00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:27.318
All right.

00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:28.719
Go for it.

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.822
For the glory of Barian World!

00:04:31.822 --> 00:04:34.058
Before you head out...

00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:36.827
I'm working on
a comic book too!

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:39.130
Oh...
Whaddya think?

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.602
(Ray)
We brought enough
gifts, right?

00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:46.070
Guys, I told you.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.004
Rio is still asleep.

00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:48.372
She hasn't woken up in weeks.

00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:52.376
So this candy...
Ray, she can't eat
any of it.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.377
That's perfect!

00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:56.046
More sugary goodness for me!

00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:01.218
Hey there, Shark!

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.287
We came by to see your sister.

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:04.088
She's gone.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.356
She's not in her room.

00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:07.191
She disappeared!

00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:08.092
(Yuma) Disappeared?

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:09.226
What are you talking about?

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:12.730
(Art)
Oh, good, you're
all together!

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.065
What're you doing here, Art?

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.235
Actually, I came
here to talk about Rio.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:21.305
Hey, how do you know about Rio?

00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:24.775
Did you...
do something?

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.044
I happen to know
where your sister is...

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.379
If you want me to tell you,

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:31.282
then you are going
to have to duel me.

00:05:31.282 --> 00:05:32.983
You want a duel?

00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:36.187
Just tell us where she is!

00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:36.587
Yuma...

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:40.357
I sense something strange
about this person.

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:42.359
What do you say, Shark?

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:43.861
Shall we duel?

00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:47.364
You're gonna regret
messing with my sister.

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:49.900
Duel Disk locked!

00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:54.371
Duel Gazer loaded!

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:59.343
(computer)
Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.

00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:02.780
(both) Let's duel!

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.916
You're gonna wish you
hadn't messed with me.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.651
I draw!

00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:10.988
I summon Shocktopus!

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.959
But it won't be
sticking around for long,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:20.364
'cause by tributing it, I
can summon Sharkraken!

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.371
And with that, I place one
card facedown and end my turn!

00:06:27.371 --> 00:06:29.006
Here we go.

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:30.007
I draw!

00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:32.376
First of all, I think
this duel should be set

00:06:32.376 --> 00:06:34.078
in a different location!

00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:36.213
Welcome to the Comic Fields!

00:06:36.213 --> 00:06:38.816
This kingdom is the product
of my imagination

00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:43.220
and everything that transpires
in it is all part of my story!

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.357
It's a rather epic tale of a
brave and noble hero

00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:48.192
who looks an awful lot like me,

00:06:48.192 --> 00:06:51.262
who embarks on a harrowing quest
climaxing in the defeat

00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:55.366
of the evil Lord Shark
also known as "The Nightshark."

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:59.370
Our story begins with
the summoning of Lancelot,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.906
Knight of the Lake!

00:07:03.374 --> 00:07:05.743
And then from
my hand I activate

00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:08.379
Vow of the Sword spell card!

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.180
When I've got a
Warrior on my field...

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.851
This spell allows me to summon
another warrior to the battle

00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:14.919
to fight by its side!

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.357
Take a knee in honor of
Tristan, Knight of Tragedy.

00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:25.296
In one move, he was able to
summon two Level 4 monsters

00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:26.363
to his field.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.364
That's not all...

00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:30.367
I overlay Lancelot and Tristan!

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.869
With these two monsters,

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:35.372
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.376
Comics Hero King Arthur!

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.384
And before I forget...

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.386
When Lancelot becomes
an Overlay Unit,

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.055
its special ability activates,

00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:55.993
stripping one of your monsters
of 800 attack points.

00:07:55.993 --> 00:07:57.895
Now charge, King Arthur!

00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.730
Attack Sharkraken!

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.900
I'd be shaking in
my shoes if my facedown card

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.368
wasn't Zeus' Breath!

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.370
But I'm afraid it is!

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.771
It stops your monster's attack

00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:11.342
and slams you with
800 points of damage!

00:08:11.342 --> 00:08:14.278
Better luck next time, Stanley!

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:17.081
But I thought you
cared about your sister.

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:18.382
What do you mean?

00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:19.383
Oh, right!

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:20.851
I haven't told you yet.

00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.187
You want to know where
your sister is?

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:26.590
Little Rio is in the world
my imagination created,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.960
locked in a
dungeon in Castle...

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.096
Oh, let's call it
"Castle Artopia"

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:35.866
in the kingdom
of "Stanleyus!"

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.904
If you defeat me, the kingdom of
Stanleyus will be destroyed,

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:41.705
and if that happens,

00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:44.708
then who knows what'll
happen to your sister?

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.844
Something tragic probably.

00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:49.246
You think this is funny?

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:50.781
That is seriously low.

00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.951
Yeah, what can Shark do?

00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:55.386
I'm so sorry, Shark.

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:56.587
You can't win this one.

00:08:56.587 --> 00:09:01.225
And once it's all over,
your Number Card will be mine!

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:05.295
King Arthur attack
with Radiant Sword!

00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:15.272
And with that done,
I end my turn

00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:17.908
by placing one card facedown.

00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.209
Your move, Shark!

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:19.710
Not cool.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.846
What's Shark supposed to do?

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.917
(Girag) Good job, kid.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:28.752
That Number Card is ours.

00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:31.655
We've gotta find a way
to get Rio out of there.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:34.692
This field is a world that
Art Stanley conjured

00:09:34.692 --> 00:09:35.826
through some kind of power.

00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:39.363
Since he is the world's
creator, he controls it.

00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:43.033
"The world's creator..."

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:44.001
I got it!

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.036
Remember his sketchbook?

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:46.904
Yeah...

00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:48.372
This story of
his might be in it!

00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:52.342
If he drew this magic world in
that book, then we might be...

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:55.379
Then we might be
able to erase it!

00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:03.287
We've gotta find
that sketchbook!

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:07.758
It's my turn!

00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:08.859
I draw!

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:11.795
And now I summon Hammer Shark!

00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:17.367
That monster's
not worthy enough!

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.370
I want your Number!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.007
I guess you're gonna make
me force your hand.

00:10:24.007 --> 00:10:27.377
By activating my
trap Ordeal of the Hero!

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.813
Now things are really gonna
get interesting.

00:10:29.813 --> 00:10:32.382
This trap forces you to
select and summon two monsters

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.753
from your deck with
the same Level as Hammer Shark.

00:10:35.753 --> 00:10:38.021
So get to drawing, Shark!

00:10:38.021 --> 00:10:40.891
There's no getting
outta this... do it!

00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:44.995
All right, pencil neck, we'll
do things your way for now.

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:49.032
I summon Spear Shark
and Double Shark!

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:52.669
Now use all three of them
to bring out a challenger

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:53.804
worthy of my hero!

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:59.109
I overlay Hammer Shark,
Spear Shark and Double Shark.

00:10:59.109 --> 00:11:02.379
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:11:02.613 --> 00:11:07.184
and Xyz Summon Number
32: Shark Drake!

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:17.027
What do you want me to do next?

00:11:17.027 --> 00:11:20.364
If I attack, something
could happen to my sister.

00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:20.964
Not true!

00:11:20.964 --> 00:11:23.367
You can attack me
as much as you want.

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:24.201
How's that?

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.068
It's all part of my story!

00:11:25.068 --> 00:11:27.671
The evil Nightshark comes to
Castle Artopia to kidnap

00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:31.074
the slumbering princess so
that he can steal her power!

00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:33.210
But the great hero,
Artimus Stanleyus,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.346
arrives to rescue the
princess for the forces of good.

00:11:36.346 --> 00:11:37.881
And a battle ensues!

00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:39.249
All right, then!

00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:41.084
Do it, Shark Drake!

00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:43.287
Attack King Arthur!

00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:45.656
Deep Sea Destruction!

00:11:56.099 --> 00:12:00.370
No way... The great King Arthur
has been destroyed...

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.105
King Arthur!

00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:05.108
The entire fate of the
kingdom hangs in the balance...

00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:07.878
You've gotta stand
up and battle!

00:12:07.878 --> 00:12:12.816
And battle you will because now
I activate Comic Field's effect!

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:15.085
When a Comic Hero on
the field falls in battle,

00:12:15.085 --> 00:12:21.058
it's able to rise again, 500
attack points stronger!

00:12:24.361 --> 00:12:25.062
Furthermore...

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:27.164
When King Arthur's
attack points change,

00:12:27.164 --> 00:12:29.266
it can activate its
special ability.

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:31.969
By using one Overlay Unit,
it can dish out damage

00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:35.372
equal to the amount
of attack points it gained!

00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:37.174
Storm Sword!

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.047
Oh no, Shark!

00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:47.718
That's what you get,
you wretched spawn of evil!

00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:52.356
I'm placing one card
facedown and ending my turn.

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:56.960
That's a good Shark,
and now I draw!

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.631
I equip King Arthur
with Miracle Sword!

00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:05.369
This fabled blade grants it
500 additional attack points.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.372
Its attack points
changed again...

00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.707
Once more, by using
an Overlay Unit...

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:14.945
Comics Hero King Arthur
deals you damage!

00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:17.281
Go Storm Sword!

00:13:21.652 --> 00:13:26.290
And now, the valiant
King Arthur attacks Shark Drake!

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.358
Flash Sword!

00:13:32.362 --> 00:13:36.133
So here's where my epic tale
hit its first plot wall,

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:39.369
A Number can only be
destroyed by another Number.

00:13:39.603 --> 00:13:42.372
But I found a way
around that pesky rule

00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:44.174
and worked it into my story.

00:13:44.174 --> 00:13:47.377
I now activate
Miracle Sword's effect!

00:13:47.377 --> 00:13:50.213
When King Arthur fails
to destroy your monster,

00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:53.383
I can send this mighty blade
to the graveyard

00:13:53.383 --> 00:13:57.321
to activate a
spell card from my hand.

00:13:57.321 --> 00:14:00.624
I will smite evil in the name
of Barian World.

00:14:00.624 --> 00:14:05.629
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Barian's Force!

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:06.129
Oh, no!

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:07.764
He's from Barian World!?

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.101
With this power, I
rebuild the Overlay Network

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.972
with Comics Hero King Arthur!

00:14:15.372 --> 00:14:18.642
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:14:18.642 --> 00:14:21.178
Barian power, born of chaos,

00:14:21.178 --> 00:14:23.914
visit your judgment on
this world of filth!

00:14:23.914 --> 00:14:29.920
Come forth, Choas Xyz Comics
Hero Legend Arthur!

00:14:32.255 --> 00:14:34.624
That monster's got
3,000 attack points!

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:39.363
And thanks to Rank-up-Magic,
your Xyz Monster's Overlay Units

00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:42.366
now belong to Legend Arthur!

00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:45.202
Chaos Drain!

00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.306
That's not all!

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.775
For every Overlay Unit
that I stole,

00:14:51.775 --> 00:14:55.846
your monster
loses 300 attack points.

00:14:55.846 --> 00:14:58.315
And now we arrive at
my favorite part!

00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:01.184
Barian's Force gives
my Chaos Xyz Monster

00:15:01.184 --> 00:15:03.687
the power to destroy Numbers.

00:15:03.687 --> 00:15:04.721
Go, Legend Arthur!

00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:09.159
Attack Shark Drake
with Shockwave Slash!

00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:17.234
(Yuma) <i>Shark!</i>

00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:19.036
<i>Shark, can you hear me?</i>

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:19.970
<i>Yuma?</i>

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.837
<i>Is that you?</i>

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:21.705
Shark, we found it!

00:15:21.705 --> 00:15:25.375
We found Art's sketchbook in the
club's meeting room at school.

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:28.612
It's got a bunch of
pages from his comic book.

00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:29.846
It's all here!

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.682
Your sister is like
a princess or something,

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:33.383
<i>but she's captured.</i>

00:15:33.617 --> 00:15:38.055
<i>And then you're like some</i>
evilthief guy trying to get to her.

00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:38.688
Rio...

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.091
So you found my masterpiece.

00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.894
What were you hoping to
accomplish by finding it?

00:15:43.894 --> 00:15:46.797
It's not like you can
change the ending.

00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:48.832
How does it end?

00:15:48.832 --> 00:15:51.368
Oh, it's epically sad.

00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:53.203
A real tear-jerker.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.372
Lord Shark and
the heroic knight battle

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.240
for the slumbering Princess.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.610
In the end, the Nightshark
falls to the ground,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.379
defeated by Sir Artimus.

00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:06.116
But unfortunately,
Sir Artimus is too late

00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:09.853
and the princess is lost
to an eternal sleep.

00:16:09.853 --> 00:16:14.091
In other words, you
lose the duel and the girl!

00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:15.192
No way!

00:16:15.192 --> 00:16:19.729
You have to admit,
it's a great twist!

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:20.230
So then...

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.800
there's... There"'s
nothing we can do.

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:30.240
(Ray)
Shark can't win this duel...
There's nothing we can do!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.143
There's gotta be a way!

00:16:33.143 --> 00:16:34.377
<i>You can dothis, Shark!</i>

00:16:34.377 --> 00:16:35.812
<i>Just get upand duel!</i>

00:16:35.812 --> 00:16:39.850
<i>You can change the ending</i>
tothis story, I know you can!

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.386
You're not gonna let some
fan fiction decide your fate,

00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:45.689
are ya?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.692
He's right.

00:16:48.692 --> 00:16:53.029
(Rio)
Win for me, Reginald...
For Rio.

00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:57.367
Rio, I need you to hear me.

00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:00.237
Rio, can you hear me?

00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:03.206
Rio, wake up!

00:17:03.206 --> 00:17:05.809
Rio!

00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:10.647
Rio?

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.156
(Rio) Reginald!

00:17:19.156 --> 00:17:20.357
Up here!

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.376
Rio.

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:40.744
No way!

00:17:40.744 --> 00:17:41.978
How!

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.313
She's awake!

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:44.181
What happened?

00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.715
She's okay!
Yeah!

00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:48.084
It would seem that Shark
was able to break through

00:17:48.084 --> 00:17:51.888
Art Stanley's magic and
save his sister.

00:17:51.888 --> 00:17:53.356
Uh, Shark?

00:17:53.356 --> 00:17:56.359
It looks like you're
losing a duel.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.761
Come on, Reginald.

00:17:57.761 --> 00:17:59.663
You losing is embarrassing.

00:17:59.663 --> 00:18:02.165
I've been losing
'cause of you.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:03.600
(Art) This is an outrage!

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.903
Nobody's allowed to
rewrite my story but me!

00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:10.373
I activate Legend Arthur's
special ability!

00:18:10.373 --> 00:18:12.242
When your monster
is destroyed in battle,

00:18:12.242 --> 00:18:15.312
I can use one Overlay Unit to
pluck it from the graveyard,

00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:18.181
banish it, and then
slam you with damage

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:22.852
equal to that monster's
attack points.

00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:30.126
I'm gonna change your
story a little bit...

00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:33.363
By activating my
Torrential Reborn trap card,

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.265
which I can do
since you destroyed

00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:37.367
my Water Attribute monster.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.369
So, thanks for that.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.371
Now, I can re-summon
Shark Drake

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.374
and deal you
500 points of damage!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.082
That's no good...

00:18:52.082 --> 00:18:55.785
And now, it's time to draw!

00:18:55.785 --> 00:18:58.355
Shark Drake, the time has come!

00:18:58.355 --> 00:19:00.757
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:19:00.757 --> 00:19:06.296
Appear Chaos Number 32,
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:11.167
By using one Overlay Unit,
I can banish a Shark monster

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:15.939
from my graveyard to lower your
monster's attack points!

00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:19.376
I'm banishing Shark Drake,

00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:24.381
which means Legend Arthur
loses 2,800 attack points.

00:19:29.953 --> 00:19:34.057
And now I activate the spell
Surging Erosion!

00:19:34.057 --> 00:19:36.092
This card destroys Comic Field.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:39.696
So say goodbye to your
little doodles!

00:19:45.368 --> 00:19:47.370
What have you done
to my masterpiece?!

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.140
Did I mention yet that Surging
Erosion gives all

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.210
my Water Attribute
monsters 500 attack points?

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.848
Do it, Shark Drake Veiss!

00:19:58.848 --> 00:20:00.650
Attack Legend Arthur!

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.286
Chaos Stream!

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.135
<i>I knew you coulddo it, Shark!</i>

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.370
<i>That was awesome!</i>

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.707
<i>Seriously, Shark, that wasa great comeback!</i>

00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:26.676
Where am I?

00:20:26.676 --> 00:20:28.378
<i>You rocked that duel!</i>

00:20:28.378 --> 00:20:30.947
<i>Team Shark for the win!</i>

00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:35.085
(Girag)
I'm getting sick and
tired leaving empty handed.

00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:37.787
I need to find better puppets.

00:20:41.358 --> 00:20:43.693
Let's go home.

00:20:52.802 --> 00:20:54.237
♪ ♪

00:20:54.237 --> 00:20:54.904
(Art) Shark!

00:20:54.904 --> 00:20:57.674
A moment of your time,
my good fellow!

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.109
Feast your eyes on this!

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:04.381
I drew up a new hero character
using you as inspiration.

00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:05.281
Aww!

00:21:05.281 --> 00:21:06.816
That is solid!

00:21:06.816 --> 00:21:09.386
Solidly lame.

00:21:09.386 --> 00:21:10.720
So what about me?

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.821
Am I in it?

00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:12.822
Uh...

00:21:12.822 --> 00:21:15.325
Yeah, right here.

00:21:16.092 --> 00:21:18.261
You're the sidekick.

00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:20.096
Comic relief.

00:21:20.096 --> 00:21:20.462
Hey!

00:21:20.462 --> 00:21:23.199
Observation Number 21:
Yuma would make a good

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.368
cartoon character in real life.

00:21:25.602 --> 00:21:27.137
You got that right.

00:21:27.137 --> 00:21:30.373
Why can't I be the hero?
