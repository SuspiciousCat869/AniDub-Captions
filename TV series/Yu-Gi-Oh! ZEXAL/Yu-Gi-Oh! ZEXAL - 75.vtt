Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:07.174
(Dumon)
Our plan was to
give power to humans

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.609
so they would
steal Numbers

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.911
and destroy
Astral World.

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.248
Unfortunately, Vetrix
and Faker were both defeated

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.350
by the
power of Zexal.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.785
You are a brave
Barian warrior.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.288
I know you
can do the job.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.758

single Number.

So this is Yuma

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.136
Who is
this guy?

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.472
I can be your
new best friend.

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.974
'Cause I can give
you real power.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.745
Power enough to rule
your whole pathetic planet!

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:49.249

work for Barian World.

better hold on to this.

Astral's safety.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.310
Now hand over those Numbers
and be quick about it!

want my Numbers?

You're saying...

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:54.293
So you're saying that the two
of you stopped my entire gang?

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:57.763
(groaning)

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:07.173
Just
you two?

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:09.041
Yeah,
just us two.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.643
We
handled them.

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:12.745
You want some
of what they got?

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:14.313
(orbital 7)
Direct attack!

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:19.351
(shouting)

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:25.157
Mission
accomplished.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.594
(chuckling)

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:33.165
(Girag)
Looks like those three are
gonna make things interesting.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:37.903
Good thing we got
lots planned for 'em..

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:43.142
Yuma, I believe it is safe
to say that this individual

00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:45.644
was being controlled
by a Barian power

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:49.014
similar to the one
that controlled Dr. Faker.

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.483
Barian.

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:53.886
(the gang)
Yuma.

00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:55.454
(Bronk)
You did it, Yuma!

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.989
(Cathy)
You were great!

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:57.923
Of course.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.159
Nobody's
gonna beat me!

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.327
My my....

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:02.962
Still so
humble.

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:04.430
Yeah.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.432
(Kite)
Yuma.

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.201
I don't think we've heard
the last from Barian World.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:12.004
My gut says this
just the beginning.

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:15.007
Guys, that doesn't
scare me one bit!

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.043
As long as we combine our
powers and work as a team,

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:22.314
there's no way
anybody can beat us.

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:26.619
'Cause I'm gonna
high five the sky!
