00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:02.187
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal."

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.420
(Kite)
Vetrix, this moment
is long overdue.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:10.287
I'm here to avenge what you've
done to my brother, Hart.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.287
This I promise.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.654
<i>(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision Link
established.</i>

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:15.354
Let's Duel!
Let's Duel!

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.120
Galaxy-Eyes,

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:20.920
Attack Vetrix with
Photon Stream of Destruction.

00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:28.487
(laughing maniacally)

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.454
What, this can't be?

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:31.954
How can you have any
life points left?

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:33.487
Are you shocked?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.387
Because I assure you
you haven't seen anything yet.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.987
Because Kite,
I've been saving

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.087
a little surprise for you
all this time.

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:47.387
(Vetrix/Hart)
Why do you keep attacking me?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.454
It hurts, Kite.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:54.287
Impossible.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.554
No, it's true.

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:59.220
Our minds joined together,
and we became one.

00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:00.620
Hey Kite.

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:02.320
I'll find Hart and free him
from Vetrix.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.087
Come on, Orbital.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.554
(Vetrix/Hart)
Go, Genom Heritage.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.454
Attack his Dyson Sphere.

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:10.020
Flash Impact!

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.654
Vetrix!

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.120
Enjoying the show,
Faker?

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:21.720
Ingenious, isn't it?

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:23.387
You're about to watch
both your sons

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.454
get crushed
in the same duel.

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.254

(Mr. Heartland)
Whoa, no, your eyes are not
playing tricks on you.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.887
Genom-Heritage just destroyed
Dyson Sphere,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.087
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.654
Know what that means?

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:41.654
Well...

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:44.954
It means Vetrix has dueled Kite
into a corner.

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:46.987
Kite's really been
pulling his punches.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.754
His dueling seems sloppy.

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:50.920
You'd think there was something
was wrong with him.

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:53.287
I hope he gets his
head in the game fast.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.920
(Vetrix/Hart)
I know my link to Hart
is hard to believe,

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.454
but it's all true.

00:02:57.487 --> 00:03:00.487
Any pain I feel,
Vetrix feels.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.787
And any pain that I feel,
Hart feels too.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.120
I'll show ya.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:11.820
It's Hart.

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:13.320
Hart, can you hear me?

00:03:16.187 --> 00:03:20.054
He can't hear you,
but he can feel me.

00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:21.654
(laughing)

00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:23.787
If I can feel it,
Hart can feel it.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.120
Pretty neat, huh?

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.254
You think this is funny,
you twisted monster.

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:28.487
Let my brother go.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.054
Ahh, Vetrix!

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:36.954
I swear I will make you
pay for this.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.654
Hart, hang on.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.287
I'm on my way.

00:03:45.748 --> 00:03:47.448
(Vetrix/Hart)
I believe it's your turn.

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:49.882
You could attack us with
your Galaxy-Eyes...

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:52.782
... that is, if you
don't care about me.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.448
(Kite)
How do I play this?.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:57.315
If I attack, I'll injure Hart.

00:03:57.348 --> 00:04:00.548
But if I don't,
I could lose the duel.

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:01.948
And my victory could mean

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:04.615
freeing Hart of Vetrix
once and for all.

00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:06.115
(groaning)

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:09.148
I have to decide if helping Hart
is worth hurting him.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.382
I draw!

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:13.548
(Kite)
Hang in there,
little brother.

00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:17.515
I'm coming for you,
Vetrix.

00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.148
And Hart, trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:22.615
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon

00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:26.015
attack Heraldic King
Genom-Heritage.

00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.748
Go Photon
Stream of Destruction!

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:42.082
(Vetrix/Hart)
How could you, Kite?

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:45.982
What's wrong with you?

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:49.482
You blasted your own
little brother?

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.948
You'll hurt me
just to win a duel.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:53.948
I had you all wrong.

00:04:53.982 --> 00:04:55.848
I thought
you loved me?

00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.882
(laughing)

00:04:57.915 --> 00:04:58.915
I end my turn.

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.615
Orbital, gee, maybe I just
should have walked.

00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:04.182
Can't you go any faster?

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:05.548
Oh yeah?

00:05:05.582 --> 00:05:07.848
You wanna see fast--
I'll show you fast.

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:10.515
Hang on wise guy,
we're going in!

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.182
Whoa.

00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:18.348
Don't worry about
a thing, Yuma.

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:20.382
I expected those.

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:22.015
Yes, just as I thought.

00:05:22.048 --> 00:05:25.148
Dr. Faker's security system
is working perfectly.

00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:26.082
Here we go.

00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:30.115
My turn, I draw!

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:31.482
You know, Kite.

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:33.282
I hope you and I
dueling each other

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:35.815
doesn't create any bad
blood between us.

00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:37.315
I'm totally serious.

00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:40.048
I really want to strengthen
our brotherly bonds.

00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:42.782
And my next move
is designed to do just that.

00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:46.515
I equip Heraldry Curse
on Genom-Heritage.

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:49.682
Now once per turn, both of us
take 300 points of damage

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.682
for each monster
on the field.

00:05:55.215 --> 00:05:56.815
There are two
monsters on the field.

00:05:56.848 --> 00:05:59.215
So we each take 600
points of damage.

00:05:59.248 --> 00:06:01.282
Don't you feel
closer already, Kite?

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:04.148
Sure we'll lose life points
but we'll do it together...

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:05.648
like brothers.

00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:25.482
Brother.

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:26.882
Brother!

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:31.548
This can't be.

00:06:31.582 --> 00:06:33.148
Hart...

00:06:33.182 --> 00:06:34.815
Hart, speak to me!

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.148
(Yuma)
What about that window?

00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:45.615
There he is.

00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:47.482
Hart.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.582
C'mon, gimme a sign.

00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:54.648
(coughing)

00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:56.948
He's okay.

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:58.615
Orbital, bring up Kite.

00:06:58.648 --> 00:07:00.048
I gotta share the good news
with him.

00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:04.015
Tell me, Yuma.

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:05.015
Is he all right?

00:07:05.048 --> 00:07:06.715
<i>I think so.</i>

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:08.882
<i>He's still in a deep trance,
but he looks okay to me.</i>

00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:13.448
Yes, Hart is fine.

00:07:13.482 --> 00:07:16.648
But for how much longer
is the question.

00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:19.148
And I would imagine that
you must be asking yourself

00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:21.882
that very same question,
Dr. Faker.

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:23.548
Yes, I think you are.

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:30.448
Vetrix, you leave Hart
out of this duel.

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:34.282
Hart, I wish
you could hear me.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:37.348
So I could tell you how much
you mean to your brother,

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.682
and how badly he wants to be
with you again.

00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:44.715
You there?

00:07:44.748 --> 00:07:46.648
Oh man.
What's this?

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:07.015
Hey, I know
where we are.

00:08:07.048 --> 00:08:08.215
We've been here before.

00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:09.715
Haven't we, Astral?

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:12.448
I do believe
you are right.

00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:14.482
We are inside Hart's
consciousness.

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.648
He summoned us here
not long ago.

00:08:16.682 --> 00:08:17.715
Where is he?

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.182
What is that thing?

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:38.715
(Yuma)
No, is that... Vetrix?

00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:40.715
Why is he here?

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:42.382
A better question.

00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:44.815
Why are you here, Yuma?

00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:46.448
You're in Hart's mind?

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:48.048
So this is an inside job?

00:08:48.082 --> 00:08:49.382
Very good, Yuma!

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:51.615
You discovered my secret.

00:08:51.648 --> 00:08:54.382
Too bad you won't be around
long enough to tell anyone.

00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:01.682
Yuma.
I got this, Astral.

00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:08.482
I summon,
Number 39: Utopia!

00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:24.582
You did it, Uto--
What's happening?

00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:30.082
(Vetrix)
You are finished, Yuma.

00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:38.482
Is that all you got?

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:40.515
'Cause it won't be
enough, Vetrix.

00:09:40.548 --> 00:09:42.615
And I won't stop till
Hart's free of you.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.715
Alright then, now, Utopia.

00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:46.615
Let's keep Hart the way
he was meant to be.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:48.148
Vetrix-free.

00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:52.682
Go Rising Sun Slash.

00:09:57.815 --> 00:10:00.615
(Astral)
Vetrix has been defeated.

00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:02.482
(Vetrix)
Yuma.

00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:07.715
Yuma.

00:10:07.748 --> 00:10:11.215
I'm coming for you.

00:10:11.248 --> 00:10:12.515
(laughing)

00:10:21.548 --> 00:10:22.982
Whoa, Yuma!

00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:31.215
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:10:31.248 --> 00:10:33.782
This is not over!

00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.382
You will regret meddling
in my affairs!

00:10:36.415 --> 00:10:38.115
What did Yuma do?

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:39.515
<i>Kite, good news.</i>

00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:41.482
<i>Hart is no longer
under Vetrix's power.</i>

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.048
<i>You know what that means?</i>

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:45.482
<i>Now you can duel without
worrying about hurting Hart.</i>

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:48.982
<i>So don't hold back or show that
creep any mercy, got it?</i>

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.715
'Cause Vetrix is all yours!

00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:56.115
This means I can release
the full force of my Rage!

00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:57.315
Get ready.

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:03.515
This ends now, Vetrix.

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:14.869
This ends now, Vetrix.

00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:19.536
We're all rootin'
for ya, Master Kite!

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:21.069
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:21.102 --> 00:11:23.036
Show Vetrix what
dueling is all about.

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:24.702
Oh, I intend to.

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:27.302
It's my turn, I draw!

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:30.969
I activate the spell card
Galaxy Expedition.

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:33.202
When Galaxy-Eyes
is on my field,

00:11:33.236 --> 00:11:36.002
I can summon one
Galaxy Knight from my deck.

00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:41.802
Galaxy Knight doesn't like
fighting alone,

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:44.536
so its special ability
lets me summon another one.

00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:49.969
Now I overlay Level 8
Galaxy-Eyes

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:52.669
and my two Galaxy Knights.

00:11:52.702 --> 00:11:55.536
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:11:55.569 --> 00:12:00.402
and Xyz Summon Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon.

00:12:00.436 --> 00:12:03.502
Prepare to witness
the mightiest of monsters.

00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:06.936
With the power of this beast,
this battle is over!

00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:31.902
Oh, not this.

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:34.736
His monster is now
Neo Galaxy-Eyes.

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:36.869
An unexpected nuisance.

00:12:36.902 --> 00:12:38.402
When Galaxy-Eyes is used

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:41.236
as an Overlay Unit
to summon Neo Galaxy-Eyes,

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:43.836
every other monster loses
its special abilities.

00:12:46.902 --> 00:12:49.502
Go Photon Howling!

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:55.536
That means Genom-Heritage's
special ability is cancelled!

00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:56.869
That's right.

00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:59.536
So get ready because
your number is up.

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:00.636
All right.

00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:02.902
Kite can destroy
Genom-Heritage.

00:13:02.936 --> 00:13:04.736
Furthermore,
if Kite is successful,

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:07.036
then he will win the duel.

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.069
(Kite)
Vetrix, there is
no stopping me now.

00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:11.569
I knew I would beat you
in this duel.

00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:14.369
And now I see the moment
is finally at hand.

00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:17.202
Prepare as I strike
the final blow.

00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:20.502
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
attack Genom-Heritage.

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:23.202
Ultimate Photon Stream
of Destruction.

00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:30.836
Yes, ha-ha!

00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:33.036
Master Kite
did it, wonderful!

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:40.702
Ah, that's my boy,
magnificent!

00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:42.569
(maniacal laughing)

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.469
No way.
Ah!

00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:48.136
This can't be.

00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:49.936
(laughing)

00:13:51.702 --> 00:13:54.636
Ever so sorry to disappoint,
but I'm still here.

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.902
How, you ask?

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.302
Just before your attack,

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.869
I activated the trap
Heraldry Protection.

00:14:00.902 --> 00:14:02.402
A trap card.

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:08.502
Yes indeed, Kite.

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:10.036
Due to Heraldry Protection,

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:13.702
I lowered Neo Galaxy-Eyes's
attack points by 800.

00:14:16.202 --> 00:14:18.536
So, it's still your move.

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:22.769
I end my turn.

00:14:24.336 --> 00:14:26.636
Such anger--
keep it coming.

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:27.736
What?

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.636
Your rage is so abundant.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:31.336
I should thank you.

00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:34.936
At this rate I'll have
all I need in no time.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:38.636
All of what?

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.502
Why, anger, of course.

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:46.002
I draw!

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:47.536
And now I summon:

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:49.769
Heraldic Beast
Berners Falcon!

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:56.069
Then I activate the spell
card Heraldry Reborn!

00:14:56.102 --> 00:14:57.836
This card lets me summon

00:14:57.869 --> 00:15:01.969
a Level 4-or-below Heraldic
monster from my graveyard.

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:05.702
So I summon
Heraldic Beast Basilisk.

00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:08.369
But wait, I'm not through.

00:15:08.402 --> 00:15:11.369
Since I have two Heraldic
monsters on my field,

00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:14.869
I can summon Heraldic
Beast Eale from my hand.

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:21.969
And now for the move I've
been building towards.

00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:27.402
I overlay Level 4 Berners
Falcon, Basilisk and Eale.

00:15:27.436 --> 00:15:30.536
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:33.202
and Xyz Summon.

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:36.903
Number 69:
Heraldry Crest!

00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:08.793
(Vetrix)
This duel ends with Number 69:
Heraldry Crest.

00:16:08.827 --> 00:16:11.860
This is an extremely
difficult monster to control.

00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:15.593
To do so you must wield
enormous amounts of anger.

00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:16.593
Anger?

00:16:16.627 --> 00:16:17.860
That's right.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.960
I've been collecting it
from everyone.

00:16:19.993 --> 00:16:22.827
They've all been
unknowingly contributing.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.660
I harnessed Dextra's anger,
and of course Trey's.

00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:30.327
Let's not forget
Quattro and Quinton.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.993
Why, Shark's anger nearly
put me over the top.

00:16:33.027 --> 00:16:34.560
You're mad.

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.827
Oh no,
I'd say you are, Kite.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.327
(laughing)

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.793
It was your boundless rage

00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:43.027
that topped off
my stockpile of anger!

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.493
It is thanks to your fury
over little Hart

00:16:45.527 --> 00:16:47.993
that I was able to
summon Heraldry Crest.

00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:49.960
And before too long

00:16:49.993 --> 00:16:53.260
you'll be wishing you'd never
laid eyes on this monster.

00:16:53.293 --> 00:16:57.493
Heraldry Crest steals your
monster's special abilities!

00:16:57.527 --> 00:16:59.460
(laughing)

00:17:01.027 --> 00:17:02.460
No way.
What?

00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:05.860
Now go Heraldry Crest!

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:09.693
Steal Neo Galaxy-Eyes's
special ability.

00:17:09.727 --> 00:17:10.993
Whipping Lash.

00:17:22.527 --> 00:17:24.427
Your monster will remain
on your field,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.293
though I can't
imagine Galaxy Eyes

00:17:26.327 --> 00:17:28.927
will be much use without
its special ability.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.260
You'll see
how wrong you are.

00:17:31.293 --> 00:17:32.827
Kite.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.693
Wait, you need me!

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.127
Ahh!

00:17:43.293 --> 00:17:46.860
Now to try out my
freshly stolen powers.

00:17:46.893 --> 00:17:50.493
I activate Neo Galaxy-Eyes'
special ability.

00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:52.493
And I'll also use
one Overlay Unit

00:17:52.527 --> 00:17:54.627
to get rid of your monster's
Overlay units.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.927
Heraldry Crest
gains 500 attack points

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.127
for every Overlay Unit that your
monster Neo Galaxy Eyes lost.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.360
So Heraldry Crest
gains 1500 attack points.

00:18:08.393 --> 00:18:09.827
But hold on.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.427
There's a bit more.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.760
Since your monster lost
three Overlay Units,

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:16.660
Heraldry Crest can attack you
three times in a row, Kite.

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:19.393
Now, are you prepared
to handle a triple strike?

00:18:21.027 --> 00:18:22.860
Oh, now don't be upset.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.627
It's not all bad.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.860
Due to the effect of the trap
Heraldry Protection,

00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:29.627
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
won't be destroyed.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.827
No, you will take
all the damage.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.793
Oh, and Faker.

00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:38.493
Crushing your son fills me
with unparalleled joy.

00:18:40.027 --> 00:18:42.593
(laughing)

00:18:42.627 --> 00:18:43.827
Vetrix!

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.760
Now Heraldry Crest.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.827
Attack Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.693
Dark Matter Demolition!

00:19:01.327 --> 00:19:03.027
Finish him,
Heraldry Crest,

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.027
and make sure he never
forgets this defeat!

00:19:09.527 --> 00:19:10.827
(audience)
Ohh!

00:19:17.127 --> 00:19:18.527
Kite, nooooo...

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.293
Brother.

00:19:25.327 --> 00:19:27.360
You are beaten!

00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:28.960
But since my monster
and I are having

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.460
such a good time attacking you,
I'll do it again.

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:32.760
Why stop the fun now?

00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:34.960
Dark Matter Demolition!

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:36.660
Hang in there, Kite!

00:19:50.327 --> 00:19:51.960
What is happening?

00:19:57.327 --> 00:19:59.760
No, it can't be.

00:19:59.793 --> 00:20:00.827
It's Hart.

00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:07.360
Thank you, Hart.

00:20:08.793 --> 00:20:10.460
Oh no.

00:20:10.493 --> 00:20:11.793
Thank you, brother.

00:20:30.193 --> 00:20:31.527
Aww, how touching.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.960
Hart showed up just in time

00:20:32.993 --> 00:20:34.927
to soften his
brother's final blow.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.027
I'd be moved to tears
if I were capable of it.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.727
But I'm not.

00:20:43.393 --> 00:20:44.927
This duel is mine.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.193
As are your soul
and Number cards.

00:20:55.227 --> 00:20:57.327
Kite!

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.827
Speak to me,
c'mon, wake up.

00:21:06.393 --> 00:21:09.864
Kite, no!
