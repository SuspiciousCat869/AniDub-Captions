00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.430
Female reporter A: we're here at
the city shopping center where

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.330
an unknown individual has
blockaded all the access

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.560
points to the top floor.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.690
we understand that.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.030
Litterbot: Trash identified,
trash ident

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.860
CRIMINAL: Now you're trash!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.960
Dumb litterbot!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.160
Don't forget to recycle.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.130
Yuma: Hey, watch it up there!

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.530
For the last time make good on
my demands or

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.730
the hostages are gonna get it!

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.490
Criminal I warnin' ya,
I mean business!

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130
The clock's ticking!

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.290
and so the stand off continues

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.430
It's uncertain if authorities
are planning to meet his

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.660
demands of money and a
helicopter - We will see.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.690
Oh man!

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660
Not good!

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.230
KARI: Yuma!

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.090
You're at the shopping mall
right now, aren't you?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.290
Are you saying I'm goofing off
at the mall instead

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.690
of doing my homework?

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.830
How dare you!

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.830
Tori: You are.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.890
Zip it!

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.330
tori's right!

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And do you know how I
know she's right?

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.890
Cuz I'm watching you
right now live on tv!

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.530
Busted.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.990
Now go find out what's going on
so I get a scoop!

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.830
People say it's tough
being a reporter.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.860
Well they should try
being a brother.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.490
They help in this investigation.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.160
Quit stalling me or
you'll be sorry!

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.560
Who is this guy?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.860
Astral: Look, there.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.760
It is a number.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.660
So this bandit's has
a number card!

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.830
I need a closer look!

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.860
Comin' through.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.890
Wait!

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.090
Kite: Number confirmed.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.290
Time to spread our wings.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.090
Orbital 7: You got it, boss!

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.230
Let the hunt begin!

Oh yes - I'm always serious when
it comes to hunting numbers.

Well then come and get it.

I do not possess.

the number, Kite?

soon bring peace there.

is it you have now?

Orbital?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.990

possession.

So many in such a short time!

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.230
I knew that I picked the
right man for the job!

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.560
What's wrong, Kite?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.390
Now, now.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.530

all the souls that

you've been capturing

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.990
as you well know, when we take a
number, there's no way to avoid

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.630
taking a bit of that number
keeper's life force, too.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.260
But what's a few
extra gray hairs?!

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.390
after all, everyone ages.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.560
We're just speeding
up the process.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.260
And these number keeper's have
it coming, too.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.030
They're a villainous lot and
should be shown no mercy!

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.660
Just promise me when all of the
numbers cards are ours

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.130
my brother will be okay.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.760
But of course!

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.030
As I've told you time and time
again, once all the

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.730
numbers are gathered, your
brother will be cured.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.990
I assure you of this!

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.490
You must believe me, Kite.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.760
Your brother's well being means
just as much to me

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.590
as it does to you!

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.690
Okay.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.690
Keep up the good work and happy
number hunting, Kite!

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.430
Remember - The quicker
you fetch them!

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.390
The sooner we can
cure your brother!

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.060
Ah, dr. Faker!

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.430
Dr. Faker: Tell me, what is the
latest in our undertaking?

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.230
Well, the latest is that
everything is

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.030
going just as planned.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.730
And what a fine plan it is.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.260
What is it they say -
one man's trash

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.630
is another man's treasure?

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.690
Well, it's True and with that
treasure we will do

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.590
what we must to
protect our future

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.060
just as I protected Kite and his
brother before

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.090
Yes.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.460
Quite right, dr. Faker

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.330
let the people of astral
world try to stop me.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.760
Let them send an envoy

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.430
oh yes, I know he's here.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.390
I knew the very
minute he arrived

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.260
but mark my words, his
visit will be short!

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.760
I'll send him back to the
pathetic little

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.130
planet he calls home

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.190
he'll go back as
a broken, beaten soul!

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.720
Yes.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.530
Female reporter B: so as you can
see by the footage from today's

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.560
earlier incident at
the mall - It seems a

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.290
young boy was somehow involved

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.330
we have since learned that this
young boy was released but

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.130
you were supposed to get me the
scoop not be the scoop!

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.130
Tori: I don't understand how
yuma got mixed up in

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.330
all of this in the first place.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.760
What happened, yuma?

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.790
Oh, I don't know, I guess I was
just in the wrong place

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.960
and the right time

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.990
Oh.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.290
Yuma.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.560
Are you not going to tell them
about the number Hunter?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.430
No way - My sis hates it when I
get mixed up in dueling drama!

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.730
If she finds out I'm in big...

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.630
what?

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.690
Nothing.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.860
Nothing at all!

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.430
Are you mixed up in
some dueling drama?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.690
Of course not, Kari, why would
you ever think that?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.760
I wonder what this all means

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.660
GIRL: Really, for me?

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.260
Hey, Kite.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Hey Hart, you ready to
check out the fair?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.230
Don't think so.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.990
Come on.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.430
They got games and balloons down
there, you love that stuff

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.160
I don't remember liking games or
balloons.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.430
In fact, I don't remember liking
much of anything.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.230
Why can't I remember Kite?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.560
Did something happen?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.090
Is there something
wrong with me?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.890
Hart, you...

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.990
Kite

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.460
I don't think I
ever liked anything.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.830
Hart

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.460
you're wrong about that, and I'm
going to prove it to you.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.630
You promise?

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.630
Yeah, I promise...

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.630
Yuma...

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.090
Yeah, what's up?

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.030
What is up is someone other than
you and I are gathering numbers

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.690
and that is troubling.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.060
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.490
You do realize that eventually
This Hunter will

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.090
come looking for us.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.330
In fact, it is more
than likely that he is

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.090
looking for us as we speak.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.730
We need some sort of plan, yuma.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.390
Hey, I've gotta
plan for us, astral!

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.990
Let's not wait for this Hunter
to hunt us down,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.430
let's go hunt them!

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.060
Whadaya think?

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.060
I think this is a bad idea.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.330
For real, bronk?

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.290
Bronk: You bet, it's a
bit outta the way but a

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.430
great place for pick up duels!

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.560
Sweet!

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.360
I duel anyone,
anywhere and anytime!

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.490
Wanna join us?

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.490
Come on,Tori?!

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.030
it'll be fun!

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.060
Um, alright, but
you're buyin' lunch!

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.260
Aw, man,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.690
bronk was right, that was tons
of dueling fun!

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.990
And did you see
how great I played?

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.530
I was so on!

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.560
Really, do you always lose all
your matches when you're 'on'?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.230
not 'all'!

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.260
just some.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Or most.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.730
Or, okay, all of
them but so what?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.290
It's not like anyone's keeping
track - Then again,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.360
I guess you were

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.430
yuma.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.490
I sense that danger is near.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.990
Do you feel it as well?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.990
No

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.360
but thanks for freaking me out.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.790
What's wrong, yuma?

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.890
Uh

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.930
I'm sure it's nothing.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.030
Uh oh.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.390
Oh no, my hair!

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.760
Let's get outta the rain.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.590
Wait up!

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.260
Come on, Tori!

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.060
I'm moving as fast as I-

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.460
Tori!

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.530
Yuma, yuma!

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.430
What's the deal?

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.760
Tori!

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.160
What's going on here?

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.590
It's just like the mall,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.530
that whistling

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.760
he's here!

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.760
Hey - I'm getting's sick a'this?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.660
Why do you keep Freezing
everything?!

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.690
things aren't exactly frozen.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.430
Time's simply moving at
1/10,000th of its normal

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.690
speed and do you know why?

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.760
Because it's a special duel
field I created!

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.760
Quite special, only people
with numbers can move

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.290
freely in this field.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.360
You see, that's how I
know you have a number.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.990
We should leave this place now.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.430
But I'm not scared of him!

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.490
Yuma!

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.560
Get out of here!

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560
Run, quick!

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.730
Aw, I can take this guy!

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.030
Ah!

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.660
Whoa.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.060
I'm not going anywhere.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.430
That's right - From here on out,
you're stuck on this field!

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.730
We can't separate!

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.430
Great.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.160
Yes, it is great because
now you have no choice.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.990
Now, you and I will
duel for numbers!

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.630
Well get set to get decked!

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.130
You're going down number Hunter!

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.630
Good attitude, yuma.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.690
We must be fearless.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.090
Fearless?!

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.760
you were the guy who was just
telling me to run away!

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.690
That is when I thought you could
run away, yuma.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.630
Thanks for the confidence boost.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.690
Get ready, yuma, this duel we
are about to have

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.190
is not just for fun and games.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.090
The stakes have
never been higher.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.260
Hey, I'm at my best under
pressure, so let's

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.230
cut the chitchat and duel!

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.630
Aw Yeah, now this is
what I'm talking about!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.530
I am feeling the flow!

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.630
Oh Yeah?

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.260
Well, you're about
to feel the pain!

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.560
Whoa!

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.090
What's happenin'?

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.760
go photon transformation!

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.430
Computer VOICE: augmented
reality Vision

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.530
link established.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.990
There is no escape
now my little friend

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.730
you and your number
will be hunted down.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.730
Both: Now let's duel!

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.030
Allow me to go first, won't you?

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.990
I draw!

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.060
First I activate the spell card
Photon veil from my hand!

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.990
With this card, by returning
three Light attribute monsters

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.690
from my hand to my deck,
I can then add THREE

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.960
light attribute monsters
from my deck

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.090
to my hand.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.730
So he gets to pick
the monsters he wants?

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.160
Next, I'm gonna activate the
power of the spell card

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.290
photon lead which lets me summon
one of the monsters I

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.730
just added to my
hand in attack mode!

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.990
And the monster I summon
is daybreaker!

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.060
But there's more - When this
card is successfully summoned,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.590
I can summon another
one from my hand!

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.030
So that's two daybreakers!

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.630
And now the second
one's ability activates!

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.560
So welcome to the field
daybreaker number three!

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.460
Three Monsters just like that?!

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.690
oh no

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.690
and each one of them
share the same level of 4!

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.130
Aw,just great.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.990
I overlay my three
Level 4 daybreakers to

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.730
build the overlay network!

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.160
I xyz summon, number 10:
Illumiknight!

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.130
Oh my.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.130
No way - He brought out a number
on his very first turn!

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.290
That's right,

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.690
and guess what, I'm still not
done because now

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.990
I play illumiknight's ability!

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.530
With it, once per turn, I can
use an overlay unit to discard

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.560
one card from my hand to draw
one New Card from my deck!

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.260
Then lightserpent's special
ability activates!

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.730
You see, when lightserpent is
sent to the graveyard from my

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.560
hand - It's then
summoned to the field!

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:44.960
Next I'll bring out
the monster plasma ball!

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.990
You kiddin' me?

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.730
Three monsters again!

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.760
This guy really oughta pace
himself out - It's

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.490
gonna be a long duel.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.630
I fear,

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.060
not at this rate.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.530
I now overlay light
serpent and plasma ball!

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.760
And with that I can once again
build the overlay network!

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.430
I xyz summon - Number 20!

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.630
Giga-Brilliant!

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.690
Oh boy.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.390
He summoned two numbers
in just one turn

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.430
now

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.630
the hunt truly begins.
