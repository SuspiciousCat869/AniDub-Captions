WEBVTT

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.651
(Kari)
Yuma! Hey, Yuma!

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:05.319
You better come down
pronto or I'm calling Bronk

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.722
to munch on all your lunch.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.791
Yuma!

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.292
I know you can hear me.

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:12.860
Even Grandma can hear me

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.862
Hey, Kari, is Yuma
still in his room?

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:17.465
Mm-hmm.

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:18.866
I've tried to get him down all
day, but he's not budging.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.936
Even food threats
aren't working.

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:24.372
He's still upset.

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:25.773
Poor guy.

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:32.346
(Yuma) Astral!

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:36.048
(Astral) Goodbye, my friend.

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:40.252
Astral!

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:42.554
Astral.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.258
(Don Thousand)
Welcome to my
sacred domain.

00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:49.261
(Vector) Don Thousand.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.962
This palace is truly befitting
of your great and limitless

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.032
power.

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.267
(Don Thousand)
Few mortals have
ever gained entry.

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:58.070
You should consider
this a great honor.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.207
I do, in fact, I'm not even
sure I'm worthy to be here.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.912
Wait.

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:08.213
Is that what I think it is?

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.516
Number 96.

00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:14.920
(Don Thousand) Correct.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.521
Astral was unable to
destroy all his power.

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.258
So naturally, what was left
returned to its rightful owner.

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:25.130
Are you implying
that that's you?

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.265
How could that be?

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.634
Because, Vector, Number 96
was originally a part of me.

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:34.940
A part of you?

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.108
(Don Thousand) Yes.

00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:37.542
When I battled with Astral, I
attacked with such fury that

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.079
a splinter of my dark power
buried itself within his heart.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.517
Of course!

00:01:45.517 --> 00:01:46.952
I wondered how someone like
Astral could have such a vile

00:01:46.952 --> 00:01:49.254
being inside him.

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:51.056
Uh, no offense.

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:53.258
(Don Thousand)
Here, taste the dark
power that created 96!

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:58.063
It's unbelievable!

(Don Thousand)
Taste the dark power
that created 96!

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:10.635
(Vector) It's unbelievable!

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:15.240
What have you done to me?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.509
(Don Thousand)
Turned you into my
ultimate warrior.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.845
I can feel your power
coursing through me.

00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:24.716
With this power,
I will crush Yuma Tsukumo!

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:35.260
(Don Thousand)
You must learn
patience, Vector.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.029
It is not yet time.

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.266
What kind of game is Don
Thousand playing with me?

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.103
(Don Thousand)
You will crush Yuma one day,
but first, there is another task

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:49.941
to be done, one of
great importance.

00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.745
Sounds very exciting.

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:55.680
(Don Thousand) Behold!

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.689
(Vector)
It looks impressive,
but what is it?

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.659
(Don Thousand)
This Fusionizer will make it
possible to combine Barian World

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.630
with the human world!

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.832
Joining them together!

00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:16.268
Is that really possible?

00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:19.271
(Don Thousand)
Doubt me again, Vector, and you
shall suffer the consequences!

00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:23.775
Is that understood?

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:26.011
All right, I believe you.

00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:27.646
And I think it's
fiendishly brilliant.

00:04:27.646 --> 00:04:29.581
But what's the purpose
of fusing the two worlds?

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:32.784
For power!

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:34.252
Much more power!

00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:36.988
Destroying Astral World requires
a great amount of energy.

00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:41.826
And by tapping into the human
world, I will gain that energy.

00:04:45.563 --> 00:04:49.067
Vector, execute my plan.

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:52.003
Sit upon my throne and see
to it that everything goes

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.674
as designed.

00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:57.842
To assist you, I am
giving you four unique

00:04:57.842 --> 00:05:01.046
and powerful Numbers.

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:03.281
They will help you spread
turmoil and suffering across

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.251
the human world.

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.687
Wield these Numbers viciously.

00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:11.189
Use their power to throw the
human world into complete

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.826
and utter chaos.

00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:16.861
Failure is not an option!

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:38.683
Astral, I can't believe
you're really gone.

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:47.258
I wish I had never started
dueling or ever heard

00:05:47.258 --> 00:05:50.261
of Number cards.

00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.597
'Cause if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't feel so angry

00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:56.267
and upset!

00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:57.802
I don't want these.

00:05:57.802 --> 00:05:58.970
They're nothin' but trouble!

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.872
(Astral) Yuma...

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:03.708
Take care of the Numbers.

00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:10.048
I don't want to
let Astral down.

00:06:10.048 --> 00:06:12.617
But I'm just not sure if I have
what it takes to keep them safe.

00:06:21.593 --> 00:06:24.996
Hey there, Shark.

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:31.002
Here.

00:06:31.002 --> 00:06:32.070
I got them for Rio.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.072
Great, thanks.

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:35.140
Put them on the table.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.274
Sure.

00:06:36.274 --> 00:06:38.676
I asked Yuma to come, but ever
since Astral disappeared,

00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:43.648
he refuses to leave his room.

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:45.917
I've never seen
him so down before.

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:48.219
Sorry, Tori, but
Yuma's problems are

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:50.255
the last thing on
my mind right now.

00:06:50.488 --> 00:06:52.957
Oh, of course, Shark.

00:06:52.957 --> 00:06:54.793
I know you've got
a lot on your plate.

00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:57.195
Poor Rio.

00:06:57.195 --> 00:06:59.531
She's gonna be ok, Shark.

00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:01.032
I just know it.

00:07:01.032 --> 00:07:02.901
I'll be right
outside if you need me.

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.270
I just can't face Yuma.

00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:07.272
Not till I know
the truth about myself.

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:10.208
Am I really a Barian?

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:17.949
I heard you needed me so I flew
here as fast as I could.

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.852
What's the latest buzz, buddy?

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:23.555
The buzz is you're late.

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:25.690
Uh, sorry about that.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.926
I couldn't find my glasses.

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:28.927
But I'm glad I did!

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.261
I like the new look.

00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:31.963
Change is good.

00:07:31.963 --> 00:07:34.065
And speaking of change,
I think it's time you had one.

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.136
Looking snazzy, Heartland.

00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:41.639
You just need one final
accessory to complete

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.275
your ensemble.

00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:46.277
Amazing.

00:07:46.277 --> 00:07:47.946
My very own Number.

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:50.281
I'm honored you've given
such an important card to me.

00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:53.751
Stop at nothing to seize
Yuma Tsukumo's Numbers.

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:57.722
I'll even give you an evil
entourage as backup.

00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:00.758
No, it can't be.

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.261
Long time no see.

00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:06.498
At last, the team that put the
"fear" in fearsome is reuniting

00:08:06.498 --> 00:08:10.168
to spread dread and
mayhem wherever we go.

00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:12.770
Erazor!

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.673
You won't regret what
you've done for me, Vector.

00:08:15.673 --> 00:08:18.276
I promise I won't let you down.

00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:25.817
I'm going to eat
everything here!

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:27.252
This tastes fantastic!

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:28.720
(Caswell)
This satisfies
the duelist in me.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.255
(Flip) Hey, pass the Duel Fuel.

00:08:30.255 --> 00:08:31.556
(Caswell)
Seconds and thirds, please.

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:33.124
Delish!

00:08:33.124 --> 00:08:34.826
You guys have to try my
homemade chicken a la Tori.

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:37.262
It's out of this world.

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:38.963
But it's not as
yummy as my rice dish.

00:08:38.963 --> 00:08:40.832
I used cat food to
give it extra flavor.

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:43.268
(Bronk) Check it.

00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:44.669
It's a nifty new badge I
designed for our Super Secret

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:47.272
Number Card Investigation Club.

00:08:47.272 --> 00:08:49.274
I made one for each of you.

00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:52.710
That's not bad, Bronk, but set
your sights on these super rare,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.281
mega powerful cards
I picked up for us downtown.

00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.018
Yeah, well, I bought you guys
a bunch of tickets for the new

00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:02.253
Kuriboh Coaster that's
guaranteed to make you lose

00:09:02.487 --> 00:09:04.856
your lunch.

00:09:10.662 --> 00:09:14.165
It isn't working, guys.

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:15.733
He's not coming down.

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:17.268
Oh, Yuma.

00:09:17.268 --> 00:09:19.604
He can't get over the
fact that Astral's gone.

00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:22.140
And I know just how he feels.

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:44.062
Game over.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.237
I know it's
disappointing to lose.

00:09:53.237 --> 00:09:55.707
How 'bout I help you
forget all about it?

00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:05.249
"In a series of
strange occurrences,

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:06.985
duelists have been
losing their memories.

00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:09.253
Several have been found
unconscious near the

00:10:09.487 --> 00:10:11.556
Heartland Memorial Hall."

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:13.224
Now that's freaky.

00:10:13.224 --> 00:10:14.726
"Once awake, they have what
appears to be total amnesia."

00:10:14.726 --> 00:10:18.062
Now who could be doing this?

00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:20.932
So, the rumors are true.

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:25.870
Astral has vanished from the
human world, which means the

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.007
Barians will attack with
even greater ferocity.

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:32.276
It's time for us
to sweep into action.

00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:35.179
Your job will be to
look after Yuma.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.549
Yes, brother.

00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:47.158
(Bronk) Guys, listen to this.

00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:48.993
A bunch of duelists got
their memories wiped out.

00:10:48.993 --> 00:10:51.896
(Flip)
Messing with minds is
a Barian specialty.

00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:54.699
If you ask me, The Super Secret
Number Card Investigation Club

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:57.802
should get to the
bottom of this mystery.

00:10:57.802 --> 00:10:59.937
You know, that could be the
perfect way to get Yuma

00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:01.773
out of his funk.

00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:03.174
When he finds out, he'll
want to get in on the action.

00:11:03.174 --> 00:11:06.277
Then let's go solve The
Mystery of Lost Memories!

00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:09.547
We'll have Yuma
defunked in no time.

00:11:09.547 --> 00:11:11.916
(all) All right!

00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:20.258
Erazor! Exactly what
are you up to?

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:22.493
I don't know what
you mean, Heartland.

00:11:22.493 --> 00:11:24.262
Don't play innocent!

00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:25.963
We were ordered to capture
Yuma Tsukumo's Numbers.

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:29.233
Okay, you got me.

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:31.035
I was just using those duelists
to warm up for the main event.

00:11:31.035 --> 00:11:34.272
And to feast on their
memories, of course.

00:11:34.272 --> 00:11:36.774
I have a special
yen for losers' minds.

00:11:36.774 --> 00:11:39.277
The anguish they feel after a
humiliating defeat is so delish.

00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:51.189
Hey, I've seen
that girl before.

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:53.591
She's friends with
Yuma Tsukumo.

00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:56.127
I betcha her memories will
be incredibly helpful

00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:59.030
and delicious.

00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:06.270
In the end, this is the best
spot to begin our investigation.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.941
The news said that several
duelists were found unconscious

00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:13.044
right around here.

00:12:13.044 --> 00:12:14.579
Be ready to pounce.

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:16.013
Eyes open, people.

00:12:16.013 --> 00:12:17.281
'Cause you never know where
a Barian might pop up.

00:12:17.482 --> 00:12:19.784
Bring him on.

00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:21.018
If he tries to steal my
memories, I'll give him

00:12:21.018 --> 00:12:22.754
something he won't forget.

00:12:22.754 --> 00:12:25.656
Huh?

00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:27.258
I think you're looking for me.

00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:45.676
<i>Hey! Rise and shine!</i>

00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:49.280
Heartland!

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.815
<i>I just knew you'd be</i>
thrilled to see that I'm back.

00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:53.251
I thought you
were gone for good!

00:12:53.484 --> 00:12:55.553
<i>When I fell into that</i>
inter-dimensional vortex,

00:12:55.553 --> 00:12:58.089
<i>I thought I was a goner, too.</i>

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.957
<i>But thankfully,</i>
I was revived by Vector.

00:12:59.957 --> 00:13:02.260
Vector?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.262
<i>Yes and just as Vector helped</i>
me, these mopey malcontents...

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:08.065
or "friends" as you call them... have
been trying to help you.

00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:17.275
Glad to see you're out.

00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:19.277
<i>(Heartland)Your chums were trying to</i>
drawnyou out of your room by playing

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.280
<i>amateur detectives.</i>

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.881
<i>They didn't realize their</i>
investigation would lead them

00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:26.083
<i>straight into</i>
the hands of the bad guy.

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:28.252
<i>And now only you can save</i>
their skins or to be exact,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.223
<i>their minds.</i>

00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:34.058
<i>If you want to save 'em, bring</i>
your Numbers to the Heartland

00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:36.260
<i>Memorial Hall on the double!</i>

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.262
<i>But hurry, there's</i>
not much time.

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:40.665
Don't worry, you guys!

00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:41.999
I'm on my way.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.035
(Heartland) Yuma Tsukumo.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.271
Thanks for coming.

00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:49.841
Heartland! What have you done
with Tori and the others?

00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:52.777
They're taking a time out.

00:13:52.777 --> 00:13:55.279
Flip! Tori!

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.581
Caswell! Somebody
answer me!

00:13:57.882 --> 00:13:59.817
What did you do
to them, Heartland?

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:03.888
He didn't do a thing,
I deserve all the credit.

00:14:04.222 --> 00:14:07.925
I was feeling
some hunger pangs,

00:14:07.925 --> 00:14:09.560
so I feasted on your
buddies' memories.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.863
Who are you?
I'm Erazor.

00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:15.132
You'll have to battle me if
you want to get your friends'

00:14:15.132 --> 00:14:16.968
memories back.

00:14:16.968 --> 00:14:18.269
But if you lose,
I get your Numbers.

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:21.672
Of course, I have no doubt that
I'll crush you completely.

00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:25.109
I look forward to watching you
crumble to your knees once you

00:14:25.109 --> 00:14:27.612
realize you not only
lost all your Numbers,

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:30.281
but failed your
friends as well!

00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:32.950
(Yuma)
If I agree to duel him,
I'll risk all the Numbers

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.219
I've gathered.

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:36.621
But if I turn him down, Tori and
the others will never get their

00:14:36.621 --> 00:14:39.724
memories back.

00:14:39.724 --> 00:14:41.259
There's a lot
riding on this duel.

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.160
What if I can't hack it?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.795
After all,
I'll be dueling alone.

00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:48.266
Astral, I'm not sure I can beat
this guy without you here.

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:54.772
So, we dueling?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.041
Give him a break, Erazor.

00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.979
You shouldn't put so much
pressure on Yuma.

00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:04.849
After all, this isn't
really his fight.

00:15:04.849 --> 00:15:07.251
The battle for the
Numbers is between

00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:08.920
the Barians and Astral World.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.022
It doesn't concern humans.

00:15:11.022 --> 00:15:13.090
Why should this poor kid
be forced to take sides?

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.260
Now that Astral is gone,
there's no reason for you

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.597
to worry about the fate of
the Numbers, is there, Yuma?

00:15:19.597 --> 00:15:22.967
I guess not.

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:24.769
Let me make this
easy for you, my friend.

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:27.271
Just hand over your Numbers and
I promise the Barians will never

00:15:27.505 --> 00:15:30.207
bother you or your
friends again.

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:32.643
Your friends' memories will
be restored, of course.

00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:35.079
Promise!

00:15:35.079 --> 00:15:36.681
And if you'd like, I can also
arrange to have your memories

00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:39.250
of Astral completely erased.

00:15:40.952 --> 00:15:42.954
Some memories are simply
too painful to bear.

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:48.059
Just think of how
pleasant your life would

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:50.061
be if you could forget him.

00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:52.730
All the sadness you feel
over Astral's loss will

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.266
be instantly wiped away.

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:57.902
It will be as if he
never even existed.

00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:02.139
As if Astral never existed?

00:16:07.278 --> 00:16:10.748
I won't do it!

00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:14.251
Every memory I have of
Astral is important to me.

00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:16.253
The good ones and
even the bad ones.

00:16:16.253 --> 00:16:19.256
The Numbers are more than just
cards to me, because in some

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:21.859
way, they hold all the
adventures and battles

00:16:21.859 --> 00:16:24.261
I shared with him.

00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:25.830
Astral trusted me to hold onto
the Numbers and keep them safe.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.866
And I'm not letting him down!

00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:32.269
That's why I would never turn
the Numbers over to you!

00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:36.173
(Trey) Way to tell 'em, Yuma!

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.250
It's Trey!

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.341
Trey!

00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:51.576
What're you doing here?

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:53.344
Simple.

00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:55.505
I saw you were in
trouble and came to help.

00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:57.640
Now that Astral is gone,
it's clear you're going

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.242
to need some backup.

00:16:59.242 --> 00:17:00.944
Anyone who tries to harm you,

00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:02.245
will have to get
past yours truly.

00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:05.115
How did you know about Astral?

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.650
My brothers and I have been
following the conflict between

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.086
Astral World and Barian
World closely.

00:17:10.086 --> 00:17:12.789
That's how we learned
about Astral's fate.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:15.125
I'm sorry, Yuma.

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:16.893
Losing a friend is never easy.

00:17:17.227 --> 00:17:19.829
Listen, I know you feel sad and
alone right now, but remember

00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:25.068
you have friends like me
who will stand beside you.

00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:28.238
You're right, I'm not alone.

00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:31.875
What feeble adversaries.

00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.777
Now we're up against two runts.

00:17:33.777 --> 00:17:35.879
Two runts who won't have
any trouble defeating you,

00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:38.114
Heartland!
Really?

00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:40.116
Then let's see how you
handle my Stinging Swarm!

00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:51.227
What?

00:17:51.795 --> 00:17:53.596
I thought the crest's
power was gone forever.

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:58.735
Well you thought
wrong Heartland.

00:17:58.735 --> 00:18:00.503
Quinton discovered a way to
preserve the power my father

00:18:00.503 --> 00:18:03.239
shared with us, which
I can now use to help Yuma.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.044
Whoa, you're gonna
help me Trey?

00:18:08.044 --> 00:18:09.779
Thanks, pal.

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:10.980
I know that no one
can replace Astral,

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.749
but I'll give it my best shot.

00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:14.651
Before when we dueled, you
and I faced off as opponents.

00:18:14.651 --> 00:18:17.520
We used our cards and all
the power we had to try

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.023
and out-duel
each other.

00:18:20.023 --> 00:18:21.858
But now that we're teaming up,
I'll share my power with you.

00:18:21.858 --> 00:18:25.762
He's putting it all
on the line to help me.

00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:29.732
Take care of the Numbers.

00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:38.241
Trey, take these.
My Number Cards!

00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:43.246
Astral trusted me to take care
of the Numbers, which means he

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:45.949
also trusted that I would
know what's best for 'em.

00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:49.252
You're using your
power to help me,

00:18:49.252 --> 00:18:51.254
so I want to share
what I have with you.

00:18:51.488 --> 00:18:54.524
Thank you.

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:58.161
If Astral were here I'm
sure he'd agree with me.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.833
It feels like the
right thing to do.

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:06.503
Sounds to me like you twerps are
gonna try and put up a fight!

00:19:07.237 --> 00:19:11.074
Bad choice, but
I won't stop you.

00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:14.477
Ready?

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:18.047
If you like, I'll take
you both on at once.

00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:20.250
Yuma and I could both beat you
on our own, but if you insist...

00:19:20.483 --> 00:19:23.820
Then we'll duel you together!

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:32.095
Duel Disk, go!

00:19:36.232 --> 00:19:39.802
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:43.173
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.

00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:47.911
(all) Let's duel!

00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:49.946
Not so fast.

00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:52.549
Before we get things started, I
insist on snazzing up the place.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.719
My fellow creepy crawlies
will give this hall

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.123
a Barian makeover.

00:20:00.123 --> 00:20:02.892
What's with the light show?

00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:04.227
Now that you're dueling on enemy
ground, Erazor's got the upper

00:20:04.227 --> 00:20:07.497
hand, especially since I gave
him the power to absorb half

00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:10.800
of your life points.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.835
You can't do that!

00:20:12.835 --> 00:20:14.237
Oh, really?
Just you watch me.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.023
I don't like this, Trey.

00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:36.693
Me either.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:37.894
This is totally bugging me out.
