WEBVTT

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.130
Kite: Hey Hart!

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.660
You there?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.460
Why aren't you answering me?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.630
He's gone.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.260
Where's Hart?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.030
Tell me right now!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.990
Guard: We're
conducting a search.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.630
Dextra and nistro are
trying to retrie...

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.030
Have you two found Hart yet?

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.190
Well?

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.730
Have you?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.760
Nistro: I told the control team
to keep this mission quiet!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.660
So how did Kite find out?

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.930
Dextra!

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.160
Nistro, come in!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.690
Do you read me?

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.490
Why aren't you answering?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.460
Because you're
annoying, that's why!

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.860
Dextra: Don't cut him off yet.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.290
Calm down, Kite.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.360
We can confirm that
your brother is safe.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.730
But dextra!

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.060
Listen.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.430
We're supposed
to bring Hart back.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.330
And it won't be easy.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.260
We'll need your help, Kite.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.060
You brother was detected on the
roof of the windmill tower

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.030
located in the bay area.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.490
He's with a boy
named yuma tsukumo.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.030
Are you kidding?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.530
We're supposed
to handle this!

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.060
Why bring in Kite?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.160
Because we can't
do this without him.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.360
Hart is too powerful
in his current state.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.190
Last time we tried to nab him
the results were explosive.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.990
Kite is the only person I know

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.160
who that boy will
trust right now.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.890
I believe Hart will listen to
Kite and obey what he says.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.530
Why is Hart at that tower?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.790
Here.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.660
It's caramel.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.430
It's a tasty magical power-up.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
It can give you strength.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.630
Hart: It's sweet!

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.060
It's really sweet!

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.530
I feel energetic.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.260
That's good.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.790
I will always protect you.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.490
Stop it!

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.330
Let me go, you...

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.430
Hart!

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.430
Let him go!

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.230
He must have been drawn to that
place. But why go with yuma?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.630
I want answers and I'll stop
at nothing to get them!

YUMA: Well, that was
certainly a weird goodbye.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.230
Quinton: I'm Hart's friend.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.590
I'm here to help.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.860
Isn't that right, Hart?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.530
But Hart did seem to know the
guy, so I guess it'll be okay.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.790
Tori: He'll be fine.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.330
I guess Kite was too busy to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.890
pick Hart up so
he sent a friend.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.490
Maybe...

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.760
but I feel like I don't
understand anything about Hart.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.530
Kite once told me he hunts
for numbers to help his little

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.530
brother, but why?

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.990
My mission is to
destroy astral world.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.430
astral: Could it be True?

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.260
Who is it now?

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.860
Isn't that the chopper
that took Hart away?

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.560
It's you again.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.690
Okay kid, where is Hart?

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.190
What do ya mean?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.190
Your guys took him
away a few minutes ago!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.630
Who took him?

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.990
Somebody with a
chopper just like yours!

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.030
Aren't you guys all
working for the same team?

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.090
The chopper that picked up Hart
had a symbol like that, too!

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.230
Did you hear that, dextra?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.830
Yuma.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.190
Yeah.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.290
I don't believe a
word that he says.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.490
We're the only ones
looking for Hart.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.560
Stop lying to us or else...

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.230
what have you done with Hart?

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.790
Leave him alone!

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.230
Put me down, nistro!

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.590
Can it, kid!

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.530
Don't forget we're on the duel
carnival's organizing committee.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.630
All it takes is one word from us

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.230
and you'll be booted
out of the competition.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.960
I know.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.030
Then we want a
straight answer from you.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.330
What have you done with Hart?

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.490
Hey!

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.730
What's that?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.890
Orbital 7: Nice landing, sir.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.160
Alright. Tell me Hart is!

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.830
Is my brother okay?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.430
Well?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.590
Kite, I tried to tell them, But
they think I'm hiding Hart So

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.360
they won't listen
to anything I say.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.330
Are you hiding him, yuma?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.830
No way!

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.530
The guy you sent came in a
chopper to pick up your brother.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.060
I didn't send
anyone to pick him up.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.790
Then he wasn't your friend?

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.160
Brother...

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.590
If Kite didn't send
that guy to pick up Hart,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.030
then where did he come from?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.730
Stop trying to fool us!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.790
We weren't manufactured
yesterday, you know.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.290
Be quiet.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.290
I'm just saying, master Kite.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.790
Describe the person
who picked up Hart.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.230
Tell me everything.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.390
You said "Guy."

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.660
I assume the
person was male?

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.890
Yeah of course!

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.330
What did he look like?

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.660
He seemed pretty young.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.790
I think about twenty years old.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.390
He was tall.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.160
Approximate height
6 feet one inch.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.030
Weight, 150 pounds.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.860
Yeah right, the guy was about
six-one and weighed one-fifty!

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.090
He had long hair and his
eyes were the color blue.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.560
He had long hair, and his eyes,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.630
what color did you
say they were again?

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.390
You're askin' for it, twerp!

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.130
Stop it, nistro!

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.660
Or what?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.160
I don't take orders from you!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.590
Nistro!

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.460
But dextra, this
kid is makin' up

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.090
enough junk to
fill a garbage dump!

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.630
It is hard to believe,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.630
but it seems clear that someone
outside of our team came here

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.660
and took Hart away.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.160
Let's go, nistro.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
There's nothing
more we can do for now.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.260
Alright then.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.860
You okay?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.530
This whole mission
was a big waste of time.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.430
It's my fault.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.460
I shouldn't have let Hart go.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.560
I'm sorry.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.990
Hart isn't well.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.190
I hope I find him soon.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.460
Hart's sick?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.790
Kite!

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.390
Hold on!

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.760
It's my fault
that Hart is missing.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.730
I'll help you find him.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.030
This is my problem, not yours.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.290
No, Kite.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.260
I made a promise to Hart.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.690
That I'd bring you
both back together.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.860
Give him the contact code.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.230
Affirmative!

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.630
If you airheads find him,
this is how to reach us.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.890
Good luck, Kite.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.290
How awful.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.560
Hart's sick and we turned
him over to a stranger.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.230
It's all so confusing.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.160
Why do you even
hunt numbers anyway?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.990
Well, answer me!

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.560
I do it because it's the only

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.030
way I can save
my little brother.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.490
Kite is hunting
numbers to save Hart.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.560
Is he hoping to
cure him somehow?

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.830
Maybe someone else has
promised to cure him.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.890
I wish we knew the truth.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.530
Perhaps we have a clue.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.430
I am curious why dextra and
nistro were searching for Hart.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.460
They were very anxious to
recover the boy, as if they

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.590
wanted to avoid
getting into trouble.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.660
Perhaps they lost Hart and were
trying to retrieve him before

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.590
their superior found out.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.730
Once they got the boy from you,
they planned to take him back.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.690
Back where?

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.990
They not only sit on the
carnival's organizing committee,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.330
but they are enforcers for the

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.660
carnival's chief,
Mr. Heartland.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.330
But if they're working
for Mr. Heartland...

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.990
then the most likely explanation
is that they were trying to

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.560
return Hart to Mr. Heartland.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.760
Hart must have been under

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.260
heartland's custody
when he escaped.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.860
And if that's True, then it's
possible... that in order to

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.960
cure his little
brother Kite is being

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.090
forced to collect numbers
for Mr. Heartland.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.190
And so the person
behind it all...

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.230
... must be Mr. Heartland.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.190
Wait, the person who took Hart

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.660
away wasn't working
for Mr. Heartland.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.060
Correct.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.390
There must be another
powerful figure who

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.360
wants to have
control of Hart.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.790
Someone else?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.560
Who is it?

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.160
Vetrix: Good.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.560
We can start the ritual now.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.860
hart, can you hear me?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.260
where are you?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.290
answer me.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.830
please, little brother.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.390
hart!

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.160
Hart.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.330
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.360
Found you.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.760
You win, Kite.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.790
Like you always do.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.030
You're really good
at hide and seek.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.790
It doesn't matter where I try
to hide, you can always find me.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.190
I always find you, Hart.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.790
I'll find you this time too.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.030
just call out!

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.630
call out to me!

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.990
Finally the moment has come!

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:05.460
I will drain Hart's power
from him and make it mine!

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.290
My plan for revenge can
at long last be fulfilled!

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.630
With my new Power, dr.
Faker will have no chance!

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.630
Yes, I can sense it!

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.630
It's so beautiful.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.160
This must be astral world!

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.830
Hart's power truly is great!

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.660
Stop please...

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.590
No, you can't...

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.460
please!

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.830
The potential is truly awesome!

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.560
I'll be even stronger
than I dared dream!

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.690
I will be all powerful!

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.430
Help me!

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.730
Brother!

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.860
He's calling me!

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.030
That's Hart!

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.460
What's going on astral?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.060
Why'd ya stop?

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.130
Hart is... in trouble.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.060
What kind of trouble?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.430
Do you think he's
in some kinda danger?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.690
Save me, big brother!

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.990
Kite!

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.290
Hurry, please!

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.060
Hart Needs help right away.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.930
He is quite desperate.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.430
Your power is truly incredible!

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.890
It's a shame I can't let
you keep some of it.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:57.130
But unfortunately I must
have all of it for myself!

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.290
Brother...

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.560
I need you!

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.560
Hurry, Kite!

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560
I'm here, Hart!

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.690
Brother!

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.890
How can I find you?

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.260
Tell me!

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.430
Kite!

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.860
Hart, where are you?

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.360
Look for...

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.660
the moon in water...

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.060
and...

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:23.890
a white... castle...

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.460
moon in water.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.160
A white castle.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.960
I'm on my way, Hart!

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.530
So Hart doesn't know
the name of the place?

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.790
No.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.090
But he described it.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.060
It must be near water.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.590
And looks like a white castle.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.060
There's a lot of water
around here, but no castles.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.960
Where could this place be?

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.760
It might be... that abandoned
museum just outside of the city.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.330
Yeah, it could be.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.830
Look here.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.290
It does look sort
of like a castle.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.190
Yeah you're right, Tori.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.160
And there's a pond on the
property, so that could be where

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.860
Hart saw the
reflection of the moon.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.360
That must be the place.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.530
Let's move it.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.630
There's no time to lose.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.230
Kite, come in. Kite!

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.230
That's where
they're holding Hart.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.160
I hope he's alright.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.230
Kite!

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.390
Hart's locked away
in that old museum.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.660
How can you be
sure of that, yuma?

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.790
I just know, okay?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.160
It's not okay!

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.060
There's no room for error!

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.160
My brother's not well!

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.360
I need help, Kite.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.630
Please hurry!

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.460
Yuma, our time is running out.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.830
Listen, Kite.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.060
We have to come up
with a rescue plan quickly.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.330
How did they find us so fast?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.860
Quattro: Who knows?

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.130
Maybe someone tipped them off.
Or maybe Kite followed you here,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.360
Quinton.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.960
Impossible.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.530
Well since they're here, it
would be rude not to say hello.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.760
And then bid them goodbye.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.260
I'll be back.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.830
Don't push your luck, quattro.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.130
Do you think those losers are
too tough for me to handle?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.760
Don't underestimate Kite.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.160
He is a powerful duelist.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
It's Only necessary for you to
delay them until vetrix has

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.690
completed the ritual.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.530
Once we start dueling,
there's no guarantee.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.330
I may not be able
to hold back.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.690
Trey...

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.560
Keep him reined in.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.730
Trey: I will.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.290
You can count on me.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.860
It seems that Hart's
captors are inviting us in.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.190
Then let's accept their

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.030
invitation and go
at them deck to deck!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.090
I'm going in alone.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.630
Bad idea.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.990
You don't even know
who's waiting in there.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.160
Besides I got Hart
into this mess,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.990
and I wanna help get him out!

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.530
No matter what you say, I'm

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.430
gonna be part of
this rescue too.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.000
So what're we
waiting for, c'mon!

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.230
The place looks empty, guys.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.260
Where could Hart be?

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.460
He's gotta be here somewhere.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.390
If it isn't
the infamous Kite.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.930
What an honor.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.930
Hey, it's quattro!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.790
You've met before?

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.560
We have.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.260
Quattro.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.760
I'll be happy to
duel you too, twerp.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.190
You'll suffer the
same fate as your friends.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.060
Do not give in
to your anger, yuma.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.930
If you duel for revenge
you will never defeat him.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.330
Don't worry.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.660
I understand there's something
a lot bigger at stake.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.760
Are you the ones
who took my brother?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.090
Where is he?

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.730
Relax, no harm
has come to him.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.330
At least not yet.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.630
What's that mean?

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.090
When we're finished, we'll
turn Hart back over to you.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.830
Well, what's left of him.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:09.190
If you want to save the kid,
you don't have any choice.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.130
You'll have to
get past us first.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.660
This will be...

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.760
...a tag team duel!

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.990
Excellent!

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.730
Bring it on!

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.560
I'll crush you creeps and
get my brother out of here!

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.130
Hart isn't going anywhere yet!

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.190
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.090
It's on!

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.930
