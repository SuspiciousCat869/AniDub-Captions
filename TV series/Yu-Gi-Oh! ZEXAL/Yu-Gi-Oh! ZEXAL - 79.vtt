WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.439
(girl)
So I ended up studying for about
six hours before I fell asleep.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.008
(girl) Not cool!

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.750
Uh, Shark?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.751
It's only you.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.653
What's up with you, Shark?

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.555
Hey, not so loud!

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:22.256
What gives?

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.690
Why are you acting so weird?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.592
Yeah, is someone after you?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.294
Perhaps Shark is being followed

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.463
by our mutual foes.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:30.764
The Barians?

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.632
(boy) Who is she?

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.766
Whoa, she's really,
really cute.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.736
(boy) Who's the new girl?

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.705
(boy)
Is this what
a crush feels like?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.307
(girl) Sheesh, Reginald!

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.609
I thought we'd walk
to school together.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.044
Why did you leave me behind?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.213
What are you,
too cool to be seen

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.382
with your younger sister?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.349
Hi, great to see you

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.118
back on your feet, Rio!

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.019
I'm Tori!

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.288
It's so nice to meet
some friendly faces!

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.723
What a great start to
my first day of class.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.494
Hopefully we can all
end up being friends.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.262
I'll so be your friend!

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.666
I mean, welcome to our school!

(boy)
I'm gonna ask her
to the dance.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.764
(boy)
It bother anyone that
she's Shark's sister?

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:11.765
(boy) No, not really.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.367
(boy) Me neither!

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:13.767
I see.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.702
So you would like me
to win Yuma's Numbers

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.371
from him then, Girag?

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:17.738
That's not all.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:21.241
I want you to win me
someone else's Number too.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.242
Shark!

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:22.743
Ah, Shark.

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:25.379
It just so happens that
his younger sister Rio

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.346
is now attending our school.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:30.751
(Girag)
Well, that's a little fact
we'll have to exploit!

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.653
I want you to get
a hold of this "Rio"

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:37.090
then use her as bait to get
to Shark and his Number!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.758
But of course Girag.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:41.495
I will do everything I can
in the name of Barian World.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.131
(all)
In the name of
Barian World!

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.434
(Tori)
I'm glad you were finally well
enough to leave the hospital.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.737
So you're totally,
100% back to normal now?

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:51.738
Yep, good as new!

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.740
I had to get better
because Reginald needs me.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.376
He'd lose his head if it
wasn't attached to his neck.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.278
Why, just this morning
he overslept.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.180
If I hadn't stopped him
he would have run

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.682
out of the house
in his pajamas.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.617
Ha, bet they have
little sharks on 'em.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.186
His PJs aren't even the worst
part, he sleeps with...

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.188
Rio, watch what you say!

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.590
Remember, I've read
your diary!

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.126
So be quiet or else.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.261
Or else what?

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.130
Well, Mr. Night Light?

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.365
Just never mind!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.734
By the way, aren't you
the one who dueled Reginald

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:21.735
and actually beat him?

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.470
Yeah, of course,
I know who you are!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.606
I guess I am getting
pretty popular.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:30.277
You sure are, Kite Tenjo!

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:31.545
I'm Yuma!

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.313
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.648
Oh, yeah!

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.749
I've heard of you too!

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.050
You're the one who
always lucks out

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.752
and wins by accident, right?

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.754
Did you say "by accident"?

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.656
How's your catchphrase go?

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:43.757
Think I got it!

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.759
I am healing my toe!

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.129
No, it's "I'm feeling
the flow!"

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.097
You sure?

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:52.365
That sounds wrong to me.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.533
Excuse me?

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.671
Ah, at last we meet,
Rio Kastle!

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.371
Hey there.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.706
Can I help you?
Yes, you can.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.075
I'm the captain of
the soccer team.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:02.743
We need you!

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.745
Join us and manage
the school team.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.146
Are you in?

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.148
(clamoring)

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.649
Wow it is nice to be wanted!

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.251
After school I'll
visit each of your teams

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.020
and select the one that'll
be the best fit for me.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.356
(all) Yeah!

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:18.592
(Bronk) This is nuts!

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:19.760
You mean she's gonna take on

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.728
the whole soccer
team by herself?

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.730
Rio is challenging all
the teams at our school.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.766
She said she'll join
the one that can beat her.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.434
Seems unfair to me, though.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.703
The odds are not in her favor!

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:30.337
Okay, Rio.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.472
You may think your good,
but no one is this good.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.474
That was true, 'til now!

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:37.644
Here goes!

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:43.450
No way!

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.585
She made it through them all!

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.355
Amazing!

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:57.830
Come on!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.533
(Rio)
You guys can do
better than this!

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.401
If you want me to
manage your team,

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:05.739
then try bringing your
game up to my level!

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:11.745
Wow, Rio!

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.713
That was, like, totally insane!

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.415
Why, thank you, Yuma.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.616
(boy)
She's so full
of herself!

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:18.585
(boy)
She won't make any
friends with that 'tude!

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:20.754
(boy)
Like brother
like sister!

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:21.755
Those guys are so rude.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.758
It's okay I ignore
people like that.

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.760
Some people resent it
when a girl turns out

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.029
to be more than
just a pretty face.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.697
A pretty face,
she's so much more.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.732
She's the girl I'd
split my lunch with!

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.735
(girl)
You're Rio
Kastle, right?

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.737
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.206
The president of
our club has heard

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.740
really great things about you.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.075
She'd love to meet!

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:45.579
Are you free to drop
by right now?

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.050
(woman)
Thank you for
coming, Rio.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.753
I am Lotus Hanazoe, the head of
the school floral design club

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:57.457
and I'm pleased you brought
your friends with you.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.393
I think you will find our
club the perfect place

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.229
to let your roots settle.

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.763
We'll provide you a sunny patch

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:07.634
to flourish in our
little garden.

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.736
Haven't you trimmed
that flower enough?

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.671
There's not much left.
Oh, not at all.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.675
We pride ourselves on knowing
just how far to take our flora

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:19.145
so that each bud
may fully blossom.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.147
And soon, my new sprouts...

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.682
(Astral) Yuma?

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:23.750
Yuma...

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.752
Yuma!

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:29.556
Yuma, look all around you!

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.761
Why is everyone sleeping?

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.764
I suspect she has lulled
them into a trance

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.767
using the tenor of her voice.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.135
But, why would she?

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:42.736
What's she planning?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.705
The answer may lie in the
darkness I am sensing.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:50.010
I suspect she is an
agent of Barian World!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.751
Are they okay?
Impressive.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.186
You resisted the
power of my voice.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.755
What are you up to, huh?

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.590
I see no harm in telling you.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.226
My plan was to use
Rio, as bait,

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:10.230
to get to Shark and his Number.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.264
That is so wrong!

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.700
Perhaps, but you may
like my new plan better.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.734
As you avoided group nap time,

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:18.238
I will duel you for
your Numbers!
Think again!

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:19.706
You'll... ow!

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.541
Pins and needles, make it stop!

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.677
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
You are funny Yuma.

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:26.246
Sad, but funny.
I'll show you funny!

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:29.749
(Rio)
And I'll be
here watching!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.385
Not you too!

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:32.719
Rio!

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.120
I thought you fell
asleep as well?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.056
Something just didn't
feel right to me,

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.091
so I faked falling
under her control!

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.660
My, my, what a clever
girl you are!

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.562
Listen, don't worry
about a thing Rio!

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:45.098
Yuma's on the job,
you're safe with me here!

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:48.268
I'll protect you!
I'll be okay.

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.537
Lotus I heard all
about your big plan!

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:53.540
You stay away from my
brother Shark, you hear me?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.010
If you want to duel
someone, then duel me!

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.179
Really?

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.514
You will regret that.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.287
We'll see about that!

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.531
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.567
Let's duel!

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.369
Now I will start us off!

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:24.637
My turn, I draw!

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.207
This duel has just
begun to bloom.

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:31.444
I summon Fire Lily
in attack mode!

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:39.753
And I activate the
field spell Zen Garden!

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.755
Not only does it
beautify the scenery,

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.992
but Water monsters
can no longer attack.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.762
Lotus' first draw certainly
proves her duel deck

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:50.697
was ready and waiting to
battle against Shark.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.501
Your first problem has just
sprouted up in the duel field.

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.069
You see when I have one flower,

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:59.339
my garden allows me
to plant another.

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.175
And that will be
Ferocious Flora!

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.310
Now when there are two
Plant-Type monsters

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.215
on my field, I can
summon my Cosmos!

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.490
She summoned three
Level 3 monsters already.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:24.130
I overlay Level 3 Fire Lily,
Ferocious Flora and Cosmos!

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.767
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:33.740
and Xyz Summon
Battlecruiser Dianthus!

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.248
And now due to
Zen Garden's effect

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.984
my long planned strategy
will really take root!

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:48.021
You see Xyz Monsters
gain 100 attack points

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.456
for every rank they have!

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:50.757
If you think things
look bleak now,

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:54.727
just wait until I activate
Dianthus' special ability!

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.765
By using one Overlay Unit,
you take 300 points of damage

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.667
for every card in your hand,

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.735
so with five cards
in your hand,

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:06.739
you will take 1,500
points of damage!

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.275
Go Big Cannon!

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.514
Rio!

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:20.320
I believe your confidence
has been uprooted.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.756
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:27.760
Not bad Lotus, but
it's my move, I draw!

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.097
I summon Blizzard Falcon!

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:38.972
Next I activate the spell card
Blizzard Jet from my hand!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.575
Now my Blizzard Falcon
gains a bone chilling

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:47.480
1,500 attack points
for this turn!

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.750
3,000 attack points!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.454
That's awesome, but
not for you Lotus!

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.122
Pity.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.056
All that effort for naught.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.759
My Zen Garden field spell
prevents Water Monsters

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.761
such as your Falcon
from attacking.

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.763
Who says I'll be attacking?

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.766
I'm activating Blizzard
Falcon's special ability!

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:10.436
Since Blizzard Falcon gained
1,500 attack points this turn,

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:14.574
you take 1,500
points of damage!

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:20.513
Aw, yeah!
I concur.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.448
It seems Rio knows
what she is doing.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:27.187
I place three cards
facedown and end my turn!

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.491
Rio Kastle...

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.394
She just won't go down
without a fight.

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:36.362
Dueling me was a foolish move!

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:40.133
And now you will reap
what you have sown.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:41.467
My turn, I draw!

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:47.740
So from my hand, I activate
Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force!

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:51.077
And now I rebuild
the Overlay Network

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:55.415
with Battlecruiser Dianthus!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:02.055
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.190
Barian power born of chaos...

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.760
visit your judgment
on this world of filth!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.766
Come forth, Chaos Xyz
Battleship Cherry Blossom!

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.472
(Lotus)
Say hello to my
Cherry Blossom!

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:22.275
Watch out Rio!
I got this Yuma.

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:23.576
Oh, I highly doubt that.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.144
You see, due to
Zen Garden's effect,

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:29.449
my Xyz Monster gains 100 attack
points for each of its ranks!

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:33.319
Now the hopelessness you feel
is about to double as I activate

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.755
Cherry Blossom's
special ability.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.757
By using one Chaos
Overlay Unit,

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:42.762
you take 400 points of damage
for every card on the field.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.532
You have four cards
and I have three.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.269
Do you know what that makes?

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.670
Ah, math sneak attack!

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.071
Okay three and four is, um...

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:56.109
Wait, I got this!
2,800 points of damage!

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.217
It appears my Cherry
Blossom made sure

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:07.487
you felt the burn that time.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:16.129
But how... you
should be cinders!

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.131
I don't lose my cool
that easy, Lotus.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.167
You see before Cherry Blossom's
special ability kicked in,

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.403
I activated the trap
card Diamond Dust!

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.471
It destroyed my Water
Attribute monster.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.473
So I only had two
cards on my field

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.642
and just took 2,000
points of damage!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:34.113
And that's only the beginning
of what this trap card can do!

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:36.316
But I don't think
you'll like the rest!

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.552
You take 500 points of
damage for every monster

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.455
that was destroyed.

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.557
Rio's a great duelist,
isn't she?

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.759
I am afraid that remains
to be seen, Yuma.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.495
You are as bothersome
as a weed in a garden,

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.731
it is time I prune
you for good!

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.600
And this should do
the trick nicely.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.469
Cherry Blossom attack!

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:57.737
Flower Shower!

00:13:57.737 --> 00:14:01.741
Nice try but I activate
the trap Ice Chain!

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.010
This card will put
a stop your strategy

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.145
by letting me summon
one Level 4-or-below

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.514
Water Attribute monster
from my hand!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:12.618
So help me welcome
back my Aurora Wing!

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.757
Since my Aurora Wing
was destroyed in battle,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.329
I can summon it back from my
graveyard in defense mode!

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:26.599
Well, that move bought
you a tiny bit of time.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.534
Speaking of which,
I will bide mine.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:31.471
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.408
Now there's something on
my mind I really must ask.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:38.745
Tell me, how much longer
can you hang on?

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.380
Let's find out!

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.347
I draw!

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:44.484
Now I activate the spell
card Monster Reborn!

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:48.755
It allows me to summon Blizzard
Falcon from my graveyard!

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.759
I will welcome your monster
back with the trap Rose Marker!

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:56.529
And just like the flower,
Rose Marker is prickly.

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:57.530
When you activate a card,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.501
it deals you a total
of 300 points of damage.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.571
Oh no, Rio!

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.541
Looks like Lotus still
has plenty of bad seeds

00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.743
in her garden!

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:15.748
Yes, very well put Yuma,
because you see...

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.284
Now, just like a flower
that has been neglected

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:22.755
and left out in the cold,
I will watch you wilt!

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:27.727
(Lotus)
And now, like a flower that has
been left out in the cold,

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:30.997
I will watch you wilt!

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.566
That won't be happening
anytime soon!

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:36.002
You see I just made
a change to my strategy,

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.738
and that means I'll be
winning this duel much sooner

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.173
than I imagined!

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:41.107
Bet you want to know how,

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.009
well, if you think
our duel's been icy,

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:46.512
you haven't seen anything yet!

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:51.417
I overlay Level 4 Blizzard
Falcon and Aurora Wing!

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:56.189
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:15:56.189 --> 00:16:01.027
I Xyz Summon Ice
Beast Zerofyne!

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:12.538
Your monster certainly
can make an entrance.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:16.476
But it takes more than
a chilling entry to defeat me.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.577
Oh, not to worry.

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:19.212
Your Zen Garden will help, too.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.747
Zerofyne gains 100
attack points per rank

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.583
because of your field spell!

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:26.652
I activate Zerofyne's
special ability.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.221
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:31.724
all other face up cards
lose their effects!

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.560
And now I use the
ability Perfect Freeze!

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.761
For every card that
loses its effects,

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:40.766
your monster loses
300 attack points.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:48.274
That means Cherry Blossom
loses 900 attack points.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:53.746
Since Zen Garden
lost its effects,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.750
Xyz Monsters no longer
have an attack boost.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.220
I'd say your Zen Garden
just got trampled!

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.624
This sets the stage
for my next move.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.759
Now Zerofyne!

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.662
Attack Cherry Blossom!

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:12.498
No I think not,
because I activate

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:14.166
the spell Flower Judgment!

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:17.603
Your monster's special ability
disabled my face up cards!

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.739
But I can still use
my facedown cards!

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:23.476
And this spell sends all of
Cherry Blossom's Overlay Units

00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:25.745
to the graveyard,
but Cherry Blossom

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:29.215
gains 800 attack points
for each one!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.450
So I do not think
your silly Zerofyne

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.755
will pose any threat
to my monster.

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:40.760
It's got 3,100 attack points!

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.762
All your icy attacks
are no match

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:46.532
for my frightful
Flower Monsters!

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:48.734
Think again!

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:52.605
Your chances of winning are
about to get snowed in!

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:55.741
I activate the spell
Freezing Point!

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.412
Since your Xyz Monster
has no Overlay Units,

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.481
it loses all its attack points!

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.286
So thanks to my
spell, your monster

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:11.557
has gone from powerful
to powerless!

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.125
This cannot be happening!

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.194
My flowers have
never failed me!

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:18.331
They say there's a first
time for everything!

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.398
Show her Zerofyne!

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:23.269
Attack Cherry Blossom
with Icicle Storm!

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:47.393
Yeah, you did it, Rio!

00:18:47.393 --> 00:18:49.228
You're a real Ice Queen!

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:52.565
(Rio) Excuse me?

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.368
Well, you know what I meant...

00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:58.204
Yeah, I do,
just messing with you.

00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.338
I'm not Reginald.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:02.375
I have a sense of
humor, you know.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:02.742
Rio won?

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:05.144
When is my losing
streak gonna' end?

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:09.749
Hope they don't hear about
this in Barian World...

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:16.656
What happened?

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:17.757
How did we all fall asleep?

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:19.692
Did we have a slumber party?

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.661
(Shark)
Hey, Rio, caught
the match.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.763
It was an okay duel I guess.

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.598
But Shark, you missed it!

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:26.732
Nope, I saw it!

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.300
You watched the whole time?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.736
Yep, upset I didn't
give you any pointers?

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.572
I don't need your help!

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.442
Rio dueled like a real pro.

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:38.411
She is one
tough cookie.
Nah.

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:42.548
Deep down, she goes to
pieces pretty quickly.

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:49.755
Cat, cat, cat!

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.724
Don't tell me you're
scared of a kitten?

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.459
C'mon.
I know it's weird,

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:55.761
but they give me
the heebie jeebies!

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.329
Aww, but look how cute she is.

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.032
Reginald, I need you to
get rid of it now!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.135
I thought you said you
don't need my help, Rio?

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.370
Come on!

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.406
She's cute when
she's terrified!

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.976
No!
