00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:04.938
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal".

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.406
Hey
Kite!

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.742
I've been waitin' a long
time to take you on again.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.545
Now we'll finally see
who the better duelist is!

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.913
Bring it
on, Yuma!

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.815
Let 'em
have it Utopia!

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.085
Attack with
Rising Sun Slash!

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:24.224
♪

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.527
Yes!

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.561
Did you
guys see that?

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.196
Give it up
for this guy!

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.598
(Kite)
He really is
quite remarkable.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.735
No matter how many times
he's knocked to the floor

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.470
he always jumps
right up again

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.338
and gets back
to dueling.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.276
I, on the other hand,
am nothing like Yuma.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.479
I give up,
you win.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.647
Now that
Hart is okay,

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.782
I don't need to
collect Number Cards.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.950
I forfeit.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.052
Dueling lacks
purpose for me.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.254
Listen Kite,
you are wrong.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.456
You see, dueling
does have a purpose.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.125
Though you
cannot see it.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.726
The more you
duel with someone,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.828
the deeper your
bonds grow together.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.932
Friendships carry
you into the future.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:07.234
Please
understand, Kite.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.670
You do not need
to live in the past.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.206
Live instead
for the future.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.809
I've never had
many friends.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.678
But it sounds like
dueling opens up a world

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:21.381
of possibilities and I'd
be a fool to ignore that.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.450
You ready
to get beat?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.252
You'll regret
those words.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.620
See...

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.157

not in the cards!

Yuma, I'm gonna

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.590
you talked me back
into this match.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.092
Yeah, yeah, less
yapping, more dueling.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.194
My turn.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.063

All right, I'm activating
my spell, Card of Adversity!

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.570
Since you have
Utopia on your field

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.706
and I have no
monsters on my field,

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:58.045
it allows me to
draw two cards.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.480
And I'm gonna use
one of 'em right now.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.116
I activate
Accellight!

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.419
And it'll fill up
my empty field fast.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.454
That's because when
I have no monsters

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:11.758
I can bring out a level 4 Light
Warrior monster from my deck.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:15.595
And I think I'll do exactly
that and call on Daybreaker!

I will.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.108
Like you even have
a choice about that, Yuma.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.277
When I summon
one Daybreaker.

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:35.315
I can call out a
second one to join it.

Can you guess
what's next?

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.687
I overlay my two
Level 4 Daybreakers.

No, he
is not.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.204
Exactly
right Astral,

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.172

Starliege Paladynamo's

special
ability activates.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.610
And then by using
one Overlay Unit,

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.279
the attack points of
your Utopia become zero,

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.949

field other than Paladynamo

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.685

effects.

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.689
Utopia's special
abilities are gone?

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.023
That's
right.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.359
It can be destroyed
even though it's a Number.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.794
Let's show
'em what I mean.

you're in over

I equip this card on
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:13.393
that's in my graveyard to
summon it back in attack mode.

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:17.197
However, Galaxy-Eyes loses
all its special abilities.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:18.865
(roars)

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.500
Welcome back
Galaxy-Eyes.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.669
This duel just got
a whole lot tougher.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.672
Which means it got a
whole lot more fun too.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.307
Galaxy-Eyes
may be back,

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.442
but it loses 800
attack points in battle

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.678
due to Galaxy
Zero's effect.

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:37.484
Well Dextra, Yuma may be
able to get the upper hand now.

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:39.319
You wish.

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:42.288

that's over,

"What gives" is
that since my Dragon

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:46.573
is no longer equipped
with Galaxy Zero,

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.675
it loses all
its attack points.

That would normally
be a bad thing, but Yuma,

about your own card?

attack points.

attack was cancelled out.

Remember the spell
Battle Gravity?

didn't attack

you take 1000
points of damage

end for you Yuma

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.149

300 life points left.
