WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
(Yuma)
Last time onYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL...

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.740
My power has returned to me.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.745
And now my true reign begins!

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.250
I have fused your world
and Barian World together.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.750
Aah!

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.385
(Yuma) It can't be...

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.388
(Astral) Let us duel as one!

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.290
(Yuma)
I build the Overlay Network

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.429
and XYZ Summon
Number 39... Utopia!

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.765
You seem confident...

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.733
Let us find out

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:38.305
if your confidence holds
once a new reality sets in.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:40.741
Utopia!

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.743
What's going on?

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.479
What is Ganbara Knight
doing here?

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.515
I activated
Numeron XYZ revision.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:52.286
I have mastery over the past,
present and future.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.621
So I rewrote your past.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.322
That must mean...

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:58.759
Don Thousand has acquired
the power of the Numeron Code!

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:02.596
(Don Thousand)
Fusing our two worlds
together allowed me

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.365
to activate the field spell
Numeron network

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.036
giving me mastery
over the Numeron Code.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:10.070
With this new power,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.740
I can finally rip
a portal between dimensions.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.742
Extinction looms moments away

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:19.646

and Astral World!

Your defeat is inevitable.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:28.048
It is my destiny to
rule the galaxy.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:29.549
Destiny? As if!

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.688
(Yuma)
My friends and I are takin'
you down, Don Thousand.

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:39.092
(Tori)
C'mon guys...
I know you can do this.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.328
Face it.
(grunting)

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.363
We're never giving up.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.197
Such spirit...

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.200
But deep within you must
know that your efforts

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.602
to stop me are all in vain.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.239
(Astral)
Don Thousand's field spell
Numeron network

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.307
gives him
a significant advantage.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.109
If we do not find
a way to prevent him

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.748
from rewriting our actions,
we will not win this duel.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:07.287
(Don Thousand)
It is my turn... I draw!

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.057
And thus begins your end...

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.759
Numeron calling!

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.699
(Don Thousand)
All the energies of
Barian World

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.269
course through the Numeron
Network to power this card...

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.740
allowing me to summon
four Numbers at once!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.444
And these will be
no ordinary Numbers.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.612
Witness the advent
of true power...

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.114
the first four Numbers!

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.515
He's just kidding right?

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.752
(Don Thousand)
The Numbers 1 through 4
you faced before

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.153
were my creations.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:46.126
Allow me to demonstrate the
might of the genuine articles!

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.664
First is Number 4!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.671
Numeron Gate Catvari!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.440
(Yuma)
Look at the size
of that thing!

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.012
(Don Thousand)
Next I summon...
Number 3 and Number 2

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:09.750
Numeron Gate Trini!

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.755
And Numeron Gate Dve!

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.056
And finally...

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:20.761
Witness the ascent of Number 1!

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.429
Ah!

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.531
Uhh!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.238
(Don Thousand)
Numeron Gate Ekam!

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.749
(Yuma) Whoa!

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.251
They can all combine?!

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.087
(Don Thousand)
The original four
come together

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.624
to form the Numeron Gate.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.693
But each one's only got
a thousand attack points.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.763
Yuma, smash
those things to bits!

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.498
Smash 'em with what?

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:02.702
The only monster on our field
has no attack points.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:06.306
And all of its special
abilities have been negated.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.010
We can't go charging
straight at those things.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.978
Our situation may look bleak,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.747
but we do have one advantage

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:14.648
Now that he has monsters,

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:18.618
he can no longer use Numeron
Network to rewrite our cards.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:19.419
Good point.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.256
Number 1 Ekam attacks
Ganbara Knight!

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.695
I activate Half Unbreak!

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.631
This trap'll save Ganbara
Knight from destruction

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:35.302
and cut the damage
I take in half.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.739
Even so...
The damage you did take

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:43.009
will also rain down
on Astral World!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.744
(both gasping)

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.382
(Astral) No...

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.526
The battle has begun.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.229
Not only is
Astral World's fate at stake,

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.765
but also every living
being in the galaxy.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.701
(Don Thousand)
Tell me, Astral...

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.739
How does it feel to
witness your own Armageddon?

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:13.506
(groaning)

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.575
You're the lowest of the low!

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.743
(Nash)
Stay cool.
Huh?

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:20.747
You need to focus
on surviving this turn.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.749
(Don Thousand) Surviving?

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.617
I think not.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:27.687
After every battle,
Ekam can use one Overlay Unit

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:32.092
to double the attack points
of all my Numeron monsters.

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:36.363
Except that Ekam doesn't
have any Overlay Units.

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:39.766
Your attempts to outwit me
are amusing!

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.534
But with Numeron
Network in play,

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.504
my Numeron monsters do not
need Overlay Units

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:46.306
to activate
their special abilities.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.175
What?
Seriously?
(gasps)

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.746
The energy flowing
through the Numeron Network

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.748
is powering his monsters.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.350
(Don Thousand)
Ekam uses its special ability

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.687
to double
my monsters' attack points!

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:07.294
And my other three Numbers
possess this ability as well!

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.762
So every time he battles,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.464
those monsters are gonna
get a lot stronger.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.334
(groaning)
Then how can we beat him?

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:16.102
Yuma.
Huh?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.138
We must take away his advantage

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:21.007
by eliminating
the Numeron Network.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.309
But how do we do that?

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.412
I'm all for it, but we don't
know where the card is.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.682
(Astral)
When Don Thousand activates
the Field Spell,

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.517
a light
runs through the network

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:32.485
that threads throughout
this world...

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.321
Perhaps the energy is flowing

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:35.755
toward the source
of the Network.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.758
I can attempt to follow
the energy signature

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:39.759
back to its origin...

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:45.298
and discover the location
of the Numeron Network card.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.237
This means you two will
have to duel without my help.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.610
But Astral...

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.679
(Astral)
This is our only hope...

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.050
Just survive long enough
for me to locate the card...

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.751
He's gone.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.187
(Don Thousand)
So the coward abandoned you.

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:11.725
He knew as I do
it is pointless to resist.

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:12.225
Now...

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:16.629
Cower before the guardian
of the Numeron Gate!

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:22.268
Dve advance forward
and attack Ganbara Knight!

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.009
(roaring)

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.611
That takes the word
"ugly" and raises it

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.546
to a whole new level!

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.215
Get ready, Yuma.

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:35.982
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:41.554
I activate Half Unbreak
again to protect my monster!

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:48.762
Aah!

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.265
(both groaning)

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.702
(Don Thousand)
As with Ekam, DVE's
special ability

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:56.703
doubles the attack points

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.140
of every piece
of the Numeron Gate.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.741
We have to buy Astral time

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.743
to find
the Numeron Network card...

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.746
Whatever it takes,
we've got to hold on.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.447
I know.

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:11.618
(Don Thousand)
Now an even more powerful
Numeron Trini

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.253
attacks Ganbara Knight!

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:16.756
One more time, Half Unbreak!

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.761
(screaming)

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.330
(screaming)

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.566
(both groaning)

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:28.735
Yuma! You okay?

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:32.305
(Don Thousand)
Number 3's special
ability activates.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:38.078
Once again, the attack points
of my Numeron monsters double.

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.750
(groaning) 8,000 attack points.

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:47.720
Half Unbreak won't be
enough to save us this time.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.022
(groaning)

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:51.124
The time has come.

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.425
Farewell.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.428
Your struggle is over.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:55.762
As are you.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:59.766
Attack Ganbara Knight
and end this duel!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:00.333
(both gasping)

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.403
(Nash)
Not going to happen because
I have Cutter Shark!

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:08.741
It switches places with
Ganbara Knight in defense mode!

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:20.353
Wow, thanks for havin' my back!

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:23.656
(groaning)

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:26.693
I am getting closer...

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.231
Your persistence is
starting to annoy me.

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.634
You are only delaying
your demise.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.136
Catvari's special ability

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.340
doubles all my monsters'
attack points again.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.610
16,000 attack points?

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.078
I am not done!

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:48.748
Numeron Network allows me
to rank up Ekam

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.683
into a Chaos Monster.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:51.351
No way...

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.721
(Don Thousand)
I overlay Numeron Gate Ekam!

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:59.359
Behold the rise of
Chaos Number 1!

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:05.565
(gasping)

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:13.139
Witness the ultimate
harbinger of destruction.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:17.443
Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.379
(sinister laughter)

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:20.747
When I summon Sunya,

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:24.984
I can banish every monster
on the field.

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:30.723
However, Sunya returns
to my field

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:33.459
at the beginning
of my next turn.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:35.261
And when it does...

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.629
you will take damage

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.765
equal to the combined
attack points

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.968
of every monster
that was banished.

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:48.741
(Yuma) That's...
50,000 points of damage.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.377
If he's able to
get to his next turn...

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.213
it's all over.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.222
I draw!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.757
First I summon Boom Shark!

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:07.694
It self-destructs
when it battles...

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.663
but when it does,
you take damage

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:12.498
equal to its attack points.

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:14.367
And speaking of attack points,

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.303
I activate the
spell card Aqua Jet,

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:21.407
which'll give Boom Shark
some extra fire power.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.443
Good stuff!

00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.311
Now you can attack
Don Thousand directly

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:29.515
and dish out 4,000 points
of damage to win the duel!

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.084
I wish.
Huh?

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.753
I activate Numeron
Network's effect.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:38.358
By sending a Numeron card
from my deck to the graveyard,

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:41.194
I can activate its effect.
Huh?

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:43.596
The card I am sending is...

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.765
Numeron Spell Revision!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.100
When you play a spell card,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.069
Numeron Spell Revision
rewrites that card

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.272
into an entirely
different spell.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:55.742
(Nash)
It changed into
the spell card Surface!

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:56.709
(Don Thousand) Correct.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.745
So instead of
powering up Boom Shark,

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.514
you instead have to
summon a Water monster

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.150
from your graveyard
in defense mode.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.387
I summon Cutter Shark...

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.491
(Don Thousand)
And Boom Shark self-destructs

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.761
when another monster
appears on your field.

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:18.464
So much for your strategy!

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.334
(gasping)

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.138
(groaning)

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.273
I must go on...

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:30.743
I have to reach
the source of this energy...

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.146
(screaming)

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:33.746
We're cooked...

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.748
As long as he has
Numeron Network,

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.651
he can keep swapping
cards on us both.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.019
(Nash)
Don't give up.
Hmm?

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.156
We'll fight
to our last life point!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.757
Of course.

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:48.661
I activate the spell
Rank-Up Rising!

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.630
When a Water monster
is destroyed

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.533
and sent to the graveyard,
I can use Rank-Up Rising

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.235
to pull a Rank-Up-Magic
card from my deck

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.503
and add it to my hand.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:02.175
I activate Rank-Up-Magic...
the seventh one!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.276
Ah!

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:09.749
Take to the skies Number
101... Silent Honor Ark!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.054
But I'm not done yet!

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:19.359
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:23.329
Chaos XYZ Evolution!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:31.104
Get ready for Chaos Number
101... Silent Honor Dark!

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:34.741
You couldn't swap cards
on me this time...

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:36.743
because Numeron
Network's effect

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.746
can only be used once per turn.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:42.415
And now, Silent Honor Dark

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:44.384
uses all its
Chaos Overlay Units

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:49.689
to summon Silent Honor Aar
back from the graveyard!

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:53.259
You did it, Shark!

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:53.760
All you gotta do

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:57.230
is attack with those two
and he's done for!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.764
Interesting...

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.500
Have you been planning
this from the beginning?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.236
That's right, I've
been planning your defeat

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:07.507
even before your hair started
glowing like a light bulb.

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:11.077
I never would have imagined
that someone like you

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.745
could actually beat me.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.747
You don't have to imagine.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.748
You're going to live it!

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:19.752
Silent Honor Ark
attacks you directly!

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:26.125
And Silent Honor Dark
finishes you off.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.228
Bye-bye, Don Thousand!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.663
You fools.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.765
I am not going anywhere.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.600
Since I took battle damage,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.503
I can summon Numeron Wall
from my hand

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:40.406
and instantly end the battle.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.008
(both gasping)

00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.744
As I said,
I could never imagine

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:46.512
someone like you defeating me.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.116
(grunting) This isn't over.

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:55.154
(Astral) That light...

00:15:58.224 --> 00:15:59.325
This is it...

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:03.696
I have located
the Numeron Network card.

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.533
Astral found the card.

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:14.373
But you are too late, Astral.

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.509
My victory is assured.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:21.347
Not if you lose access to the
Numeron Network, Don Thousand.

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.281
(Don Thousand) Amusing.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.650
Just how do you
plan on doing that?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.585
Quite simple.

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:29.755
I will remove this card
and then destroy it.

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:30.756
I see.

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.492
But if you destroy that card,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.760
then all the immense
energy that has accumulated

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.631
at that location will be
instantly unleashed,

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.766
rippling outward
in all directions.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:43.002
Though Astral World
may survive,

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.171
Earth definitely will not.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.739
(Yuma) So wait, you mean...

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:49.275
Earth will be destroyed?

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:50.710
(Don Thousand)
What will you do?

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.548
Will you sacrifice Earth
to save Astral World?

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:57.683
Astral...

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:01.754
If you do not, then I shall
annihilate your friends

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:03.756
along with your precious home.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.527
The choice is yours...

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:17.270
Do I save Earth,
or do I save Astral World?

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.074
I know what I must do.
My decision is clear.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.077
Uh, Astral?

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.684
Wait a second...
what are you doing?

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.753
Astral!

00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:36.756
(Astral)
I know what I must do...

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:39.458
And I do this...

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.229
For the future!

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:50.736
Astral brought that
card out of hiding.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.412
Now I know what I've got to do.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:04.016
I activate Silent Honor
Dark's special ability!

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.117
It absorbs your monster

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:09.322
and turns it into
a Chaos Overlay Unit!

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:16.295
Then I activate the spell
card Depth Eruption!

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:18.331
And it's a real game changer

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:23.703
because this eruption destroys
every card on the field.

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:28.140
What are you doing?

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:36.716
Oh, no...

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:41.487
Shark, without Numeron Network,
Earth will be wiped out!

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:42.655
(Astral) Yuma...

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:44.557
Can you hear me?

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:47.059
Do not worry.
Earth will be fine.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:50.529
I will absorb all the energy.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.764
(gasping)

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:54.066
You what?

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:56.736
Astral, you can't do that!

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:59.405
There's no way you
could ever survive it!

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:04.210
(Astral)
It is up to you now, Yuma.
Do not lose.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.080
You must feel the flow,
my friend.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.149
Don't do this!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.753
(groaning)
This is really
not cool, Astral!

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:17.723
I mean... There has to
be another way, right?

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:21.394
There's always another way.

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:23.362
Astral, don't go!

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:27.099
Farewell... Yuma...

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.739
(gasping)

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:39.745
(Astral) Eliphas?

00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:43.215
Astral...

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.251
What are you doing here?

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:48.554
Atoning for my past mistakes.

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:52.758
You have given much hope to
the people of Astral World.

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:55.294
We cannot lose you now.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.763
He's absorbing the power!

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:02.535
Astral... My time
has finally come...

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.572
But your time
is just beginning.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.643
Eliphas! No!

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:18.751
Whoa, no way...

00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:22.755
Eliphas... how dare
you interfere.

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:26.192
Eliphas saved Earth.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:28.360
Astral...

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.563
(Astral) He is no more.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.632
But he left us something
to remember him by.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:38.204
He placed the future of
Astral World in our hands...

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:43.075
And I have no intention
of letting him down.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.744
Because I know this.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:48.080
We must win this duel
at all costs.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.117
For our friends...
For the future...

00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.552
You don't have to
convince me...

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:54.754
Let's do this!

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.189
When Silent Honor
Dark is destroyed

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.758
while it has
Chaos Overlay Units,

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:02.762
it resurrects back to my field!

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.198
And then...

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.533
We regain life points

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:11.737
equal to Silent Honor Dark's
attack points.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:18.744
I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.579
Awesome.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:24.250
Your win's not a sure
thing anymore, is it?

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.251
But I'll tell you what is!

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:27.553
For the sake of
the whole universe...

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:30.422
you're going down!
