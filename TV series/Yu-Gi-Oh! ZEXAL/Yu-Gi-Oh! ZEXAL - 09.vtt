cat, are you?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.030
Astral think she's
got a number card?

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.460
If she does have a number
then you have to win this duel.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.390
I was planning on
winning either way.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.530
Let's do this!

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.330
Duel Disk go!

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.060
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.990
Duel Interface set!

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.990
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.060
Both: Let's duel!

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.730
My claws are sharp!

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.360
And I've got all nine lives!

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.090
So get ready - I draw!

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.990
First!...

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.060
I'll activate the inviting cat
card from my hand.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.690
So she's kicking things
off with a spell

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.530
thanks to inviting cat, I can
add a stray cat to my hand.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.230
But that's not all

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.730
next, I'm activating the
continuous spell, cat meeting!

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.690
A continuous spell!

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.690
As long as she meets the
conditions she can activate

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.560
that spell over and over.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.430
Here, Kitty Kitty first I
summon stray cat in attack mode.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:26.990
And when I summon a cat monster,
cat meeting activates, allowing

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.730
me to summon another stray!

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.090
After all, no Kitty
likes to be alone.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.390
[meow]

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.230
maybe not.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.730
But those mangy alley cats only
have a hundred attack points.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.190
They're totally harmless!

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.430
You think so?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.760
You're probably right.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.060
I'm not sure what I was thinking
silly me.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.160
I'll just place a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.060
Well?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.090
It's your move, yuma

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.190
All right then.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.630
Get set to get decked!

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:59.690
I'm summoning achacha Archer!

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.330
And When achacha Archer is
successfully summoned, he can

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.630
instantly dish out
500 points of damage!

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.590
[Ahh]

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.030
[ouch]

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.460
and there's plenty more
where that came from!

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.530
Yuma, wait!

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.990
Let us talk this
through first.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.360
What's there to talk about!?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.760
achacha Archer attack!

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.390
Wha-!?

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.330
what's the hold up, big guy?

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.660
Just take out one o'
the stray cats!

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.490
That white one over there!

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:35.130
Or no, maybe the gray one
aaaargh, I can't decide!

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.360
My my my I just remembered
that when stray cat is in attack

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.430
mode, you can't target
any other monster.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.490
So wait, but I mean, if.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.630
Interesting tactic this poses
a bit of a dilemma.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.030
Huh

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.990
both of her monsters
are stray cats.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.360
Well, yeah, and?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.130
If you target one, the other
one will leap in and become the

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.560
target of your attack

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.060
this cycle will go on
and on and on.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.660
So basically I can't attack!

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.990
Ahh, this isn't good

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.760
Uh I don't know
what to do here.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.330
Hehe

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.730
yuma I think I know a
method that will get us

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.230
out of this situation.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.590
Stop talking!

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.430
I'm trying to concentrate.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.390
I know I can do this.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.030
I know I've got what
it takes to save Tori.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.160
Maybe if well, no, 'cause then

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.760
I bet your
thinking about her!

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.290
Yeah!

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.690
All right! I think I got it!

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.490
I've got a little flip
Flap spell card action for

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.690
you and your strays!!

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.360
with this card, I can now
change the battle mode of

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.160
one monster on the field!

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.330
Huh

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.090
Let's go with the white one.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.030
Alright, Archer -- You're up!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.730
Target that gray one!

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.230
[Roar]

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.430
my Kitty!

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.560
The stray cat's ability
was dependent on it

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.390
being in attack mode.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.360
So by forcing one of them into
defense mode, yuma made the

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.730
other one vulnerable.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.690
That was the suggestion
I was going to make.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.490
Perhaps it is better
that he came up with

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.390
that move on his own...

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.660
cat! You're gona wish you
hadn't messed with my friend

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.130
Tori! Just you wait!

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.690
It's not fair.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.690
I'm standing here
right in front of you.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.160
And all you care about is Tori?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.990
Just forget about her!

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.430
You're supposed to
be focusing on me!

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.290
Uhh, what is with you?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.160
Before you even think of making
another move, I'm activating a

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.460
spell card!

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.190
Since you destroyed my cut Lil'
stray cat, now I can use the

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.460
mysterious cat TRANSFORMATION
spell card and summon

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.390
monster cat!

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.160
Whoa!

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.760
That thing is freaky!

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.730
When Monster cat comes to the
field it comes raring to

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.730
destroy all your weak monsters!

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.060
And what makes this such a
purrrr-Fect combo is that for

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.990
every monster that monster
cat destroys you get hit for

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.690
800 points of damage!

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.230
Ahh

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.990
that's what you get for
thinking about

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.030
Tori while we're dueling.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.990
Yeah, sure, lesson learned

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.330
you've got my undivided
attention. I end my turn.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.760
I hope you like
my kitties' tricks!

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.230
Cause monster cat's
got another one!

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.030
Once every turn, it can rescue
one stray cat from my deck or my

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.130
graveyard and place
it in my hand

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.090
and once it's in my hand, I can
summon it out to play!

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.190
She has three level 1
monsters on her field

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.360
are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.530
She's busting out
her number card.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.690
I overlay my two stray
cats and my monster cat

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.430
to build the overlay network!

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.260
I xyz summon
TWIN TAIL cat lady!

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.360
Careful!

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.060
She's a little testy!

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.990
[Roar]

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.990
why did she not
use the number card?

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.490
I now activate Twin tail
cat's special ability!

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.260
Once a turn, by using an overlay
unit, she can increase her

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.760
attack power by 800 points!

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.990
Whoa!..

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.460
are you serious??

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.130
you've got two more
overlay units left, so um...

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.060
if you use both of those,
we're talking uhh.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.460
Sixteen-Hundred more gives
her thirty-Four hundred.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.390
Ahh, I would've gotten it!

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.360
It's been fun
dueling with you. Hehe

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.690
perhaps she does
not have a number

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.490
I don't know who you are!

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.630
But you're a great duelist!

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.190
You think I'm?

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.630
You haven't seen anything yet.
Watch this!

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.690
Stray cats shouldn't have to
live in Dirty alleys!

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.430
Meow!

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.630
I'm gonna activate the
CAT world Field spell!

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.530
Whoa, did we just teleport?

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.430
Welcome to cat world.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.990
A world where cats can play in
the grass and lie in the sun.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.730
For them, it's a Paradise for
you, it's a nightmare.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.690
Here in cat world All cats
gain attack points equal to

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.360
their original attack points!

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.990
That cat lady just keeps
getting more powerful

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.760
I've got your attention
now, don't I? Huh.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.730
Go, twin tail cat lady -
Attack yuma directly!

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.230
[Roar]

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.130
ahh.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.990
I was hoping you would do that!

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.760
- So I could do this!

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.460
I can activate pixie gong
when I take a direct attack.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.060
And its sound wakes up
a pixie in my deck and

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.130
summons it in attack mode!

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.630
Joe the pixie,
report to the front line!

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.760
Aww, he's precious!...

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.430
Let's see what he can do.
Your move

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.730
man, this is a great duel!

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.990
You're awesome!

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.490
Yeah, you think so?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.660
You bet!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.160
It's just.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.990
Huh

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.490
it's just so nice to hear you
say that because, well

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.060
in the real world,
there's this boy.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.760
He doesn't even know I exist.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.230
We see each other all
the time, but he just

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.030
looks right through me.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.430
This guy sounds like
kind of a jerk.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.060
I tried playing all sorts of
little tricks on him, just to

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.390
get him to say something to me,
but it didn't work.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.130
I'm just so shy.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.760
I wish I could walk
right up to him and

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.160
tell him that I like him.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.330
You should!

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.130
Huh?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.030
He'll never know how you feel
if you keep it to yourself!

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.090
Just go for it!

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.630
Put it out there for
the world to see!

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.330
You're right, yuma. Ahah

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.390
I'm gonna do it!

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.690
Im gonna go for it!

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.130
Ok, here it goes!

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.090
Yuma, I think you're really...!

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.660
now,it's my turn now.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.030
I draw!

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.490
Oh?

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.760
It's time to
bring out acorno!

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.230
See, by sending pinecono to my
graveyard, I can bring this

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.330
little guy to the field!

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.460
And now pinecono's special
ability can activate!

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.090
When he gets sent
to the graveyard,

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.160
I can summon him straight out!

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.660
Hang on a second, don't...

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.760
alrighty, here we go!

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.990
Now I can xyz summon, too!

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.530
I overlay my three level 1
monsters in order to build the

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.030
overlay network!!

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.590
say hello to baby tiragon!

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.460
For my next move,
I'll be summoning

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.090
gagaga magician!

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.430
I activate gagaga
magician's special ability,

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.360
so now he's a level 1!

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.730
And next, I activate baby
tiragon's ability!

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.990
By Using one overlay Unit Baby
tiragon empowers a level 1

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.560
monster to attack you directly!

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.430
Yuma, wait, I
wanted to say that--

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.560
Gagaga magician Attack!!

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.190
go gagaga magic!

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.060
Ahh...

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.590
I am on a roll

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.630
baby tiragon Attack
twin Tail cat lady!

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.130
Do what?

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.060
It does not have
enough attack points.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.160
I got that covered!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.690
Don't you worry!

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.230
Cause From my hand, I'm
activating the ego boost spell!

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.330
It gives my monster 1000
attack points during battle!

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.360
So baby tiragon's
getting a power up!

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.160
Yuma, wait I just wanna say

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.530
but!

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.290
The fun doesn't stop there.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.660
Cause ego boost LOWERS
cat lady's attack

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.260
point back to their
original total!

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.730
Yuma, I think that you're...

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.060
I am seriously
feeling the flow!!

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.390
go, baby tiragon, time
to bring us home!

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.760
Baby stream!

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.330
[Roar]

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.190

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.760
All right!

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.530
I did it!

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.690
She did not possess
a number card.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.630
You okay?

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.630
A deal's a deal.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.460
This is the part where you tell
me where Tori is cat.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.990
Alright yuma.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.730
Green light green light

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.330
red light!

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.490
Hehe, you guys are great!

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.530

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.630

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.330

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.430

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.560
haha

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760
the cats wanted me to play with
them and they were so cute,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.660
I couldn't refuse.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.330
I just lost track of time!

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.390
Yuma, how long are you
going to stay mad at me!?

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.630
I am not mad!

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.160
Well Ya coulda fooled me.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.290
Umm...

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.030
umm...

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.360
do you need something?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.990
Just, um good morning.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.990
What's up!

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.030
Okay who was that?

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.130
Don't be rude, bronk!

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.390
That girl's in our class.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.760
Her name's, uhhh
think it's, uhhh

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760
it's Cathy.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.690
She goes by "Cat." She and I
dueled the other day!

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.360
Uh! You did?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.660
You- You didn't tell me.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.730
By the way did you
ever find out who was

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.630
pulling those pranks on you?

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.630
Nope, that Trail has
officially gone cold.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.090
So it's a hopeless
case, just like you.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.530
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.990
Observation number 11.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.690
It seems that yuma is totally
and utterly incapable of

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.990
understanding the
females of his species.
