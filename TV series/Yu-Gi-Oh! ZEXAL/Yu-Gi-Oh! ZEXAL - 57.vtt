WEBVTT

00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.125
(Mr. Heartland)
If you're just
joining us here at

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:03.725
the World
Duel Carnival,

00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:06.391
please help us extend
a warm congratulations

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:09.291
to Kite on his
outstanding victory!

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:12.825
He along with Vetrix are the
first semi-finalists to emerge.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.525
Now there's only room for
two more to advance.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.591
Who will it be?

00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:18.991
But the bigger
question is,

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:20.625
why am I here
jabbering when

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.325
we've got so much
action on the way?

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.658
What kind of action?

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.125
(All)
Dueling action!

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.425
I am sensing a powerful
pulse of energy

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.325
coming from
up ahead, Yuma.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.158
Energy?

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:41.358
Correct.

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:44.791
I believe it may be the
power of the crest.

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.925
That could mean
Vetrix is close?

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:48.791
That is quite
feasible.

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:50.958
(Yuma)
Well what do you say
we find out for sure?

(Mr. Heartland)
It's time to turn
up the heat!

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:56.131
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.965
may I present to you
the Magma Field!

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:01.805
And it looks like
Quattro and Shark

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:05.038
are headed there
for a fiery faceoff!

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.171
Shark is so dreamy.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.405
I finally caught
up with you.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.938
You get tired
of runnin'?

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:22.005
From you?

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:23.505
Please...

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:26.705
You played right
into my hands.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:27.971
I wasn't running away,

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:29.438
I was luring
you right here,

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:32.405
to the scorching hot
Magma field,

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:35.338
where you are at an
overwhelming disadvantage.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.471
You see, your deck's
full of Water monsters,

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.938
and water and fire
don't exactly mix!

00:02:42.738 --> 00:02:44.205
All right,
Quattro!

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.071
Take a bite
out of Shark!

00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.238
She wouldn't
be so gung-ho

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:49.405
if she knew what Quattro
was really like.

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:50.671
Yeah I'll say.

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.305
In the end, Quattro
is just a lying,

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.638
self-serving snake!

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:57.771
Let's duel!

00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.571
I'm jumpin' in
and going first!

00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:01.911
I draw!

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:04.111
And if you think this Magma
field's gonna burn me,

00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:05.911
then you got another
thing comin'!

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:09.111
I activate the spell
Plate Salvage!

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:10.545
And due to its effect,

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.411
the field spell that makes
this place so scorching

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:15.911
is stopped for
two turns!

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:26.411
Check it out, Tori.

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.878
It's Shark
versus Quattro!

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.345
This I gotta see!

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:30.978
Yuma.

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:33.611
How nice of
you to join us.

00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.178
I thought this was
the Magma Field.

00:03:36.178 --> 00:03:38.945
Yeah, what gives--
It's freezing here.

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:40.511
Achoo!

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.978
Very shrewd.

00:03:41.978 --> 00:03:43.445
Shark must have ceased
the field's effects

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:46.178
by activating
a spell card.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:49.711
How I've waited
for this.

00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:53.278
Quattro, at long last
squaring off against Shark.

00:03:53.278 --> 00:03:56.445
I set the wheels in motion
for this duel long ago.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:00.118
You can be quite sure I'll be
keeping my eye on this one!

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:07.285
I summon
Tripod Fish!

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:18.551
Now that there's a
Fish-Type monster on my field,

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.418
I can summon
Shark Stickers!

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:23.785
So come on out
and make a splash!

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:31.351
Shark's got a pair
of Level 3 monsters!

00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:33.351
Bet I know
what's next!

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:37.018
I overlay Level 3
Tripod Fish and Shark Stickers

00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:39.518
in order to build the
Overlay Network!

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:43.318
I Xyz Summon Submersible
Carrier Aero Shark!

00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:51.118
I activate its
special ability!

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:53.051
By using one
Overlay Unit,

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:57.851
you take 400 points of damage
for every card in my hand,

00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.451
and I'm holding
three cards.

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.425
So that means you're about
to lose 1,200 life points!

00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:11.325
Well done!

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:14.091
Shark dealt a big-time blow
on his very first turn!

00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:16.591
Quattro's been
Shark attacked!

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:19.658
That's right Shark!

00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:20.658
Aww, yeah!

00:05:20.658 --> 00:05:21.891
Amazing move!

00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:24.191
I can't wait to see
you take Quattro out!

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.925
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:31.691
You think you're
hot stuff

00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:34.791
summoning an Xyz Monster
on your first turn, huh?

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:36.725
Well, I was counting
on that, Shark!

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:38.991
Now I draw.

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:41.158
You see, when you summoned
your Xyz Monster,

00:05:41.158 --> 00:05:43.558
you put my master
plan in motion!

00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:45.391
Since I have no
monsters on my field

00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:47.358
and you have
an Xyz Monster,

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:51.491
I can now summon my Level 8
Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll!

00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:53.291
And I'll follow
that up by summoning

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.691
Gimmick Puppet
Gear Changer!

00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.491
This little beauty
becomes the same Level

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.898
as Gimmick Puppet
Magnet Doll!

00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:04.365
Now do your thing,
Gear Changer!

00:06:08.531 --> 00:06:10.665
This isn't looking too good
for Shark right now.

00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:12.465
I hope he can turn
things around.

00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:14.998
I overlay Level 8 Gimmick
Puppet Magnet Doll

00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:17.198
and Gimmick Puppet
Gear Changer!

00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:19.131
With these
two monsters,

00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.265
I build the Overlay
Network and Xyz Summon!

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:28.665
Say hello to
Number 15:

00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:31.465
Gimmick Puppet
Giant Grinder!

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:43.682
That's scary!

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:44.982
Yeah, you said it!

00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:46.716
That's the monster that
put Bronk and Caswell

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:49.382
in a world of hurt!

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:52.749
You are way out
of your league

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.956
and soon you'll
be sunk, Shark!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.489
And unfortunately
for you,

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:58.989
this is just
the beginning.

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:03.222
Quattro means
business!

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.289
Yeah, I'll say.

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.689
Get ready...

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.722
Oh no-- not again!

00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:12.322
What on earth is happening
with the video feed?

00:07:12.322 --> 00:07:14.056
More technical
difficulties?

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:17.056
How disappointing-- it couldn't
have happened at a worse time.

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:18.789
This duel was really
heating up!

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:22.156
Who's doing this?

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:26.356
A duel of this
consequence

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:28.556
should have the
dignity of privacy,

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:30.689
So I took care
of the cameras.

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:32.256
Ah, the bitter
hatred

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:34.422
between Quattro and
Shark runs very deep.

00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:36.256
And now without
any prying eyes,

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.456
I can do
as I please.

00:07:38.456 --> 00:07:42.356
I activate Gimmick Puppet Giant
Grinder's special ability!

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.656
It instantly destroys
your Aero Shark,

00:07:44.656 --> 00:07:47.356
and you take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.829
Oh no!

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:07.996
Oh, are you okay?

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:10.029
If he is, he won't
be for long,

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.929
because now my Giant Grinder
can attack him directly!

00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:15.396
I don't think
so, Quattro!

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.796
I activate
Bubble Bringer!

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:20.596
This card negates your
monster's direct attack!

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:23.996
What a sweet move!

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:26.096
Shark, you may have
stopped my monster,

00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:28.662
But one thing you can't
stop is the climate!

00:08:28.662 --> 00:08:31.629
You see, Plate Salvage's
effect ends this turn,

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:34.329
so the temperature
is going way up!

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:36.296
And the chance of you
making a comeback

00:08:36.296 --> 00:08:38.629
is going way down!

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:45.396
Whoa!

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:50.062
It went from frosty
to fiery just like that.

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:51.629
This is bad
for Shark.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:54.069
His luck
has turned.

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.369
I don't need a field
spell to beat you!

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:58.836
Let me demonstrate!

00:08:58.836 --> 00:09:02.036
My turn-- I draw!

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:04.769
I summon Hammer Shark!

00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:11.269
And I activate Bubble
Bringer's effect!

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:12.669
I send this to
the graveyard

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:15.502
to summon
Tripod Fish back!

00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:19.236
And since it
was Special Summoned,

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.602
Tripod Fish
gains one level!

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:25.802
You fool!

00:09:25.802 --> 00:09:27.869
Did you forget that this
field's relentless heat

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:29.169
makes it near
impossible

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.936
for Water Attribute
monsters to duel?

00:09:31.936 --> 00:09:34.569
Your monster stands
no chance here!

00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:36.802
Let me show you
what I mean!

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:47.302
What?

00:09:47.302 --> 00:09:48.669
How'd that happen?

00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:51.636
Shark simply activated
a trap card, Yuma.

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:54.709
What's that?

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:57.642
It's the trap card
Adapt to Adversity!

00:09:57.642 --> 00:09:59.142
It stops spell
and trap cards

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:01.942
from destroying my
water monster!

00:10:01.942 --> 00:10:03.176
Know what that means?

00:10:03.176 --> 00:10:05.976
My monster Tripod Fish
stays on the field.

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:07.209
Oh wow!

00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:08.942
Shark is the man!

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.776
If you mean that his dueling
is unmatched, then I concur.

00:10:15.609 --> 00:10:16.642
<i>Quattro,</i>

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:18.142
<i>Today I get to
pay you back</i>

00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:19.542
<i>for all that
you've done!</i>

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:21.076
<i>Setting me up
and getting me</i>

00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:23.209
<i>disqualified from
the nationals,</i>

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:25.876
<i>putting my sister
in the hospital!</i>

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:30.442
I will defeat you Quattro,
no matter what the cost!

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:32.209
This could get ugly!

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:34.009
Thanks to Bubble
Bringer's effect,

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.776
when I Xyz Summon, Tripod
Fish counts as two monsters!

00:10:39.942 --> 00:10:43.542
So I overlay two Tripod Fish
and Hammer Shark!

00:10:44.742 --> 00:10:46.109
With these
three monsters,

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:49.509
I build the Overlay
Network and Xyz Summon

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:52.349
Number 32:
Shark Drake!

00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:09.212
Shark summoned
out Shark Drake!

00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:11.412
I've seen
that before!

00:11:11.412 --> 00:11:14.846
Yes, that is the Number Card
Trey gave to Shark,

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:17.546
at my command,
of course.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.912
All is proceeding
as I had planned.

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:22.512
Excellent.

00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:24.712
Now Shark, give in
to your anger so that

00:11:24.712 --> 00:11:26.912
Shark Drake may
take hold.

00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:30.612
That Number,
it belonged to Trey.

00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:33.879
Did Vetrix use Trey to pass
the Number to Shark?

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:36.545
Has he been plotting this
duel the whole time?

00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:39.979
Why, yes-- didn't
I mention it?

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:40.979
Vetrix!

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:42.579
Why wasn't I told?

00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:44.612
Telling you would
only compromise

00:11:44.612 --> 00:11:47.619
the security of
my plan, Quattro.

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:50.719
And who knows who
you might tell?

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:54.452
You see everyone has
their role to play.

00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.852
Trey and Quinton.

00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:58.252
Even you, my boy.

00:11:58.252 --> 00:11:59.452
That so?

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:01.752
Then what's
my role, huh?

00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:03.219
To drive Shark's rage,

00:12:03.219 --> 00:12:06.152
making his anger soar
to new heights!

00:12:06.152 --> 00:12:08.319
And the angrier
Shark gets,

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:10.985
the quicker the
Number consumes him.

00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:12.352
Let me get
this straight.

00:12:12.352 --> 00:12:15.219
you just used me to
make Shark angry

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:17.519
so he'd summon
Shark Drake?

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:19.985
That's about it!

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:22.352
Now go!

00:12:22.352 --> 00:12:24.685
Attack Gimmick Puppet
Giant Grinder,

00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:26.352
Shark Drake!

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:32.685
I activate Shark Drake's
special ability.

00:12:34.852 --> 00:12:37.252
I use one Overlay
Unit to summon

00:12:37.252 --> 00:12:40.185
Gimmick Puppet Giant
Grinder back to your field.

00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:42.752
And lower its attack
points by a thousand!

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:43.752
Why would Shark give

00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:45.625
Quattro back
his monster?

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:47.325
Um, well,
that's 'cause...

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:48.592
Shark Drake
can attack

00:12:48.592 --> 00:12:50.725
Quattro's Gimmick
Puppet Giant Grinder

00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.792
a second time because of
its special ability.

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:55.459
Exactly-- what
he said!

00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:57.092
What who said?

00:12:57.092 --> 00:12:59.159
Quattro has 1,500
life points left.

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:02.059
If this move works,
Shark'll win the duel!

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:10.059
I summon Gimmick Puppet
Twilight Joker from my hand!

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:20.392
I can summon this monster
by banishing Giant Grinder.

00:13:20.392 --> 00:13:22.692
Sorry your plan was
cut short, Shark!

00:13:25.359 --> 00:13:26.492
(Vetrix)
Ooh.

00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.559
That was close
Quattro.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.959
A most impressive
countermeasure.

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.425
Yes, most
impressive indeed.

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:35.892
But it remains to be seen
if your quick thinking

00:13:35.892 --> 00:13:39.325
was a fluke or a harbinger
of things to come.

00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:40.892
Be quiet, Vetrix!

00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:45.198
Did he just
say "Vetrix"?

00:13:45.198 --> 00:13:46.465
Are you here,
Vetrix?

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:48.598
Don't hide from me!

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:51.432
Peek-a-boo!

00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:53.665
Vetrix is here!

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:54.832
Not quite.

00:13:54.832 --> 00:13:57.198
It seems Vetrix is using
the power of the crest

00:13:57.198 --> 00:13:59.465
to speak with
us from afar.

00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:01.965
(Vetrix)
How very astute
of you, Astral.

00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:04.098
Vetrix, Why are
you spying on

00:14:04.098 --> 00:14:06.232
Quattro and
Shark's duel?

00:14:06.232 --> 00:14:07.898
What is
your purpose?

00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:11.032
I demand that
you answer me!

00:14:11.032 --> 00:14:13.232
Well, since you
asked so nicely,

00:14:13.232 --> 00:14:15.432
I suppose I'll share
my plot with you all,

00:14:15.432 --> 00:14:17.298
as there is no
stopping me now.

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:25.099
I intend for the Number
Shark Drake to consume Shark.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.899
That will make him
prone to my influence,

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.632
and I can use him
to finish Dr. Faker.

00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:31.932
No way!

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:33.232
Think again!

00:14:33.232 --> 00:14:35.865
You're not using me for
anything, understand?

00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:37.699
Oh, I beg to
disagree.

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.799
I can be quite
convincing.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:42.732
You will be my puppet,
doing exactly as I wish,

00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:45.439
powerless to defy me.

00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:46.739
But why, Vetrix?

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:47.839
Why have you
chosen Shark?

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:49.139
Why not me?

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.039
I am the better
duelist!

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:53.572
Please, Vetrix,
this is a mistake!

00:14:53.572 --> 00:14:55.405
Let me take on
Dr. Faker!

00:14:55.405 --> 00:14:58.539
I tire of hearing myself
repeat this to you, Quattro.

00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:01.739
Each person has their own
role to fill in my plans.

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:04.639
But to be quite clear, you
are not the stronger duelist.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.005
That honor goes to Shark.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:07.005
You're wrong!

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:08.472
I will never
accept that!

00:15:08.472 --> 00:15:11.605
I will show you who the
stronger duelist is!

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:13.472
I will prove that
you misjudged me

00:15:13.472 --> 00:15:15.705
by beating him
in this duel!

00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:16.939
It's my turn!

00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:18.205
I draw!

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:21.272
And now, Shark, I activate
the dreaded spell card

00:15:21.272 --> 00:15:23.905
Gimmick Puppet Ritual
from my hand!

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.105
With this card,

00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:28.739
I summon a Gimmick Puppet
from my graveyard.

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:34.172
Now return, Gimmick
Puppet Magnet Doll!

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:43.172
I overlay Level 8 Gimmick
Puppet Twilight Joker

00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:46.312
and Gimmick Puppet
Magnet Doll!

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:51.279
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:55.779
And Xyz Summon Number 40:
Gimmick Puppet of Strings!

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:09.512
And if that's got you worried,
prepare to be petrified

00:16:09.512 --> 00:16:12.312
because now I equip
Gimmick Puppet of Strings

00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:14.812
with the spell
String of Destiny!

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:18.979
Do you know
what that means?

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.212
I send the top card in
my deck to the graveyard!

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:23.179
If it's a monster
card I can attack

00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:26.879
the same number of times
as that monster's level!

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:28.945
Your monster
won't be destroyed.

00:16:28.945 --> 00:16:32.679
No, you alone will
take all the damage!

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:34.045
Look at that!

00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:38.045
I drew level 8 Gimmick
Puppet Dreary Doll!

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:41.712
Do the math.

00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:45.685
It means I can attack your Shark
Drake eight times in a row!

00:16:52.314 --> 00:16:54.214
Yes Shark,
it's true!

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:59.114
I can attack your Shark Drake
eight times in a row!

00:16:59.114 --> 00:17:00.447
This is real bad.

00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:02.447
Eight consecutive
attacks?

00:17:02.447 --> 00:17:05.914
And now, attack Gimmick Puppet
with Celestial Slash!

00:17:16.547 --> 00:17:17.814
Shark!

00:17:17.814 --> 00:17:19.681
Due to String of
Destiny's effect,

00:17:19.681 --> 00:17:21.247
Shark's monster
will remain

00:17:21.247 --> 00:17:22.947
as he endures
all the damage

00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:24.847
from the
consecutive attacks.

00:17:24.847 --> 00:17:27.847
Now, Gimmick Puppet,
attack it again!

00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:37.054
Don't stop Gimmick Puppet,
keep attacking!

00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:44.554
I can't watch.

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:45.687
Quattro!

00:17:45.687 --> 00:17:47.454
What you're
doing is wrong!

00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:48.854
Dueling has
nothing to do

00:17:48.854 --> 00:17:50.787
with giving in
to your anger.

00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:53.187
Oh, to the contrary...

00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:59.487
I-- I can't move!

00:17:59.487 --> 00:18:01.021
Yuma!

00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:03.887
So sorry, but I can't let
you interfere with this duel.

00:18:03.887 --> 00:18:06.921
Just sit tight, relax,
and enjoy the show!

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:10.454
Quattro, stop!

00:18:10.454 --> 00:18:11.921
You're hurting him!

00:18:11.921 --> 00:18:14.687
Yeah, cut it out, dueling's
not about causing pain!

00:18:14.687 --> 00:18:16.354
I can't say I agree.

00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:18.187
My only concern is
that Shark may be

00:18:18.187 --> 00:18:20.754
getting used to
the punishment.

00:18:20.754 --> 00:18:22.987
In case you're
not keeping count,

00:18:22.987 --> 00:18:25.587
this is my fifth attack!

00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:27.654
Quattro, dueling's
about competition,

00:18:27.654 --> 00:18:29.821
friendly competition,

00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:31.387
emphasis on "friendly."

00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:33.487
Dueling's about friends!

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.954
Yuma you are
just like him.

00:18:35.954 --> 00:18:39.327
Just like your
father, Kazuma.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.394
You're both misguided.

00:18:41.394 --> 00:18:42.494
Quiet!

00:18:42.494 --> 00:18:43.661
He would prattle
on about dueling

00:18:43.661 --> 00:18:47.894
being about friendship
and other such nonsense.

00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:50.127
Don't you dare talk
about my father!

00:18:50.127 --> 00:18:53.661
Oh my, I think I hit
a nerve, didn't I, Yuma?

00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.161
Am I making you angry?

00:18:55.161 --> 00:18:57.694
Excellent.

00:18:57.694 --> 00:18:59.061
Your anger will
deliver you

00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:03.727
further and further into my
clutches, so stay angry!

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.394
Do you have
something to say?

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:06.694
Well, out with it Yuma.

00:19:06.694 --> 00:19:08.261
Let's hear what's
on your mind.

00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:11.027
Everyone whose life you
touch suffers, Vetrix!

00:19:11.027 --> 00:19:13.961
You tormented poor Dextra
in the Jungle field!

00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:15.361
And you used
Trey and Quinton

00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.561
as tools for your
own revenge!

00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:18.994
Yes, Yuma!

00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:21.627
Let your anger for me
burn like a wildfire.

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.927
I can sense your
anger growing.

00:19:23.927 --> 00:19:25.494
It's so delightful!

00:19:25.494 --> 00:19:27.527
Very soon,
you'll be mine.

00:19:27.527 --> 00:19:28.961
Enough!

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:31.394
Did you enjoy those attacks
as much as I did?

00:19:34.127 --> 00:19:35.494
My attacks are over.

00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:37.294
But your punishment's
just begun.

00:19:37.294 --> 00:19:40.834
I activate Gimmick Puppet of
Strings' special ability!

00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:42.634
I use one Overlay Unit

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:45.967
to put a String
Counter on Shark Drake.

00:20:05.967 --> 00:20:07.434
At the end of
your next turn,

00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:09.701
the String Counter will
destroy Shark Drake.

00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:11.634
And you Shark, will
be taking damage

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:13.901
equal to its
attack points!

00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.101
With that,
I end my turn,

00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:18.434
and your chances
of winning!

00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:21.301
Shark!

00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:22.301
Get up!

00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:23.434
Don't quit now!

00:20:23.434 --> 00:20:26.234
Shark, you can't
let Quattro win!

00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:29.834
Oh no...

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:31.467
Looks like Shark's
down for the count!

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.801
Shark!
