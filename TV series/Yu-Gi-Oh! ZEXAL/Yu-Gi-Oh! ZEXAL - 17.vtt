00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.530
FORTUNO: Your fate
has been sealed.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.090
It is useless to try to write
what was already written

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.530
by the stars many years ago.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.190
You believed that you
would achieve greatness

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.690
but you're nothing more
than a pawn in a game

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.660
beyond your comprehension.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.830
And now you will give me that
which I seek.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.690
Man: This, isn't over yet!

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.190
Number 16: Shock master!

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.090
Attack!

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.990
Hey, who are you?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.430
Tell me!

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.390
You need not worry your hapless
self about who I am, but who I

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.730
have sworn allegiance to.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.060
And who's that?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.330
I serve at the pleasure of my
great master, Kite!

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.990
It is for him that I take not
only your number card,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.390
but your very being!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.260
Your bidding has been done, my
master - Another number

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.190
card has been obtained.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.990
That's right!

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.130
Someone Powered up his deck!

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.390
Boom!

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.130
How do you feel today, my
awesome little darlings?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.930
Feel like getting out there and
takin' some fools down!?

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.860
why do you look so blue?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.930
Astral: I suppose it is just my
pigmentation.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
Or perhaps, something to do
with light refraction.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.090
Uh, whaddya talking about?

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.530
I mean, why do you look sad?

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.530
TORI: Hey, yuma!

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.660
Uh

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.760
what's up, guys!

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.190
Something is going down.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.690
That's what's up.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.490
Come on, we need to
have a serious chat!

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.030
This doesn't sound good

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.160
whaa!

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.890
What happened to these people!?

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.330
BRONK: Nobody knows much!

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.530
CASWELL: They all went missing
at one point and ever since they

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.930
were found, they seemed to have
aged or something and they just

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.660
stare off into space and-

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.730
drool!

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190
They're like zombies!

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.230
Yuma, these people only
have one thing in common

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.690
they're duelists.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.160
And before they went missing,
every single one of them had

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.630
found a number card!

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.660
Uh.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.930
Seriously?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.160
In the end yuma, since you
possess a number card,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.630
it stands to reason that
you are in danger.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.230
Naah!

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.690
I'm sure it's just a
big co-Eenk-Ee-Dink!

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.160
Anyone do the math homework?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.790
You're hiding something!

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.790
What do you know, yuma!?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.690
are number cards, like,
you know, dangerous?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.760
I dunno.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.830
Why would they be?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.590
Don't play dumb!

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.530
I, uh, I gotta go
to the bathroom!

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.330
Wait up!

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.490
What's he hiding?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.160
Yuma

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.030
Why are you keeping the
truth from your friends?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.230
I dunno, I guess, I guess I
don't want them to get involved

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.230
with all the Kite stuff, the
less they know, the better.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.090
I see.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.430
Perhaps you are right

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.530
I guess all those people
in the news were people

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.430
that Kite hunted down.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.990
Well, maybe we should hunt him
down so that we can go ahead and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.530
put him in his place!

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.230
And how do you propose we,
"put him in his place?"

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.390
are you telling me you're
still scared of that jerk?

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.860
Astral!

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.990
If you wanna get your memories
back, then sooner or later,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.260
we're gonna have to defeat Kite
and get those number cards!

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.990
And what happens if we lose?

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
Kite gets to add your soul to
his growing collection and I

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.030
vanish away to who knows where!

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.060
That's why we won't
lose, astral!

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.860
CATHY: Uh, hello yuma.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.030
Oh man!

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.060
You scared me.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.460
What are you doing up here, cat?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.460
You remembered my name

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.130
um, who were you talking to?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.790
You know what, I've gotta
go to the bathroom.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.890
See ya later.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.160
Bye-Bye, cat!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.860
Okay, well that was weird.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.760
Master Kite, I present to you my
latest Conquest,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.090
number 16: Shock master.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.290
Now let us find out
what fate holds next.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.990
I bring forth my
fortuneteller's deck

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.460
the deck is showing me
the signs, stray lambs

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.960
in the dark.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.160
Their Shepherd will come
looking for them, he will

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.090
bring us another number

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.360
See ya later!

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.930
Hang on, yuma!

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.490
I gotta do some
shopping for grandma!

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.230
Bye!

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.960
Argh, escaped again!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.730
Me and Caswell got a
little idea, Tori.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.890
"The Super secret number card
investigation Club?"

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.060
that's right!

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.590
Although, now that I
hear you say it, I guess

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.530
it's kind of a mouthful

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.460
the point remains - If yuma
isn't going to talk about number

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.360
cards, then we'll have to
uncover the mystery!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.230
FLIP: Did someone say mystery!

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.490
I love a good mystery!

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.630
I am requesting
membership in your club!

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.030
Sure, flip!

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.890
Hey, in fact - You had a number
card at one point, right?

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.390
I did!

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.260
And I would be more than happy
to tell you what I

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.660
remember about my experience!

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.130
So tell us!

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.590
What I remember is
absolutely nothing!

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.390
That's a big help!

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.390
Um.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.760
Hello.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.530
I would like to join your
investigation club, as well.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.730
Uh, okay,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.960
earlier, I saw yuma
talking with himself.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.330
Oh, yeah, he does that.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.130
What was he talking about?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.730
Numbers and, and flying kites.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.830
Flyin' kites?

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.330
What's that about?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.090
Maybe number card people use
kites to signal each other

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.490
whatever!

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.830
Let's split up and
track down some leads!

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.960
Sounds Good!

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.330
We can do this!

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.730
We're the super secret number
card investigation club!

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.830
Alright!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.990
Let's go!

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.190
They say dogs are the best
animals for tracking things down

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.930
let's prove them wrong!

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.460
There is certainly a lot of
mystery surrounding these number

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.530
cards, but - in the end,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.990
everything has
a logical explanation.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360
A mystery is just a puzzle.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.590
A puzzle has pieces.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.830
Pieces fit together, but how?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.360
And what if you don't
have all the pieces?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.630
Or the box that tells you
what the puzzle is even

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.630
supposed to even look LIKE

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.790
very curious

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.890
excuse me, uh

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.630
shark: Why are you running
around and asking people

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.160
about number cards?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.890
Oh, hey shark .Do you know
anything about number cards?

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.890
I know that they're bad news,
and that you shouldn't be asking

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.690
random Strangers about them.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.060
Whaddya mean?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.490
Why not?

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.530
This isn't a game that you wanna
be playing, Tori,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.690
leave it alone.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.660
Go home.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.160
Shark

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.460
anyone else have any luck?

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.530
Not me.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.890
Not me, either.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.530
Yeah, I got nothin'.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.360
in the end, this mystery may
remain a mystery.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.290
Have no fear!

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.260
Flip is here!

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.130
Sometimes you've just gotta look
in unlikely places, which is

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.130
exactly what I did!

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.090
Uh

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.160
What is this place, flip?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.190
I was told that this mansion
belongs to a world-Renowned

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.630
fortune teller!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.060
A what?

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.190
A fortune teller is somebody Who
is magical and all-knowing!

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.290
And what have we here, stray
little lambs looking for

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.960
answers and guidance?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.560
I have been expecting you,
follow me and I will lead you

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.930
towards the enlightenment
you all are seeking.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.390
I got a bad feeling about this.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.830
Probably the burrito you
had for lunch.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.060
This place is like a museum.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.360
Yeah, a haunted museum.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.690
Shh!

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.290
Where's he taking us?

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.790
Uh, nice place.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.230
I know why you're here.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.260
You seek to gain knowledge about
something that is troubling you.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.730
How did you know!?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.730
I see everything!

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.160
What you're looking for is

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.560
let's see

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.560
I'm seeing a rectangle,
something thin, I'm seeing

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.730
a card!

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.930
Not just a normal card, a
powerful card, it's, no, not one

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.130
specific card, a type of card,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.260
yeah, we're looking for!

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.290
Shh

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.090
I'm seeing visions of, numbers!

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.730
How does he know that? We
never mentioned anything

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.260
about no numbers!

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.160
It's got to be some
kind of trickery.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.530
Show some respect!

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.690
There's no trickery
in fortune-Telling!

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.330
So, what else do you see?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.390
Do you see anything
more about these numbers?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.130
These numbers contain
a great evil

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.590
evil?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.830
They seek to possess those who
hold them, they invade their

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.830
hearts and corrupt their spirits

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.230
so yuma he, he could end
up like those people we saw!

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.990
Tell me.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.030
Who is this yuma?

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.990
Our friend, he

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.130
he's got one of
the number cards.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.590
We've been worried

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.160
because he won't tell us what he
knows about it even though, we

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.560
can tell, he knows something
that he's not telling us.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.960
Unfortunately,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.630
my vision ends here.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.730
Your vision ends here

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.960
you have given me what the stars
said you would, my dear little

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.560
Lamb, my master is going to be
most grateful.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.960
Hey, Tori, let's go.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.160
Actually, I was hoping that you
could stick around a little.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.490
Cat, go get help!

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.260
Yes, go get help.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.890
Stop all the sighing!

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.460
It's really bumming me out.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.890
That does it.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.460
We're totally starting
up a quarter jar policy!

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.530
Yuma!

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.090
Cat!?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.730
you have to do something!

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.890
What exactly do you
need me to do?

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.160
It's Tori and the others, they!

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.260
They what?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.330
Spit it out!

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.390
Cat!

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.160
Cat Cannot hear you right now.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.230
Wha?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.860
What's going on with your voice?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.590
My name is fortuno.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.830
I am a seer of all things and I
bring to you a message on behalf

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.960
of my master, Kite.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.190
Kite?

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.830
Oh dear.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.860
We have your friends, yuma, if
you want to see them again,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.930
you must come to my
mansion and duel me.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.190
If you refuse my request,
then your friends will be

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.630
will be what?

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.930
They'll be

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.060
what happened?

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.590
I must have blacked
out, or something.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.760
Where is this mansion?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.160
You have to take me.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.130
Yeah, follow me.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.290
Wait!

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.960
I do not like this.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.190
We cannot simply go running
headfirst into What is

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.160
clearly some sort of ambush.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.930
Oh, well what do you
wanna do then, smart guy?

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.460
Stay here and do nothing?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.630
Astral, my friends
are in trouble!

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.830
You cannot save them if you
cannot defeat Kite.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.360
Kite is skilled beyond anyone I
have ever encountered.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.530
He is cunning and clever
in ways that elude me.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.760
There is no guarantee
that we can defeat him, yuma.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.530
So you think I should only duel
people when I have a hundred

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.930
percent chance of victory?!

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.630
that is correct.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.730
My very existence is on
the line when you duel, yuma.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.930
Why would I encourage you to
duel someone when I know

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.530
you will lose to them?

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.830
Because we!

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.260
If you run into Kite's ambush
right now, you will lose

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.690
and you will have failed to save
your friends and then I will be

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.490
you don't know
that I'll lose!

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.660
Yuma?

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.490
Forget it.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.990
It's obvious that you
don't wanna help me.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.990
Whatever.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.390
I don't need you!

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.730
Nobody Breath, nobody sneeze,
nobody panic, nobody move!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.590
Somebody save me!

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.090
Calm Down, flip!

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.130
Tori!

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.130
Bronk!

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.390
Yuma?

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.030
Whoa!

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.560
Check it out!

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.290
Hey, guys!

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.730
You ok!?

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.760
why can't we hear them?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.190
Welcome, yuma!

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.130
So glad that you could make it.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.990
Are you fortuno?

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.260
You need to let me
friends go, right now!

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.090
I will gladly release them if
you can defeat me in a duel,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.160
and I hope you don't mind, but

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.090
my master Kite
will be spectating

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.390
Kite

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.590
astral, I thought
you weren't coming

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.560
Hey, astral?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.890
Master Kite!

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.660
I, your humble servant,
will defeat this boy

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.290
and seize his number!

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.490
You think so!?

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.460
soon, your soul will
belong to my master!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.190
I don't think so pal!

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.390
Soon, you're gonna be
lying on the floor without

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.860
any life points.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.190
And I'll be leaving
with my friends.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.430
Duel disk go!

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.360
Duel Gazer Let's roll!

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.690
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.330
Let's duel!

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.890
I'll take the first move.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.690
Prepare yourself, I draw!

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.730
I summon orange shaman
in attack mode, ha!

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.630
A monster with No attack points

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.060
and with that, I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.860
Get set to get decked, pal!

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.490
I draw!

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.490
I summon gogogo golem!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.890
Aw, yeah!

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:37.430
Right now, he can deal a lotta
damage in a single strike!

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.660
I activate orange shaman's
special ability!

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.990
Since you summoned gogogo golem,
orange shaman can Usher another

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.130
shaman to my field!

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.460
Appear before me, red shaman!

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.330
Zero attack points again you
must not attack him!

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.630
What are you, nuts?

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.790
This is my moment.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.160
Openings don't get
any better than this!

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.930
Gogogo Golem attack!

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.690
I reveal the trap
dance of the guardian!

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.430
This allows me to choose one
card in your hand, and if it

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.630
just happens to be
a monster card, then your

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.960
attack will be nullified!

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.530
And I already know
what you're holding!

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.530
No you don't, it's not like
you're some kinda

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.890
psychic or something!

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.490
Yuma, he is!

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.860
You have five cards
in your hand!

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.160
There's only one monster
card among them.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.590
That would be the second
card from the right.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.360
Whoa, how did you?

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.590
At this moment dance of the
guardian sends the card I

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.690
selected to your graveyard and I
am able to draw from my deck!

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.360
No, gagaga magician!

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.390
Okay

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.360
I guess you are a psychic!

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.560
Nothing that I have learned
about the human Mind would lead

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.490
me to believe that a man is
capable of this power.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.860
Does Kite also
have this ability?

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.190
If so, stopping
him maybe impossible.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.060
I mean, seriously

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.190
how is that fair?

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.690
Now, yuma - Defend.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.290
You must fortify with
that trap in your hand!

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.460
That's all I can do for now.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.090
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.790
It is my turn, then!

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.460
I activate the
spell shaman call!

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.060
When I have two spellcasters
with Zero attack points, shaman

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.460
call grants me the
power to summon another

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.830
shaman from my deck!

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.060
I summon green shaman
to the field!

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.060
Uh-Oh

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.260
this is why he consecutively
summoned Two monsters that had

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.060
no attack points.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.460
Witness the power of those
who see beyond time!

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.430
Watch in wonder as
I overlay orange shaman,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.260
red shaman and green shaman!

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:18.490
With These three monsters, I
build the overlay network!

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:26.530
I xyz summon, number
sixteen: Shock master!

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.330
That thing is freaky looking!

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.390
Behold shock master's
special ability!

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.460
Once a turn, I can use one
overlay unit to negate the

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.890
effect of a card
type of my choosing!

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.960
Any type?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.060
That's correct, my boy, and the
card type I choose can't

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.160
be used for two turns!

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160
I can see it right now!

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.330
The exact type of
your facedown card

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.590
he knows.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.690
My vision grows clear, your
facedown card is a trap!

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.760
No way!

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:16.060
I declare that trap cards
cannot be activated!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.430
I do hope that you weren't
planning on using that

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.130
card to stop my attacks

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.490
shock master take out
gogogo golem!

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.460
Oh!

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.830
Did I forget to mention?

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.390
Your friends' safety
depends on you.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.230
The more life points you lose

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:53.030
the more the rock on which
they stand will crumble!

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.860
Not cool!

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.490
Are you prepared to
bow before my power and

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.030
before my master, Kite!?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.430
and now your soul
and number cards

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.030
will be mine!

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.430
Galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.530
Prepare to attack!

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.530
Is this it?!

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.730
I am afraid so

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.230
farewell

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:28.160
this feeling I have this
trembling in my spirit

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.390
I think I now understand
what it means to be afraid.
