for using Bacon Saver's
special ability, Yuma.

It's too bad
you can't use it again.

victory is mine!

And to prove that point,

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:13.398
I activate Heraldry Crest's

Your tenacity in the face

I believe that
last attack

00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:34.831

a formula for victory.

you don't really
think you can win

because Heraldry Crest ran
out of Overlay Units, do you?

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:45.931
Unfortunately, I have to
burst your bubble.

in my graveyard!

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:54.998
By banishing this monster,

Heraldry Crest regains two
Overlay Units!

facedown and end my turn!

3,800 life points

So hungry.

00:05:50.714 --> 00:05:53.414
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:55.681
It's not me who's
thinkin' of food, Astral.

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:58.381
It's my stomach.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:05:59.881
I know!

00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:02.947

Thanks a lot, Tori!

00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:10.481
I know you have to
stay strong to win.

00:06:11.547 --> 00:06:12.614
All right!

00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:14.214

I remembered Tori

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:15.747

I don't know
about that,

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:26.014

definitely out to lunch.

Oh no.

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:30.747
Guys, if Yuma's hungry,
he's still in this!

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:31.881
That's right!

00:06:31.914 --> 00:06:33.814
Yuma, chow down!

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.314
This is quite...
enjoyable.

00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:46.614
Astral, I never saw you
eat anything before.

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:49.481
This is the first

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:52.247
Well, we can't battle
on two empty stomachs!

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.181
It is strange.

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:59.447
The fighting spirit seems to
be strengthening within me.

00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:00.947
See,
it's good for ya!

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:06.747

At last I'm really

Vetrix, our victory has been
planned from the start.

We'll see.

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.581
Let's go, Yuma.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.547
I'm ready, Astral!

00:10:18.147 --> 00:10:22.081
(Astral and Yuma)
I activate the spell card
Zexal Catapult!

00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:23.614
With this card,
I can summon

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:26.314
one Zexal Weapon from my hand!

00:10:26.347 --> 00:10:29.014

Lightning Blade!

Heraldry Crest steals your
monster's special abilities!

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:51.381
I activate
the special ability

00:10:51.414 --> 00:10:54.214
of Amarylease in my
graveyard!

00:10:54.247 --> 00:10:57.114
By banishing
Amarylease Vetrix...

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.147
I can summon a monster
without tributing

00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:01.381

to blow you away!

00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:03.814

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:10.747
Another pointless
strategy.

00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:13.847
Heraldry Crest,
let's show them why!

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.547
Steal Tornado Bringer's
special ability!

00:11:18.881 --> 00:11:20.814
Now it's absorbed
the special abilities

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.281
of two Zexal Weapons.

00:11:23.314 --> 00:11:24.747

Vetrix is awesome!

00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:25.814
That's it.

He can't
win it now.

It's all over,

I told you not to give him
false hope, Astral...

00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:39.214
didn't I?

00:11:39.247 --> 00:11:41.447
The false hope is yours.

00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:42.547
Huh?!

00:11:42.581 --> 00:11:44.581
You surely know
that Tornado Bringer

00:11:44.614 --> 00:11:47.047
and Lightning Blade
are both Level 5.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.347
Oh no!

00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:50.414
With two overlay
monsters...

00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:52.614
Exactly right, Vetrix.

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:55.614
I can now overlay
Level 5 Lightning Blade

00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:57.181
and Tornado Bringer!

00:11:59.247 --> 00:12:00.447
With these two monsters,

00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:03.314
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.714

Appear, Zexal Weapon Leo Arms!

A Zexal Weapon
Xyz Monster?

(Astral and Yuma)
I equip it on Utopia Ray,

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:27.847
and Utopia Ray gains
3,000 attack points.

00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:37.181
This is the beginning
of your end, Vetrix.

00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:49.914
Impressive monster.

00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:52.314
Too bad your
turn's over, Yuma!

00:12:52.347 --> 00:12:53.347
You're wrong!

00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:55.881
I activate Leo Arms'
special ability!

00:12:57.114 --> 00:12:58.614
And that means...

00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:01.247
my Utopia Ray
can attack again.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.714

turn would be over now!

00:13:04.747 --> 00:13:05.747

00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:07.814

from finished.

Lightning Blade
and Tornado Bringer

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:11.414

00:13:11.447 --> 00:13:13.647
from using its special
abilities,

00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:15.081
