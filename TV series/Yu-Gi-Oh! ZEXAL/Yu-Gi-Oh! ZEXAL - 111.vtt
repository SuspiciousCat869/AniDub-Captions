WEBVTT

00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:04.270
Last time on "Yu-Gi-Oh!
Zexal..."

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.805
(laughing)

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.807
Well, look who it is.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.243
Yuma and Astral.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.344
Number 96!

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.814
You are the one causing havoc in
both our worlds.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.383
Yes, I am.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.619
Look.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.355
And I'm not just destroying
your worlds.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:26.659
My unrelenting power is
devastating Barian World
as well.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.729
I've been looking forward
to our rematch.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.833
Now say goodbye
to your friends!

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.467
Oh, no.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.804
That's a Barian Sphere Field.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.372
Duel!

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.774
Come on out, Chaos Number 39!

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:46.713
Utopia Ray victory!

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:51.384
I send Dark Storm's
Chaos Overlay Unit

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.288
to the graveyard
to take your Number.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.690
(laughing)

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.830
Astral,
we're in trouble big time!

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.432
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:11.337
all your monster, trap and spell
effects are rendered useless

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.805
until the end of the turn.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.608
You have no defenses left.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.144
This is the end!

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.445

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:26.746
Hey, Astral.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.147
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.817
Detention again?

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:31.584
Uh... No!

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.820
My teacher just told me
to stay in school a while

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.822
after everybody else went home.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.092
I believe that
is called detention.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.761
(both laughing)

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.832
(both) Let's duel!

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.333
Ha ha!

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.801
Yuma.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.171
I am truly glad that I met you.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.139
I'm glad I met...

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.808
Hey, how come you're
telling me this now, Astral?

00:02:56.042 --> 00:03:00.713
Yuma, I am entrusting
the Numbers to you.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.815
Astral.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.451
Thank you.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.522
Yuma...

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.757
Yuma...

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:11.824
Yuma!

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.493
Astral!

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.328
What are we doing here?

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.262
Stay focused!

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.297
We are in the middle of a duel!

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:21.067
Ah!
Number 96!

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:21.801
What's wrong?

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.504
Were you daydreaming
again, Yuma?

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.239
Yuma looks out of it.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.807
It must be the power
of the Sphere Field.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.211
All those shocks
are sapping his energy.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.346
Clueless little twerp!

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.149
He doesn't know what he's up
against here.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.817
But it is fun to watch.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:42.822
It's agony for them
in that Barian Sphere Field.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.823
(laughing)

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.293
And I'm sure the worst
is still to come.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:50.830
(Astral)
96's Heart-Earth Chaos Dragon
has left us vulnerable.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:55.368
We must remedy this,
or we will lose the duel.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:04:01.307
It's been fun, but all good
things must come to an end.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.410
Heraldry Crest
of Horror, attack!

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.211
This is bad.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:07.814
With this attack,
it's game over.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:11.317
Yuma, you know what to do!

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:11.751
Yeah!

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:16.789
I can bring out Gagaga Gardna
to join the battle!

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.696
Even though that means I'll lose
my Swords of Burning Light,

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.732
I now have a monster
to defend with.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:27.500
That won't help.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.604
Heraldry Crest of Horror,
attack Gagaga Gardna!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.807
I activate Gagaga Gardna's
special ability!

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.376
By sending Bacon Saver
to the graveyard,

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.612
my Gardna can't be destroyed.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:43.182
Nice try, but you
still take damage.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:45.785
Oh!

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:50.156
Yuma!
Astral!

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:53.826
This duel will be over
before you know it.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:58.297
Dark Storm,
attack Gagaga Gardna!

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:01.801
I activate Dark Storm's
special ability.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.070
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.806
your Gagaga loses
its attack points

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.676
and Dark Storm
gegega-gets them all!

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.550
Yuma, this is the end!

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.821
I activate Bacon Saver's special
ability from the graveyard.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:26.525
By banishing it, I don't take
any damage from your attack.

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.694
So I'm safe.

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:30.763
You don't know when to give up.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.232
Tell the boy he can't win!

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.667
You are wrong.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.203
We cannot lose.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:37.803
Oh, really?

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:43.442
Heart-Earth Chaos Dragon,
attack Gagaga Gardna!

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:49.582
Oh!

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.252
Ah!

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.491
You have 500 life points left.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.827
Neither of you is in
any shape to continue.

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:04.697
Save yourselves some pain.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.832
Just quit.

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:07.833
Never.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.068
No chance!

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:12.805
Have it your way,
but you'll regret it.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:17.510
Heart-Earth Chaos Dragon's
special ability activates.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.514
And the 3500 points of damage
you took this turn

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:25.117
are added to my life points!

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:28.521
Now I have 7500 life points...
jealous?

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.824
That's gonna make him
almost unbeatable.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.697
I'll still take you down!

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:39.832
You know why?

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:43.803
Because it's me and Astral.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:48.741
We have a bond
that nobody can break.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.677
(groaning)

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.246
Yuma!

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.817
Yuma!
Yuma!

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.089
Yuma.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.824
You have exhausted yourself.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:08.260
You must rest for a while.

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:10.730
What're you talking about?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.732
I don't need any rest.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.800
I'm totally...
(groaning)

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.602
(crying)

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.805
Yuma.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.808
Leave the rest to me!

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.815
Number 96, you have caused
enough harm here today.

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:33.419
It is time for your reign to
come to an end.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.557
Prepare for your defeat because
I am feeling the flow!

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:39.525
Astral.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.828
Yuma, please know
that I will always be there

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.498
to high five the sky with you.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:49.602
Now, Number 96, let us duel!

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:57.302
Number 96, let us duel!

00:07:57.302 --> 00:07:57.836
Fine by me.

00:07:57.836 --> 00:08:01.407
The little kid wasn't
much of a challenge anyway.

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:04.443
Hopefully, you won't
disappoint me.

00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:06.845
I activate Number Karma!

00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:09.181
If you don't have a Number
on your field

00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:10.416
at the end of your turn,

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:12.084
you take 500 points of damage.

00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:16.155
And oh, my... that's all your
remaining life points!

00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:16.684
It's over.

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:20.459
Not if Astral summons
a Number on his next turn.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:22.428
It's all up to you now.

00:08:22.428 --> 00:08:24.430
What do the cards
have in store?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.932
I must summon a Number
to avoid defeat.

00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:30.335
Fortunately, Number Return lets
me call back a Number

00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:31.437
from my graveyard.

00:08:31.437 --> 00:08:33.205
Which one shall I choose?

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:34.440
Currently, in our graveyard

00:08:34.673 --> 00:08:39.445
we have Utopia, Heraldry Crest
and Heart-Earth Dragon.

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:43.749
I know in my heart
what I must choose.

00:08:43.749 --> 00:08:45.451
My turn.

00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:46.452
I draw!

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:50.456
It is time to feel the flow.

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:53.459
I activate the trap
Number Return.

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:58.430
It allows me to summon one
Number from my graveyard.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.700
And which Number
will you select?

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.969
Will he pick Heraldry Crest?

00:09:03.969 --> 00:09:06.171
Or go with
Heart-Earth Dragon?

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.441
I choose...

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:11.944
Number 39.

00:09:11.944 --> 00:09:14.913
Utopia!

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.724
(Astral)
Now, my faithful friend,

00:09:25.724 --> 00:09:28.961
I will use the remaining Numbers
in my graveyard

00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:31.296
to increase your Overlay Units.

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:35.200
With two more powerful Numbers
in your graveyard,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.436
you take Utopia?!

00:09:37.436 --> 00:09:38.403
For sure!

00:09:38.403 --> 00:09:42.908
39's always been our lucky
Number, right, Astral?

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:48.147
No matter how bad things get,
Utopia is always there for us.

00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:52.217
That means a lot to me
and to Astral.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.720
We believe in Utopia.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.223
And Utopia believes in us!

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:58.654
Really?

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.294
Well, I believe that putting
your faith in friendship

00:10:02.294 --> 00:10:06.431
leads to jealousy,
suspicion and betrayal.

00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:07.432
If you're smart,

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:10.102
you'll all forget that
sentimental mumbo-jumbo,

00:10:10.102 --> 00:10:12.137
so you'll never
be let down again.

00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:13.005
Just look at me.

00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:15.707
I never depend on anyone
but myself.

00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.443
My power is all
that I ever will need!

00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:22.447
Having friends and working
together's not mumbo jumbo!

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:24.983
Being part of a team,
part of something bigger

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:27.319
and more important
than just yourself,

00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:29.454
that makes everybody better.

00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:31.824
It makes everybody stronger.

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.194
It makes life mean something!

00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:37.129
Yuma.

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:39.731
It is time for team work.

00:10:39.731 --> 00:10:41.133
You got it.

00:10:42.034 --> 00:10:45.103
Are you ready?

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.307
Let's do it.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:56.982
It's time
to high five...
The sky!

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:05.858
(Yuma)
All right, it's time for you and
I to build the Overlay Network!

00:11:05.858 --> 00:11:08.827
(Astral)
When two distant souls
become one,

00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:12.097
the power of Zexal is revealed.

00:11:12.097 --> 00:11:15.033
(both) Go Zexal Morph!

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:18.437
Number 96, you're through!

00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:24.841
♪ ♪

00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:28.045
Too little, too late.

00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:29.413
You can't stop me now!

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:34.418
The bond Astral and I have has
the power to overcome anything.

00:11:34.418 --> 00:11:36.620
Let's go, Utopia!

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.991
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:52.469
I summon Chaos Number 39,
Utopia Ray!

00:11:56.406 --> 00:11:59.342
(laughing)

00:11:59.342 --> 00:12:01.945
I activate Number Lockdown!

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:03.613
You can change your appearance,

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:07.984
but you can't change the fact
that you're a horrible duelist.

00:12:08.151 --> 00:12:13.990
Now Utopia Ray can't attack or
use its special abilities.

00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:18.895
And it's destroyed
at the end of the turn!

00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:19.463
One more thing...

00:12:19.463 --> 00:12:23.333
You'll take damage equal
to your monster's attack points!

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.869
That's more than enough
to finish him off.

00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:27.604
He better think fast!

00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:30.607
So what are you gonna do?

00:12:30.607 --> 00:12:32.609
Yuma.
Okay.

00:12:32.609 --> 00:12:33.510
Get ready.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.313
I activate Xyz Treasure!

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:41.551
I draw one card from my deck for
every Xyz Monster on the field.

00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:44.521
That means I get
to draw four cards.

00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:47.624
So my hand's about to get
a lot more crowded.

00:12:47.624 --> 00:12:51.461
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:55.332
He can even generate the very
cards that he needs.

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.968
Go Shining Draw!

00:12:58.235 --> 00:13:01.605
These four cards will be
the end of you, Number 96.

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:06.510
And I start it off with the
spell card Utopian Hope!

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.614
It breaks Utopia Ray
loose from its chains.

00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:14.417
(groaning)

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.619
And since it's now free,

00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:18.388
Utopia Ray regains
its special abilities.

00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:22.526
By using an Overlay Unit,
it gains 500 attack points.

00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:26.863
And it's triple the trouble
for you when I use all three.

00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:30.333
Go Overlay Charge!

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:30.901
Even better,

00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:34.471
one of your monsters also
loses 1000 attack points

00:13:34.471 --> 00:13:36.273
for every Overlay Unit.

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:39.943
I select Heraldry
Crest of Horror.

00:13:39.943 --> 00:13:44.614
Now I summon Zexal Weapon
Sleipnir Mail.

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:47.150
(galloping)

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.085
(neighing)

00:13:49.085 --> 00:13:52.522
I equip it on to Utopia Ray.

00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:56.393
Utopia Ray gets a power boost

00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:58.962
equal to
Sleipnir's attack points.

00:13:58.962 --> 00:14:03.600
And next, I activate
the spell Overtake Summon.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.434
You're gonna help me out,

00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:07.270
because I get to use
<i>your</i> monster's Overlay Unit

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.607
to summon a monster forme!

00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:19.916
I summon Zexal Weapon
Asura Strike.

00:14:22.052 --> 00:14:24.621
I equip it onto Utopia Ray

00:14:24.621 --> 00:14:26.189
to further boost
its attack points.

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:28.358
And it gives Utopia Ray
more punch,

00:14:28.358 --> 00:14:29.826
because it lets Utopia Ray

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:33.597
attack all three
of your monsters.

00:14:41.304 --> 00:14:44.241
It attacks all three
of my monsters?

00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:47.577
Number 96 may have
a ton of life points...

00:14:47.577 --> 00:14:50.614
but this will crush him.

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:52.182
Go, Utopia Ray!

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:56.419
Attack Heart-Earth
Chaos Dragon first.

00:14:56.419 --> 00:14:57.420
Aagh!

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.321
Not so fast!

00:14:58.321 --> 00:15:00.423
I activate the trap
Chaos Alliance!

00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:04.361
Now all my Chaos Numbers have
the same number of attack points

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:08.531
as the strongest monster
on my field, Dark Storm.

00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:12.202
They all power up
to 2500 attack points!

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:17.340
Go, Rising Sun Asura Divider!

00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:27.384
Aagh!

00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:28.885
Keep going.

00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:32.889
Take down Heraldry
Crest of Horror next.

00:15:42.599 --> 00:15:47.604
If I destroy Dark Storm,
we'll win the duel.

00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:49.606
I do not think so.

00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:50.607
Have you forgotten?

00:15:50.607 --> 00:15:52.242
If you destroy Dark Storm,

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:55.345
I'm not the only who takes
damage... we both do!

00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.447
We'll go down
in defeat together.

00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:00.550
That's so not gonna happen.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.352
Go, Utopia Ray!

00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:05.088
Attack Dark Storm.

00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:05.955
(neighing)

00:16:05.955 --> 00:16:07.624
Sleipnir Mail's
special ability activates

00:16:07.624 --> 00:16:10.260
so Utopia Ray's
attack points become the same

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.196
as your Dark Storm.

00:16:13.196 --> 00:16:13.930
Say what?

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.333
They'll both be destroyed!

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:20.303
Rising Sun Asura Divider!

00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:23.873
This changes nothing!

00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:25.942
We'll both still go down
in defeat together

00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:29.446
because Number Karma will
deal us 500 points of damage

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:30.880
at the end of the turn.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.585
I'll admit, it was a clever
attempt at success, Yuma.

00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:37.420
But you've failed!

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.623
That's what you think,
Number 96.

00:16:40.623 --> 00:16:41.124
Oh!

00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:44.527
I activate Sleipnir Mail's
special ability!

00:16:44.527 --> 00:16:46.596
When Utopia Ray is destroyed,

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.501
we can summon Utopia
from the graveyard.

00:16:55.905 --> 00:16:57.607
This can't be!

00:16:57.607 --> 00:17:01.611
Trust me, Number 96, it is.

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:04.614
Go!

00:17:04.614 --> 00:17:07.617
Utopia, finish him off!

00:17:29.172 --> 00:17:30.240
They did it!

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.007
They won!

00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:33.610
Yeah, way to go, you two!

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.613
I knew we could do it, Astral.

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:39.048
(Astral) So did I.

00:17:39.048 --> 00:17:40.617
(breathing heavily)

00:17:40.617 --> 00:17:44.988
(Yuma)
I guess we're
a pretty good team.

00:17:46.089 --> 00:17:47.624
I lost the duel.

00:17:47.624 --> 00:17:50.593
I cannot believe it.

00:17:50.593 --> 00:17:54.097
It's all over.

00:17:54.097 --> 00:17:56.599
For you, that is!

00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:58.601
(Astral) Can you stand, Yuma?

00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:02.138
Yeah, I'm okay...
Astral!

00:18:04.607 --> 00:18:07.944
You can't get rid
of me that easily.

00:18:07.944 --> 00:18:09.345
You may have won the duel,

00:18:09.345 --> 00:18:15.084
but I still have enough power
to finish you once and for all!

00:18:15.618 --> 00:18:17.120
Yuma!

00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:22.853
Yuma!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:27.824
Astral!

00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:32.562
(Number 96)
Yuma, your friend
can't help you anymore.

00:18:32.562 --> 00:18:37.267
In fact, he can't even
help himself now!

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.738
Astral!

00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:43.540
I will destroy everything.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.843
You, your friends, everything!

00:18:46.843 --> 00:18:50.280
(Astral)
I will not
let this happen.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.283
Yuma...

00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:55.819
it will be okay.

00:18:55.819 --> 00:18:59.723
(Astral groaning)

00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:07.998
(explosions)

00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:22.012
Astral!

00:19:22.012 --> 00:19:23.847
Astral?

00:19:23.847 --> 00:19:26.850
Yuma, I am glad you are safe.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.019
You totally got rid
of Number 96!

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:31.021
But we were supposed
to beat him together.

00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:34.491
I could not take the chance
and risk your safety.

00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:35.258
What?

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:36.259
We're a team.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.962
Yes, we are...
and friends.

00:19:38.962 --> 00:19:41.998
And I will always
treasure our friendship.

00:19:41.998 --> 00:19:46.670
You have shown me again and
again its real meaning

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.107
and how precious
a bond it truly is.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:54.211
Now I must go, my friend.

00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:55.679
Huh?

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:59.282
Take care of the Numbers.

00:19:59.516 --> 00:20:01.017
No.

00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:02.285
No!

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:03.987
Astral, you can't go.
