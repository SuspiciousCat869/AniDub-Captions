All security systems disabled.

Litterbot a: Commence operation
clean house.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.990

Let's roll!

Lillybot: You forgot me.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.690
You forgot me.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.960
Hello.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.190
Hello.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.990
Do not leave me behind!

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.260
Uh oh!

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.190
Whoa!

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.460

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Now accepting

the world duel carnival!

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.060
Do you have what it takes?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.660
Yuma: How come I only feel the
flow during duels and never on

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.490
days when there's a pop quiz?

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.490
Tori: Maybe cuz you duel more
than you study!

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.360
Oh Yeah, well, not if you
count studying dueling!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.760
What's wrong little guy?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.960
He must've got separated
from his mom.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.860
A litterbot?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.060
Why's he lying down on the job?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.090
Hey

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.660
are you okay?

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.290
It's like they're trying
to tell us something.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.030
Whoa!

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.060
What's that!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.730
Open it and see!

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330
Bronk: That solves the mystery
of where mom is.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.090
How cute

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.730
but still

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.260
it doesn't solve the
mystery of why this

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.830
litterbot's here.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.530
Yeah, ya gotta point there

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.690
let's see here, I think
this should do it.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.790
Do what?

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.890
I dunno.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.160
Something I hope

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.890
you sure you know what
you're doing here?

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.090
Of course I don't.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.760
Astral: Yuma

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.560
try connecting that red cord.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.430
I guess it couldn't hurt

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.690
here

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.790
use this.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.460
My hair clip.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.060
Thanks Tori

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.260
let - Go - Please!

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.330
Trash identified,
trash identified

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.790
yeah

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.690
I'd say it's working just fine
now, wouldn't ya agree, yuma!

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.230
I'll agree to anything just get
this thing to let me go!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.830
Shh, do you guys hear that?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.730
He attacks me then
follows me home?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.190
Aw, man!

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.530
Aw, man.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.560
I think he likes you, yuma, why
don't ya look after him?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.730
Cuz I've got better things to do
than Babysit some bot!

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.790
Like duel!

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.960
Duel.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.930
Duel, duel, duel,
duel, duel, duel, duel

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.290
what now?!

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.360
what's a litterbot doing
with a duel disk?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.390
Eh

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.090
what's it matter,
he's got no deck

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.530
deck!

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.990
Duel!

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.690
Next I activate the spell card
star light, star bright.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.890
With this card, when there are
monsters on the field with

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.060
either the same attack points or
the same defense points, I can

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.490
take one of their

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.490
levels and change all the other
monsters to that same level!

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.930
As a result, I will change
junk robot teapot

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.830
Kangaroo's level to that of junk
robot camelcycle, which is 4!

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.730
Next I overlay level 4 teapot
kangaroo and camelcycle,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.960
and with the overlay
network now created,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.690
I will xyz summon!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.530
Wind-Up zenmaister!

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.130
Zenmaister, attack
yuma directly!

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.590
Alright, litterbot!

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.260
Yuma stinks, yuma stinks.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.330
Say what?!

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.560
relax

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.330
this litterbot is not trying to
insult you, he is

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.090
simply stating a fact.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.630
Way to duel, litterbot!

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.190
Huh?

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.860
Pretty, pretty!

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.960
Red Ribbon Makes
litterbot look pretty!

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.160
Aw

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.660
I think he's not a he, Tori.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.690
Oh, so yuma didn't get beat by a
guy, he got beat by a girl!

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.860
Yeah

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.890
Thanks for clearing that up.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.930
Girl.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.060
Ya know what, I have an idea

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.960
I think we should give our new
litterbot friend a proper name!

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.360
Let's see here, what
should we call her?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.830
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.560
How 'bout 'annoying ?'

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.890
be nice!

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.590
It's better than something
lame like lillybot.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.630
Lillybot, lillybot!

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.860
Lillybot, lillybot!

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.190
Lillybot, lillybot!

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.330
Well done!

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.930
I think you just
named her, yuma!

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.360
I love yuma, yuma, yuma.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.490
Aw man

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.490
first ASTRAL gloms
onto me and now this

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.390
yuma is lillybot's
best friend forever!

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.460
Bff!

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.790
Friends for life!

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.160
Here, Lilly, catch!

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.660
Catch.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.930
Nothing but net.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.490
Wrong basket!

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.130
Way to roll, Lilly!

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.030
I can't believe it's been
such a great day.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.830
G'night, lillybot.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.690
Everything is set

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.090
time for my litterbots to
clean House once again.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.360
Lillybot!

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.590
Wonder where she rolled off to?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.530
Why'd she leave this here?

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.890
Lilly's idea of a note?

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.390
Kari: Unbelievable!

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.290
This is gonna be the scoop that
makes my career, I just know it!

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.960
Hold it there, bro.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.160
I need your help.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.190
Look here

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.560
I don't care about your scoop

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.490
do you care about
millions of dollars?

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.960
Cuz that's what this is about!

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.860
Someone's been ripping
off jewelry stores.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.790
I got some security
footage from a source

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.860
but it's so blurry.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.730
Can you make anything out of it?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.630
No way

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.930
is that, lillybot?

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.530
I'm telling you, whoever's
behind This is good.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.560
There's not a duel security
system out there that this

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.530
mystery person can't take down.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.730
That is because it
is not a person.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.360
Perhaps This is why lillybot is
so good at dueling

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.860
she was programmed to be.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.430
The question is,
programmed by whom?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.560
And I think that is a question
we might be able to

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.990
answer using Simple logic.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.130
Since the thief seems to
disappear after each

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.260
heist that means

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.730
that means what?

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.990
That means he needs someplace to
disappear to, some place close

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.460
close to all of the jewelry
stores he has robbed so far.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.630
Like this little
hideaway right here

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.390
so let's roll!

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.990
Hey!

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.890
Thanks a lot for the help!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.530
Tonight's been the
best haul yet!

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.230
But since no one's smart enough
to figure out my scheme, I'm

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.830
sure it'll only get better

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.660
hold it right there!

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.430
Hey, who are you?

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.630
Me?

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.690
I'm lillybot's bff,
that's who I am!

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.690
Who's lillybot?

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.090
You talkin' 'bout her?

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.430
Sorry But these bots
are mine, so get lost!

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.590
No way!

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.460
Litterbot's aren't
something you own!

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.560
So

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.230
let her go right now!

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.230
Okay

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.460
get him.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.930
Hey lillybot!

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.960
Don't you remember me,
it's me yuma!

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.990
Lillybot?

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.430
Lillybot!

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.830
What's with you?!

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.090
no kidding!

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.360
So much for the whole best
friends forever thing.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.330
What now?

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.430
Now we duel!

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.090
Let's go!

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.390
Duel accepted.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.790
Target confirmed.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.560
Prepare to be eradicated.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.430
And why exactly did you
challenge Lilly to a duel?

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.960
This is why.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.430
She left this card behind.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.660
And with it

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.330
I'll bring her back

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.590
or, if that doesn't
work, go down trying!

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.060
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.690
Let's duel!

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.590
Game time!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.760
Hope you're ready, Lilly!

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760
Cuz I'm drawin'!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.990
first I summon gagaga magician!

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.290
Next I'll place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.290
Initiating protocol 3z.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.890
Draw!

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.060
First I activate
eco spell - Reduce waste!

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.230
With this card, by banishing two
junk robot monsters in my deck,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.360
I can add junk robot
camelcycle to my hand.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.390
I now summon camelcycle!

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.490
I then activate
eco spell - Recycle!

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.160
With this card, I can summon the
two junk robot monsters That

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.990
were banished earlier!

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.990
I now summon Junk robot cleanaga

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.930
and junk robot computerkong!

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.330
It's goin' ape!

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.590
I now overlay these three
level 4 junk robots.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.460
And by way of this overlay, an
overlay network has been created

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.060
and with it I will
now xyz Summon

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.990
recycle rhinobot!

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.890
Initiating Protocol

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.590
33F: Rhinobot attacks
gagaga magician!

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.630
Yuma!

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.030
I know!

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.190
I play the trap

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.930
half unbreak!

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.690
Now my monster is spared, and I
only take half the damage!

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.830
Keep Fighting, yuma!

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.090
You're Lilly's one
and only chance!

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.290
Yeah

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.330
I wish someone
would tell her that!

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.460
Here goes

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.630
draw!

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.790
And now

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.590
I'll play my draw!

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.260
Rise up, gagaga girl!

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.490
Next up is wonder wand

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.330
So gagaga girl gains 500 extra
attack points!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.660
Nice move

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.830
and now it is time for you take
it to the next level!

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.330
No doubt!

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.660
Now I play my
magician's ability!

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.890
Its Level changes from 4 to 8
until the end of my turn!

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.930
Really, yuma?

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.960
But

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.260
then I activate the spell card

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.960
gagaga thunder!

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.490
But don't look to the sky when
ya hear the boom, look to your

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.390
life points, cuz you take damage
equal to the difference between

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.730
my monster's levels

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.360
times 300!

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.160
And in case your software isn't
up to date, I'll do

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.990
the math for ya - The difference

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.260
is five!

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.430
So you take 1500
points of damage!

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.260
I then place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.390
Now that my turn's over, gagaga
magician's level

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.830
changes back from 8 to 4.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.830
Yuma

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.260
I tried to tell you

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.230
gagaga girl has an ability that
would have changed Lilly's xyz

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.390
monster's attack points to zero.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.230
If you changed your magician's
level to gagaga girl's and xyz

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.360
summoned leviathon Dragon, you
could have attacked

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.990
rhinobot and you would have won.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.030
Not until I
play Lilly's card!

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.160
Your turn, Lilly!

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.530
Initiating Protocol 2x.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.230
Draw!

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.190
First I summon junk robot
teapot kangaroo!

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.660
I now activate
rhinobot's ability!

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.830
For every overlay unit I use, a
different monster on my field

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.490
other than rhinobot gains 500
additional attack points.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.190
Not good.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:29.860
I use three overlay units, so
teapot Kangaroo now gains 1500

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860
attack points!

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.260
That is one mean marsupial!

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.990
First, I will have rhinobot
attack gagaga girl!

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.460
I activate the trap
card gagagaguard!

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.490
Now since there are two gagaga
monsters on the field, gagaga

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.960
girl can't be destroyed
this battle!

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.730
Protocol 41a - Teapot kangaroo
ATTACKS gagaga magician!

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.890
No good, Lilly

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.790
gagagaguard protects him too!

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.790
Perhaps.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.890
But not you!

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.190
Oh no!

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.590
Yuma

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.890
your life points Cannot TAKE too
much more of this.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.260
I know it

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.360
but I have to hold on 'til
I can play Lilly' !

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.360
It's our only chance, astral

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.530
ya see

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.330
if Lilly sees that old card.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.030
Maybe she'll go back
to her old self too!

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.690
Old, self

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.290
that's right, Lilly!

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.330
Just think back!

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.290
I, I, I activate
rhinobot's ability!

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.160
When rhinobot does not have any
overlay units, my monster with

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.460
the least amount of attack
points is destroyed.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.590
As a result, we both take damage
equal to the destroyed monster's

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.090
original attack points.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.430
Yuma

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.890
when that special ability
Activates again next turn

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.730
both you and Lilly will
run out of life points!

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.160
Well in that case

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.590
I'd better hope for
the perfect draw

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.030
well done, litterbot.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.160
Now to make sure those meddling
kids meddle no more!

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.260
What was that?

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.030
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.860
Countdown set at one minute.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.730
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.390
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.730
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.560
Countdown set at one minute.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.260
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.660
Self-Destruct program initiated.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.890
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.390
Lillybot's gonna explode?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.160
That is correct yuma.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.760
You need to stop that countdown
before it reaches zero!

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.330
But how?!

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.730
how else

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.060
just stick with your plan and
duel Lilly's memory back!

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.690
then it all comes down to this

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.560
time to feel the flow!

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.360
Draw!

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.090
It's here!

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.230
I activate the spell card star
light, star bright from my hand!

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.660
What is this?

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.430
It's a spell card that lets me
match gagaga girl's level to

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.830
gagaga magician!

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.930
Memory Banks overriding
operational protocol.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.490
Override, override, override

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:34.030
yuma stinks, yuma stinks,
yuma stinks, yuma stinks

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.290
look, its working!

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.660
She's coming back!

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.760
She really is!

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.130
Don't stop!

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.430
Keep on yelling that yuma
stinks, lillybot, just like you

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.460
did in the good
old days, remember?

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.330
Yuma stinks, yuma stinks,
yuma stinks YUMA stinks

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.590
Operational protocol has been
successfully overridden

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.490
she's, back!

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.290
Therefore failsafe systems
are now enacted.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.830
No she's not!

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.390
There are just twenty
seconds remaining, yuma.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.590
Yeah?!

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.830
then I better put
them to good use!

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.830
I now overlay level 4 gagaga
magician and gagaga girl!

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.230
With These two monsters, I build
the overlay network and Xyz

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.990
summon NUMBER 39: Utopia!

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.090
The time!

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.830
explosion, a man was arrested
after a trove of

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.930
stolen jewels was found.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.130

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.260
