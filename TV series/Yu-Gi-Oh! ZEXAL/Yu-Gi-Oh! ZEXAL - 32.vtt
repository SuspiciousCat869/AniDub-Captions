WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.890
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.660
KARI: So he snagged everyone's
cards and then took off?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.530
I don't believe that guy!

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.290
YUMA: So do you think that crazy
card he dueled with is what he

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.860
stole from the museum?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.290
Sounds like it.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.590
Everyone who's ever had that
card has been blessed with a

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.890
sudden streak of crazy luck.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560
Who is this guy, sis?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.590
Charlie Mccay was
dad's assistant.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.660
Kari, I've got him!

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330
We're on the d line monorail!

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.030
I'm on my way!

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.390
You took my card,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.060
I'd like to have it back.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.560
Charlie: Heh, heh, heh.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.060
Well as it happens, I've jammed
this monorail so it can't be

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.590
stopped by the control center.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.360
And I'm afraid our destination
is all the way on the other side

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.160
of the city. So uh, what do
you say we pass the time with a

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.360
little duel?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.060
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.260
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.130
Tori: Be careful, yuma!

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.190

NURSE: May, it's almost
time for your surgery.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.330
Don't worry.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.190
You're just gonna take a nap and
when you wake up, it'll be done.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.630
May: But, uh...

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.630
my Uncle Should be here.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.490
Yuma...

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.260
Please be careful!

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.730
Alright, yuma.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.830
It's time to let
the games begin.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.460
First move's mine!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.560
Here goes - I draw!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.430
I place a monster facedown
in defense mode!

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.590
Then I end my turn
with a facedown card!

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.290
ASTRAL: Is Charlie going
to once again rely on luck?

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.690
My turn, I draw.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.290
I activate the take
a chance spell card!

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.790
Pass me the dice.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.290
E take a chance allows me to
roll a die once per turn and if

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.060
it comes up a six?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.090
My current life points
are multiplied by five!

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.530
Any other number, and my life
points return to where they were

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.190
before I activated the spell.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.690
Heh,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.030
well, it's not like it's easy
to roll a six or anything.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.290
And do not forget that he rolled
a six five times in a row during

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.090
his last duel.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.760
The odds of rolling six sixes
in a row are 46,656 to one.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.360
Watch closely.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.860
No way you'll get it!

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.930
Another six!

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.490
How is that possible?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.590
Suddenly I've got
20,000 life points!

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.630
As long as the sun that
shines, stays complete,

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.630
I never have to fear defeat.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.660
Do what?

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.260
The sun already went
down, hours ago!

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.290
And yet my incredible
lucky streak continues.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.260
I now summon majestic Jester.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.460
Majestic Jester, take out
his facedown monster!

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.390
But Majestic Jester doesn't
have any attack points!

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.190
Go Dark pantomime!

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.860
Gogogo Golem's got
1500 defense points!

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.130
So you're the one
who's taking damage!

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.930
Not necessarily. Majestic
Jester's ability activates.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.860
You gotta be kidding!

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.430
Luck's gonna decide
if I take damage or not.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.760
If I roll a six while majestic
Jester is attacking, your

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.890
monster is instantly destroyed.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.930
Any other number comes up,
and this clown is goin' down.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.660
The odds of this happening
are 279,936 to one.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660
Enough with the statistics!

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.460
Let's roll.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.960
Implausible.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.260
Aw, come on!

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.630
Alright!

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.090
Gogogo Golem is done for!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.590
I toss one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.730
Yuma, hurry!

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.460
This train is out of control!

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.930
Don't worry about that,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.490
worry about the fact that you
have no chance of winning.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.290
charlie, you vanished without a
word, and now you pop back into

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.290
my Life, acting like you did
nothing wrong, expecting things

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.890
to be the same.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.330
well, they're not!

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.660
My turn!

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.960
I draw!

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.460
I summon gagaga magician!

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.090
This is the part where
I try my luck!

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.460
I activate the monster
slots spell card!

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.990
With this card,
I banish a monster in my

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.660
graveyard that's the same
level as gagaga magician!

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.590
And then I can draw a
new card from my deck.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.560
If it's a monster that has the
same level as the other two

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.960
monsters, I can
summon it to my field!

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.760
But if it is not yuma, then the
card you draw and your level 4

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.590
gagaga magician
will be banished.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.890
This is foolish.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.960
Nnnnn, who asked you?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.130
If this works, I'll have
an xyz monster out in no time!

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.690
But it's not gonna work. Fortune
is favoring me right now, which

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.630
means you're outta luck.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.130
We'll see about that!

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.390
Okay here we go, I draw!

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.060
Aaagh!

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.860
Seriously?

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.690
So much for those cards.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.090
Sorry, yuma!

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.560
I'm afraid lady
luck is on my side!

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.990
Well... I end my turn.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.760
It occurs to me, the odds
of us defeating him might be

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.660
50,000,000 to one.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.030
Come on!

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.830
Have a little faith, astral!

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.490
Don't you get it, yuma?

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.090
If luck isn't on your side,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.060
everything else
goes out the window.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.490
I always admired your old man.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.860
I thought he had everything.
Courage, intelligence, charisma,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.590
passion...

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.460
but you know what
he didn't have?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.730
He didn't have luck
on his side.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.290
And?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.760
If he just had a little
bit of luck, then he...

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.030
what are you talking about?

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.930
Sometimes you come to a point

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.590
where it all comes down
to one thing. Good luck.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.130
And if luck isn't on your side,
then there's nothing you can do.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.960
And now, it's my
turn... I draw!

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.260
Time to play take
a chance again!

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.330
If I roll a six, my life points
get multiplied by five!

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.360
Come on, two!

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.290
Six again?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.660
How is that possible?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.490
Fortune favors the bold.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.790
Now I'm sittin' on a hundred
thousand life points!

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.490
This is crazy!

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.730
There's nothing I can
do to defeat this guy?

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.030
And now, by activating
the release change spell,

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.230
I can toss a
monster off my field.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.360
Then summon a monster with the
same level to take its place.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.690
Say goodbye to majestic Jester,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.360
and then say
hello to dice leveler!

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.230
Next, I activate the
monster slots spell card.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.460
Hey, that's the same
card I just played!

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.830
That's right.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.760
But somehow I think things are
gonna end differently for me.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.760
First, I select level
1 dice leveler!

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.630
And then I banish level 1

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.860
majestic Jester
from my graveyard!

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.090
Now, if the card I draw is a

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.390
level 1 Monster, then I can
place that monster on my field.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.030
Yes!

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.390
There we go!

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.030
It's dice leveler!

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.860
Two of em?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.190
Actually, I'm gonna make this
a perfect triple jackpot.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.530
I summon a third dice leveler!

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.890
This is bad, yuma.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.660
And now I roll the dice
and dice leveler's level

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.930
increases by the number I roll.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.530
Come on,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.090
all sixes!

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.160
The odds of him rolling
three more sixes...

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
are 362 million, 700...

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.260
I don't wanna
hear it anymore!

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.790
What have we got?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.060
Yeah!

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.760
Come on!

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.790
This isn't happening,
I don't believe it.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.290
Believe it!

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.460
All three of my monsters
become level 7's!

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.930
And now I'm just gonna
overlay my dice levelers

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.160
and build myself a
little overlay network!

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.890
I xyz summon
number 7, lucky straight!

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.930
There it is!

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.430
The number card...

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.860
what can I say, yuma?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.630
Life is a carnival!

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.490
Now what?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.860
What do you mean,
'now what?' now yo se.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.830
As long as the sun
stays complete?

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.990
I never have to fear defeat.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.300
Huh?

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.890
tori!

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.160
kari?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.730
Stay calm and listen.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.760
That monorail you guys are on is
gonna reach the final station in

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.130
about five minutes.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.930
What? That doesn't
leave much time.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.190
don't worry.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.260
I'll think of something.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.460
Just hang tight.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.960
Yuma!

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.790
The end of the
line is coming up!

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.990
What?

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.290
Don't worry,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.560
my good luck will make sure
we stop safe and sound.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.390
I'd be more worried by the fact
that I can cash in an overlay

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.690
unit and multiply lucky
straight's attack points By

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.830
whatever number I roll.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.830
Come on, be good to me.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.560
Alright.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.690
Normally, lucky straight's
got 700 attack points,

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.860
but when multiplied by six,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.060
we're
talkin' 4200!

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.790
How can I stop that?

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.430
Lucky Straight, attack
yuma directly!

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.860
Go Hand slam!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.190
Yuma, your trap!

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.690
I'm on it!

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.830
I activate the
nitwit outwit trap card!

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.960
This trap allows me to send one
monster card in my hand to the

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.890
graveyard in order to lower the
damage I take by that monster's

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.490
attack points.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.130
You're up, zubaba Knight!

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.690
Time to take one for the team!

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.190
Yuma!

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.960
A well-Timed
trap card. Not bad.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.760
You bought yourself
another turn.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.790
This isn't good. You got any
suggestions for me, astral?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.760
If his luck is Perfect, then...

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.490
there is nothing you can do.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.690
Well, but...

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.060
hey!

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.590
you Guys need to
wrap this up soon!

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.330
kari!

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.660
Kari!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.760
don't try to run off and
hide again, Charlie!

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.090
you and I are
gonna have a little talk.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.790
And what are we
gonna talk about?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.560
How you miss me and think
about me all the time?

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.230
yuma...

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.530
you're losing against the lucky
straight card he took from the

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.330
museum, aren't you?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.860
Uh, maybe.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.290
there's a saying that
goes with that card.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.890
"As long as the sun that shines

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.260
stays complete, I never
have to fear defeat."

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.790
Okay, what does that mean?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.830
I searched the datanet but
I couldn't find any answers.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.460
But you know everything.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.790
It's just a little saying,
you know, for good luck.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.060
"As long as the sun
that shines stays complete,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.490
I never got to fear defeat!"

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.460
"The sun that shines..."

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.430
it doesn't mean anything,
it's just a figure of speech.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.490
Running out of time here.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.590
You can go ahead and
give up now if you want.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.590
Don't think anyone
would blame you.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.890
That's nice of you
to say. Thing is,

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.930
there's no way I'm giving up!

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.260
It's my turn!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.690
I draw!

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.860
I'm summoning ganbara Knight!

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.130
And when I successfully bring a
level 4 monster to the field,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.560
I can then summon
kagetokage from my hand!

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.190
And now, I'm gonna overlay
ganbara Knight and kagetokage!

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.560
With These two monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.730
I xyz summon
number 39: Utopia!

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.990
And now utopia,
attack lucky straight!

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.930
I activate a trap.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.690
Dice crisis!

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.490
If I roll a six, one of your
monsters loses all its attack

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.160
points and I take
control of it.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.790
Let's see a three...

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.990
anything but six.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.490
Would Ya' look at that.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.630
Another six!

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.530
Utopia is mine.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.930
This is bad. I place
one card facedown,

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.830
and end my turn.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.730
Last stop coming up.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.890
Let's end this duel.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.430
You can't win, yuma.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.760
Sometimes you just have
to know when to walk away.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.390
That's not gonna happen!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.830
E here's the thing CHARLIE:
I'd rather lose relying on my

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.260
skills as a duelist
than win relying on luck.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.630
You remember my dad, don't ya?

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.430
That's right.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.660
Then you know he taught me to
believe in myself and to never

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.290
back down and never
walk away. So I won't!

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.830
I won't give up!

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.430
Yuma...

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.230
win or lose, I'll see
this through to the end!

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.760
And the end is gonna
be me winnin'!

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.360
I get it.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.330
You got spirit, I'll give you
that. But it's my turn now!

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.590
Yuma!

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.860
On it!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.190
Not so fast,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.360
first I activate a trap!

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.860
Commander of swords!

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.130
I can use this when there's a
light attribute warrior-Type

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.660
monster on the field.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.090
And it doesn't matter if
it's on my side or yours.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.990
Now draw your card!

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.990
If it's a spell or a trap card,
then I get to destroy it

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.130
or a spell or trap card
on your field instead.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.530
I see.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.160
You're hoping to get
rid of dice crisis.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.890
You want utopia back.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.090
Draw the card, Charlie.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.160
I drew a little beauty
known as sun scale.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.990
With this card in play, once a
turn, if I roll a six, I can

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.390
obliterate every
monster on your field.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.190
And I mean let's face it
yuma, with the way things have

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.160
been going, we both know
that I'm gonna roll a six.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.790
The sun.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.660
I'm destroying dice
crisis, and...

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.160
Wait, do not do that!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.430
Why not?

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.860
Sever the sun.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.590
The sun?

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.530
No way.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.830
Oh, right!

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.390
It's a sun!

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.060
That's just an expression,
though. It won't do anything.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.860
You sound like you're not
too sure about that.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.260
Let's find out what happens.
With the power of the commander

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.830
of swords trap,
I'm destroying sun scale.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.390
There's no way...

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.160
go, utopia!

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.860
Rising Sun slash!

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.590
He did it. Yuma managed
to cut the sun in half.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.090
Wait, no!

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.860
Don't leave me now!

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.690
What's that light?

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.260
Did that just break
my lucky streak?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.030
You're finished, yuma!

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.760
Since Sun scale was destroyed,
you take 500 points of damage.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.130
And now to follow that up, I'm
using take a chance's effect.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.860
You know what happens if I roll
a six. My life points are once

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.330
again multiplied by five!

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.630
One?

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.690
Noooo!

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.190
Unbelievable. I guess my luck
seems to have run out.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.730
I end my turn.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.130
Now, this is it, yuma!

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.790
Yeah, let's do this thing!

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.160
I draw!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.890
Heh!

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.590
I activate the come
back spell card!

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.190
This allows me to get my
monster back from your field!

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.560
Alright, utopia,
time to come home!

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.890
I'm feelin' the flow!

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.690
Go Chaos xyz evolution!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.130
Get ready for chaos number 39!

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.730
Utopia ray!

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.060
Oh man,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.430
just my luck.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.830
Utopia ray's
ability activates!

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.190
For every overlay unit it uses,
it gains 500 attack points!

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.930
Go Overlay charge!

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.690
But that's not all,
also for every overlay unit,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.460
your monster loses
1000 attack points.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.530
Now do it, utopia ray!

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.530
Attack Lucky straight!

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.130
Rising Sun chaos slash!

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.790
All right!

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.860
I won!

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.030
Yuma!

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.730
The station!

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.090
We're not gonna stop in time!

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.290
Kari!

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.490
What are you doing?

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.730
It's too dangerous!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:05.130
I told you I'd
think of something.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.000
Kari, get out of the way!

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.960
Kari, get out of the way!

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.490
Kari...

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.630
you guys okay?

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.690
We're good.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.960
Thanks.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.490
That was close. Wait,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.530
what about Charlie?

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.330
I jinxed it...

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.830
I am so sorry, may.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.660
Our luck... it's gone.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.690
What are you talking about?

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.130
Kari.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.690
Who's this may girl, Charlie?

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.530
May!

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.290
Uncle Charlie!

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.260
I'm really sorry that
I'm late, kiddo.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.660
It's okay.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.260
You're gonna do great in there.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.990
You got nothin' to worry about.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.430
Yeah I know.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.460
You are brave.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.960
Thanks.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.190
Oh, and one more thing.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.490
Take this card for good luck.
Not that you need it.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.560
Thank you...

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.060
you're the best, uncle Charlie.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.930
See that?

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.930
Maybe the good luck came
back to the card

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.230
now that it changed hands.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.760
May's operation was a risky one,
but they told us it had to be

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.830
done. That's why I wanted lucky
straight, I wanted luck to be on

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.560
her side.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.060
Wanted to Make sure that
nothing could go wrong.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.060
Yeah, well...

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.560
what you did was
stupid, it was...

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.160
Kari...

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.160
yuma's a great duelist.
He's definitely

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.290
got your old man's spirit.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.690
You be sure and tell him
that for me, would ya?

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.690
And, uh...

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.860
it was good to see you again.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.660
Later, Kari.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.230
Off for another globetrotting
adventure. Wish me luck.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.990
Heh, heh.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.030
Hey Tori, wanna go
grab a bite or something?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.330
Yeah!

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.730
I'm really hungry.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.460
Charlie is going to give us
that number card, right yuma?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.330
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.760
I think we really should
have stayed with them...

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.160
you feel like tacos or burgers?

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.430
I say tacos!

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.160
Yuma... yuma...

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.490
Good call!
