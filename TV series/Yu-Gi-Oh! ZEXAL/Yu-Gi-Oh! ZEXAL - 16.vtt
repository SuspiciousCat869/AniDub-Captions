WEBVTT

00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:04.875
YUMA: LAST TIME
ON YU-GI-OH! ZEXAL

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.411
ROKU: THE NAME HAPPENS
TO BE ROKU, BUT YOU

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:10.013
CAN CALL ME MASTER ROKU!

00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:12.048
ALL: "MASTER ROKU??"

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.555
ALL THE LEGENDARY
MONSTERS IN ONE PLACE!

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:19.956
WOW!

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:22.025
I POURED MY HEART
AND SOUL INTO MAKING

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.627
THESE WOODEN STATUES.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:27.264
DURING A DUEL, THESE
STATUES COME TO LIFE!

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:28.999
DO YOU WANT TO SEE?

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.500
HMM?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.637
GET SET TO GET DECKED OLD-TIMER!

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:38.675
I'M ACTIVATING, THE
STATUE ZONE FIELD SPELL!

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.211
TREMBLE AS MY BLUE-EYES
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.452
HUH?

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:51.822
HEY!

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.790
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.891
GET AWAY, MY BOY.

00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.959
UH.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:57.093
AWAY FROM WHAT?

00:00:57.093 --> 00:00:58.094
YOU MEAN THIS GUY?

00:00:58.094 --> 00:00:59.129
WHO IS HE?

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.766
KAZE, A FORMER PUPIL OF MINE.

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.136
KAZE: I'M THE MASTER NOW,
WHERE'S THE DECK?

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:08.205
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO THROUGH ME TO GET IT.

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:09.473
LET'S DUEL!

00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:12.676
WITH THESE TWO MONSTERS, I BUILD
THE OVERLAY NETWORK

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:16.613
AND XYZ SUMMON,
BLADE ARMOR NINJA!

00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:23.153
POOR FOOL.

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:24.988
IF YOU HADN'T TRIED TO
PROTECT YOUR MONSTER,

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.257
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN ANY DAMAGE AT ALL.

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:28.692
MY MONSTERS ARE MY FRIENDS.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.428
THEY'VE GOT MY BACK,
AND I'VE GOT THEIRS!

00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:33.964
YOUR "FRIENDS?" THAT
KIND OF THINKING WILL

00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:35.832
LEAD YOU TO YOUR UNDOING.

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:39.236
WELL THEN GIVE ME ALL YOU'VE
GOT AND LET'S FIND OUT!

ROKU!

00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:47.470
ONCE I DEFEAT THIS PATHETIC
STUDENT OF YOURS,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.974
I WILL TRULY BE THE MASTER OF
THIS DUEL SANCTUARY AND THE

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:54.911
LEGENDARY DECK YOU HOLD
SO DEAR WILL BE MINE.

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.780
AND THEN I WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.253
LOOK, SAMURAI GUY, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THIS LEGENDARY DECK IS

00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:06.790
ALL I KNOW IS THAT MASTER ROKU
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.092
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT!

00:03:09.092 --> 00:03:10.694
HMPH!

00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:13.630
YOU WOULD BE WISE TO RETHINK
THIS DUEL AND QUIT NOW.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.698
TRUST ME.

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:16.700
DO NOT STAND IN MY WAY.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.201
FOR IF YOU DO.

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:20.136
I WILL SHOW NO MERCY!

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:23.173
AND YOU WILL FEEL MY WRATH!

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:25.308
BRONK: SHOW HIM WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF, YUMA!

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:27.177
TORI: THIS GUY WAS YOUR STUDENT?

00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:29.012
WAS HE LIKE ANY GOOD?

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:31.247
HE WAS THE BEST STUDENT I'VE
EVER HAD UNTIL THE

00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:34.551
DARKNESS FILLED HIS HEART AND
CORRUPTED HIS SPIRIT.

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:36.519
BRING IT ON, YA' BIG WIND BAG!

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.555
I DRAW!

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:42.092
NOW IF I LOWER DODODO WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 500,

00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:43.960
I CAN SUMMON IT TO THE FIELD!

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.272
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO YOU?

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:59.909
IF YOU HAD TRIBUTED GAGAGA
MAGICIAN TO SUMMON DODODO

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.679
WARRIOR, IT WOULD'VE COME TO THE
FIELD WITH MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.681
THAN MY BLADE ARMOR NINJA.

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:07.317
WHY WOULD YUMA KEEP HIS MAGICIAN
IF IT MEANS MAKING DODODO

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:09.185
WARRIOR WEAKER?

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:14.090
ASTRAL: YUMA, DID YOU DO THAT
JUST TO PROTECT YOUR MAGICIAN?

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.592
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:17.727
I DO NOT.

00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:20.630
ALRIGHT, NEXT UP, I
ACTIVATE THE FULL-FORCE STRIKE

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.100
SPELL CARD FROM MY HAND!

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.203
WHEN OUR MONSTERS BATTLE,
NEITHER ONE OF US TAKES DAMAGE,

00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:30.607
BUT YOUR MONSTER
WILL BE DESTROYED!

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:33.610
NOW I'M GONNA ATTACK
YOUR BLADE ARMOR NINJA

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.478
WITH DODODO WARRIOR!

00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:39.382
GO DODODO AXE!

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.419
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.955
ARMOR NINJITSU ART OF FREEZING!

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.659
WHEN THERE'S A NINJA ON MY
FIELD, THIS TRAP NOT ONLY STOPS

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.261
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK.

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:54.564
BUT IT BINDS YOUR SO
CALLED FRIEND SO THAT IT

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:56.666
CAN'T CHANGE BATTLE MODE.

00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:00.937
THAT IS NOT GOOD.

00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:04.107
YOUR EFFORTS TO STOP ME ARE IN
VAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO FALL AND

00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:07.077
ROKU'S LEGENDARY
DECK WILL BE MINE!

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:14.217
YOU MIGHT HAVE MY BACK AGAINST
THE WALL, BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA

00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:17.754
BEAT ME OR GET MASTER
ROKU'S LEGENDARY DECK!

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:21.725
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:22.826
HMPH!

00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:24.527
IN THAT CASE - I DRAW!

00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:27.430
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL SPY ATTACK!

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.800
BY SENDING ONE MONSTER FROM MY
HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD, I GAIN

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.106
THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT A
FACEDOWN CARD ON YOUR FIELD!

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.440
AQUA ARMOR NINJA!

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.547
SNEAK INTO THE ENEMY'S DOMAIN
AND REVEAL HIS TACTICS!

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.050
UNLIKE YOU, KAZE SEEMS
TO HAVE NO PROBLEM

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.486
SACRIFICING HIS MONSTERS.

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:52.822
NOW SHOW ME YOUR CARD!

00:05:52.822 --> 00:05:54.858
INTERESTING

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:56.326
CAREFUL BOY.

00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:59.596
GRANDMA: DID YOU GET YUMA TO DO
ALL THIS CLEANING, ROKU?!

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.197
I'M IMPRESSED!

00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:04.434
I CAN'T EVEN GET HIM TO
STRAIGHTEN UP HIS ROOM!

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:07.437
HARU?

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:09.172
LONG TIME NO SEE!

00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:10.473
HEY THERE, KARI!

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:13.710
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING, YUMA!

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.545
UH-! KARI!?

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:18.047
DIDN'T WE HAVE A LITTLE TALK
ABOUT YOU DUELING!?

00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:19.315
WHAT'D I SAY?

00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:21.684
PUT YOUR KNUCKLES AWAY.

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:24.721
YOU CANNOT STOP YUMA FROM BEING
WHO HE IS ANY MORE THAN

00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:27.757
YOU CAN STOP THE
WIND FROM BLOWING.

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:31.861
AND AS A GROWING DUELIST, YOUR
BROTHER NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT.

00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:34.164
UUH, YEAH!

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:35.465
WHAT HE SAID.

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:36.966
YOU MUST REMAIN FOCUSED, YUMA.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:38.134
ON WHAT?

00:06:38.134 --> 00:06:40.770
HOW NICE OF YOUR FAMILY
TO GATHER LIKE THIS.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.607
THEY'RE JUST IN TIME TO WATCH
YOU SUFFER A BITTER DEFEAT!

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:47.610
BLADE ARMOR NINJA - ATTACK
GAGAGA MAGICIAN!

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.449
GO ELECTROMAGNETIC SWORD STRIKE!

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.053
SWIFT LIKE A HUMMINGBIRD, BLADE
ARMOR NINJA WHIRLS AROUND AS I

00:06:57.053 --> 00:07:00.256
USE ITS OVERLAY UNIT
TO ATTACK AGAIN

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:03.059
BID FAREWELL TO YOUR
FRIEND DODODO WARRIOR!

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:10.466
THANKS TO MY SPY ATTACK, I KNOW
THAT YOUR FACEDOWN CARD IS

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:13.937
GAGAGABACK, WHICH CAN RESURRECT
YOUR MONSTERS IN EXCHANGE FOR

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:17.040
600 LIFE POINTS EACH.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.310
USE IT, LITTLE GNAT, SAVE YOUR
PRECIOUS FRIENDS.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.744
DON'T DO IT, YUMA.

00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:24.347
THOSE MONSTERS AREN'T WORTH 600
LIFE POINTS, NOT WHEN YOU'RE

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:26.716
ALREADY DOWN SO LOW!

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:28.117
BRONK'S RIGHT

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:31.354
NOW LET'S REALLY TEST THE LIMITS
OF YOUR FOOLISH DEVOTION!

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:36.025
I REVEAL THE ARMOR NINJITSU ART
OF RUST MIST TRAP CARD!

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:39.195
AS LONG AS I HAVE A NINJA IN
PLAY, THE ATTACK POINTS OF EVERY

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.232
MONSTER YOU SUMMON
IS SLICED IN HALF!

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:46.636
ARE YOU STILL WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HONOR YOUR

00:07:46.636 --> 00:07:48.605
LITTLE FRIENDS, EVEN
WHEN THEY'RE RENDERED

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:49.939
WEAK AND USELESS?

00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:53.810
DO NOT LET THIS
DEVELOPMENT STOP YOU FROM

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.212
FOLLOWING THROUGH, YUMA,
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:58.248
AND LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.

00:07:58.248 --> 00:08:02.051
HE IS HOPING TO SHATTER YOUR
RESOLVE BY PROVING THAT EVERYONE

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.355
IS WILLING TO ABANDON THEIR
FRIENDS TO SAVE THEMSELVES.

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.923
I THINK HE IS WRONG.

00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:08.324
HE IS WRONG.

00:08:08.324 --> 00:08:12.128
I'M ACTIVATING THE
GAGAGABACK SPELL CARD!

00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:14.797
WHEN GAGAGA MAGICIAN IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE, THIS CARD

00:08:14.797 --> 00:08:17.333
CAN BRING IT BACK
ALONG WITH ITS FRIEND!

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:20.703
BOTH IT AND DODODO WARRIOR
RETURN TO THE FIELD

00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.608
AND NOW THE BUMMER PART... I
TAKE 600 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:28.811
FOR EACH ONE OF 'EM.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.151
OH NO!

00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.754
HE'S DOWN TO 300 LIFE POINTS

00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:38.855
NOW WHAT?

00:08:40.723 --> 00:08:44.627
YOU MAY HAVE REVIVED YOUR FALLEN
MONSTERS, BUT NOW THE POWER OF

00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:52.635
MY TRAP RUST MIST SLICES THEIR
ATTACK POINTS IN HALF!

00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:55.638
YOUR MOVE, LITTLE GNAT.

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.241
ARE YOU FEELING FOOLISH YET?

00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:00.777
YOUR MONSTERS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED
AND YOU'RE HANGING ON BY A VERY

00:09:00.777 --> 00:09:05.581
THIN THREAD, THE BOND YOU
HAVE WITH YOUR MONSTERS

00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.250
HAS MADE YOU WEAK.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.986
I THINK I'VE GOT
YOU FIGURED OUT.

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:12.588
THE REASON YOU KEEP SAYING THAT
FRIENDSHIP MAKES YOU WEAK?

00:09:12.588 --> 00:09:14.257
IS SIMPLE!

00:09:14.257 --> 00:09:17.093
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS, DO YA!?

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:20.797
WHY WOULD I BOTHER RELYING ON
ANYONE OTHER THAN MYSELF?

00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:23.266
I'M STRONG ENOUGH
TO STAND ON MY OWN!

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:26.569
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
BEFRIENDING ANY OF MY MONSTERS!

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:28.905
THE OLD MAN'S TEACHINGS
ARE NONSENSE!

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:31.374
DUELING IS ABOUT CONTROLLING
YOUR MONSTERS AND

00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:33.910
BENDING THEM TO DO YOUR WILL!

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.878
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:38.314
THAT IS NOT WHAT
DUELING IS ABOUT!

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:42.251
YOU TALK A BIG TALK,
LIKE YOU'RE FULL OF FIRE.

00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:44.787
BUT YOU'RE NOTHING MORE THAN A
CANDLE IN THE WIND,

00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:47.223
DESPERATELY TRYING TO HOLD ON

00:09:47.223 --> 00:09:52.428
SOON, YOU WILL BE EXTINGUISHED.

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:53.863
BRING IT ON.

00:09:53.863 --> 00:09:55.331
IT'S MY TURN!

00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:56.399
I DRAW!

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:57.767
ALL RIGHT!

00:09:57.767 --> 00:09:59.035
GET READY!

00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:03.840
BECAUSE I'M ACTIVATING THE
GAGAGA BOLT SPELL CARD!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.908
WITH GAGAGA MAGICIAN ON MY
FIELD, IT DESTROYS

00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:08.144
ONE OF YOUR CARDS!

00:10:08.144 --> 00:10:11.014
IT'S BEEN NICE KNOWIN'
YA, BLADE ARMOR NINJA!

00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:15.418
BUH-BYE!

00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:16.719
WHY, YOU LITTLE

00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:19.789
AND NOW GAGAGA MAGICIAN CAN
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:10:23.793 --> 00:10:25.995
WHILE WE'RE AT IT - DODODO
WARRIOR CAN ATTACK

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:28.097
YOU DIRECTLY, TOO!

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:32.602
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:36.105
I ACTIVATE AQUA ARMOR'S ABILITY
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:39.442
BY BANISHING THIS CARD, IT STOPS
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK!

00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:44.047
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

00:10:44.047 --> 00:10:46.082
SEE WHEN DODODO WARRIOR ATTACKS

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:49.652
IT CANCELS OUT ALL YOUR SPELLS,
TRAPS AND MONSTER EFFECTS!

00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:51.054
WHAT!?

00:10:51.054 --> 00:10:53.990
WITH RUST MIST AND AQUA'S
EFFECTS OUT OF THE PICTURE,

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.226
THERE'S NOTHING STANDING IN
DODODO WARRIOR'S WAY!

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:01.130
NOW ATTACK!

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.265
DODODO AXE!

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.108
YEAH!

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:14.544
SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING
IS COMING UP YUMA!

00:11:18.881 --> 00:11:21.150
NICE ONE, HUH?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.119
YOU TALK A LOTTA
TRASH AND ACT LIKE

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:25.421
FRIENDSHIP IS FOR LOSERS.

00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:28.558
BUT I BELIEVED IN MY FRIENDS AND
THEY CAME THROUGH FOR ME!

00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:32.095
I DIDN'T TOSS THEM ASIDE JUST TO
GAIN A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE!

00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:33.529
ROKU IS RIGHT!

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:35.865
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT
YOUR MONSTERS!

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:38.234
WHATEVER, SO YOU
LUCKED OUT THIS TIME.

00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:39.902
YOU THINK THAT PROVES SOMETHING?

00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:41.771
MARK MY WORDS, LITTLE GNAT.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:44.207
ONE DAY YOU'LL LOOK AROUND,
AND YOUR "FRIENDS"

00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:45.708
ARE GONNA BE GONE.

00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:49.679
IT'S JUST GONNA BE YOU, ALL
ALONE, WITH NO ONE TO RELY ON

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:52.448
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE SCARED AND
YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU HADN'T

00:11:52.448 --> 00:11:55.952
BEEN SO FOOLISH AS TO
DEPEND ON SOMEONE ELSE!

00:11:55.952 --> 00:11:59.088
AND NOW, I DRAW!

00:11:59.088 --> 00:12:04.460
I ACTIVATE A SPELL CARD!

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.831
THE POWER OF THIS SPELL DESTROYS
EVERY NINJITSU ART ON MY FIELD!

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.400
WHY WOULD YOU GO AND GET RID OF
YOUR OWN TRAPS LIKE THAT?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.505
BECAUSE DOING SO ALLOWS ME TO
DRAW TWO NEW CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:12:17.874 --> 00:12:19.575
JUST WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:22.545
WHEN YOU HAVE MONSTERS ON THE
FIELD BUT I DON'T, I CAN SUMMON

00:12:22.545 --> 00:12:24.947
EARTH ARMOR NINJA TO MINE!

00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:35.057
THIS STRATEGY WORRIES ME.

00:12:35.057 --> 00:12:38.094
NEXT, I ACTIVATE THE ARMOR
NINJITSU ART OF

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:40.062
REVIVAL SPELL CARD!

00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:44.934
THIS ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON ONE
NINJA FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:48.070
SO SAY HELLO TO
FLAME ARMOR NINJA!

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.541
AND WHEN IT IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED, ITS

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:54.510
LEVEL INCREASES BY 1!

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.645
WHOA.

00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:56.746
LOOK!

00:12:56.746 --> 00:12:58.247
HIS HAND, HE MUST
HAVE A NUMBER CARD!

00:12:58.247 --> 00:12:59.549
NO WAY.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.817
YOU TRIED HARD, BOY, BUT NOW?

00:13:01.817 --> 00:13:03.452
YOU ARE FINISHED!

00:13:03.452 --> 00:13:05.188
I'M GOING TO CRUSH YOU!

00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:10.359
I OVERLAY EARTH ARMOR NINJA
AND FLAME ARMOR NINJA!

00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:17.533
WITH THESE TWO MONSTERS, I
BUILD THE OVERLAY NETWORK,

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:21.337
I XYZ SUMMON NUMBER 12!

00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:24.273
CRIMSON SHADOW ARMOR NINJA!

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.452
UHM GULP.

00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:44.527
THE CRIMSON SHADOW HAS
SHOWN ME THAT TRUE POWER IS

00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:46.996
ABOUT RAGE AND MIGHT!

00:13:46.996 --> 00:13:49.832
STRENGTH ABOVE EVERYTHING!

00:13:49.832 --> 00:13:52.034
AW, MAN.

00:13:52.034 --> 00:13:56.038
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ENOUGH
LEFT IN ME TO TAKE ON A NUMBER

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:58.207
SO THIS IS THE MONSTER
THAT'S BEEN FEEDING

00:13:58.207 --> 00:14:01.310
OFF OF KAZE'S ANGER.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.345
NOW WHAT?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.117
PREPARE TO CRUMBLE IN THE
WAKE OF TRUE POWER!

00:14:08.117 --> 00:14:11.687
CRIMSON SHADOW ATTACK
GAGAGA MAGICIAN!

00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:12.688
I'M TOAST.

00:14:12.688 --> 00:14:14.590
NOT YET - YOUR TRAP CARD!

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.092
OH, YEAH, RIGHT!

00:14:16.092 --> 00:14:19.562
MY GUTS GUARD TRAP CARD CAN
FORCE CRIMSON SHADOW TO ATTACK

00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:22.565
DODODO WARRIOR INSTEAD
OF GAGAGA MAGICIAN!

00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:24.467
AND IT ALSO PROTECTS
DODODO WARRIOR FROM

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:26.035
BEING DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:37.780
NOW YOU FINALLY KNOW WHAT
TRUE POWER LOOKS LIKE.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.984
URGH, SAVED BY THE TRAP.

00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:45.921
BUT, NEXT TURN, IF I DON'T
MANAGE TO TAKE HIM OUT.

00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:47.790
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, YUMA!

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.527
WHAT THAT BOY NEEDS RIGHT NOW IS
A HEARTY BIT OF DUEL FUEL.

00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:54.764
NOBODY CAN WIN ON AN EMPTY
STOMACH, RIGHT, TORI?

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:57.233
I'M ON IT.

00:14:57.233 --> 00:14:58.668
TORI?

00:14:58.668 --> 00:14:59.935
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:03.105
NO PEPPY LINE ABOUT
HUGS AND SUNSHINE?

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:06.309
NO ROUSING SPEECH ABOUT CHUMMING
IT UP WITH YOUR MONSTERS?

00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:07.810
YUMA.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.579
DO NOT LET YOUR DOUBT OVERTAKE
YOU, REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE NOT

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:14.050
ALONE, YOU HAVE GOT
YOUR FRIENDS WITH YOU.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.420
WHEN YOU LEARN TO MAKE THAT FEAR
YOUR OWN, AND WHEN YOU MASTER

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.056
HOW TO TAME IT, ONLY
THEN WILL YOU TRULY BE

00:15:20.056 --> 00:15:22.858
ABLE TO MOVE A MONSTER.

00:15:22.858 --> 00:15:29.699
TO MOVE A MONSTER

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.269
I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOUR BACK
IS TO THE WALL, YOU MAY FEEL

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:34.570
OUTNUMBERED.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.871
BUT YOU ARE NOT.

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:38.074
WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS,
YOU ARE NEVER ALONE.

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:44.980
YOU CAN DO IT.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.951
YOU GUYS UP FOR THIS?

00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:50.553
YOU'RE RIGHT, ASTRAL.

00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:54.957
NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST,
WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER!

00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:57.827
IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STAND
WITH MY FRIENDS AND KICK

00:15:57.827 --> 00:16:00.329
SOME NINJA BUTT!

00:16:00.329 --> 00:16:01.364
YUMA!

00:16:01.364 --> 00:16:02.998
CATCH!

00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:04.800
DUEL FUEL!

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.936
YEAH, YOU ROCK, TORI!

00:16:12.007 --> 00:16:14.310
NOW I'M TOTALLY
FEELIN' THE FLOW!

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.947
IT'S MY TURN, I DRAW!

00:16:17.947 --> 00:16:19.048
YEAH!

00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:20.783
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:23.519
GET READY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
ABOUT to get Yuma-ed!

00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:30.593
MY DECREASE SPELL CARD LOWERS MY
MONSTER'S LEVEL BY 2!

00:16:30.593 --> 00:16:32.228
WHICH MEANS I CAN CHANGE
DODODO WARRIOR FROM A

00:16:32.228 --> 00:16:34.697
LEVEL 6 TO A LEVEL 4!

00:16:34.697 --> 00:16:39.068
WHICH MEANS I CAN OVERLAY GAGAGA
MAGICIAN AND DODODO WARRIOR!

00:16:39.068 --> 00:16:42.271
WHICH MEANS I CAN BUILD THE
OVERLAY NETWORK!

00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:45.307
WHICH MEANS I CAN XYZ SUMMON!

00:16:47.877 --> 00:16:52.214
HERE COMES NUMBER 39... UTOPIA!

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.854
YES!

00:16:58.854 --> 00:16:59.922
EVERYTHING IS SET-UP.

00:16:59.922 --> 00:17:01.257
YOU CAN DO THIS YUMA.

00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:02.458
YUP!

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:06.395
UTOPIA TAKE OUT
CRIMSON SHADOW ARMOR NINJA!

00:17:12.835 --> 00:17:14.904
GO RISING SUN SLASH!

00:17:23.312 --> 00:17:25.080
HOW DO YA' LIKE THAT!

00:17:28.684 --> 00:17:31.253
YOU WORM, YOU'RE NOTHING!

00:17:31.253 --> 00:17:33.656
YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT
ME LIKE THIS!

00:17:33.656 --> 00:17:37.226
BY USING ONE OVERLAY
UNIT, CRIMSON SHADOW

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:38.694
RETURNS TO THE FIELD!

00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:46.836
GOOD CAUSE NOW I GET TO THROW
DOWN THE REVENGE ATTACK SPELL!

00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:49.638
SO WHEN YOUR MONSTER ATTACKS,
BUT FAILS TO DESTROY ITS

00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:52.208
OPPONENT IN BATTLE,
REVENGE ATTACK ACTIVATES

00:17:52.208 --> 00:17:53.776
AND INCREASES ITS POWER.

00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:55.978
SO UTOPIA GAINS A THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS AND

00:17:55.978 --> 00:17:57.813
THE ABILITY TO ATTACK AGAIN!

00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:58.814
IT WHAT!?

00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:14.630
WHERE IS THIS
LIGHT COMING FROM!?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.199
I ALWAYS WANTED A
SKYLIGHT, BUT THIS IS

00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:20.436
THIS IS WHERE WE WIN THE DUEL!

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:22.338
UTOPIA!

00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:25.341
ATTACK WITH RISING SUN SLASH!

00:18:29.912 --> 00:18:31.180
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:45.961
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:16.825
YUMA!

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:18.193
NOT BAD, HUH GUYS!?

00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:20.396
WELL, I DARE SAY THAT SOMETHING
SEEMS TO HAVE LIFTED

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:21.997
YUMA'S DUELING SPIRITS.

00:19:21.997 --> 00:19:23.999
HE'S GOT THAT BOUNCE
IN HIS VOICE AGAIN.

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:27.803
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHO WE
HAVE TO THANK FOR THAT.

00:19:27.803 --> 00:19:30.139
I SIMPLY SHOWED YUMA
THE PATH, HE'S THE ONE

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:32.608
WHO ACTUALLY TOOK THE STEPS.

00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:35.244
WELL, I MEAN,
YEAH, IT WAS CLOSE

00:19:35.244 --> 00:19:37.980
ANY CLOSER AND YOU'D BE
THE ONE ON THE FLOOR!

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.182
NOT FUNNY.

00:19:58.167 --> 00:19:59.234
STOP YUMA!

00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:00.336
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:20:00.336 --> 00:20:02.371
YOU COULD GET HURT!

00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:04.206
GET OUTTA THE WAY.

00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:06.609
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SO
ANGRY AT, BUT WHATEVER IT IS

00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:10.713
SLICING THIS STATUE IN TWO
ISN'T GONNA MAKE IT BETTER.

00:20:10.713 --> 00:20:15.250
MASTER ROKU POURED HIS HEART AND
SOUL INTO MAKING THIS STATUE!

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.987
YOU DON'T GET TO DESTROY IT JUST
CAUSE YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY!

00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:27.696
I WAS BETRAYED ONCE
BY MY FRIENDS.

00:20:27.696 --> 00:20:29.431
I HAD NOWHERE TO TURN

00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:33.369
SO I CAME TO ROKU
SEEKING A NEW DIRECTION

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:37.272
HE SPOKE ABOUT RESPECTING MY
MONSTERS AND TRUSTING THEM, BUT

00:20:41.143 --> 00:20:48.250
I LASHED OUT IN ANGER.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.022
I JUST, I CAN'T DO IT, AFTER
WHAT I WENT THROUGH?,

00:20:53.022 --> 00:20:58.460
I JUST CAN'T, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO TRUST ANYONE.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.729
YOU CAN STILL LEARN HOW, MY BOY

00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:03.465
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE FOR THAT.

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:04.800
MASTER

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:15.878
KAZE IS GOING TO STAY HERE
AND CONTINUE HIS TRAINING.

00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:17.312
HEH!

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:19.882
MAYBE I'LL SWING BY SOMETIME AND
WE CAN DUEL AND THEN YOU CAN

00:21:19.882 --> 00:21:22.951
TEACH ME HOW TO WIELD THAT
SWORD LIKE A TRUE MASTER!

00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:24.553
WE'LL SEE.

00:21:28.724 --> 00:21:31.260
I SO YOU WERE DUELING
BEHIND MY BACK?

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.029
I'M JUST KIDDING,
YOU LITTLE DWEEB

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:39.702
FOR REAL - YOU CAN DUEL WHENEVER
YOU WANT TO, YUMA.

00:21:39.702 --> 00:21:40.803
YEAH!

00:21:40.803 --> 00:21:41.870
DID YA' HEAR THAT, BRONK?

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.339
I'M A FREE MAN!

00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:46.942
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THIS DECK, YUMA.

00:21:46.942 --> 00:21:49.712
THIS IS THE SANCTUARY'S
LEGENDARY DECK.

00:21:49.712 --> 00:21:53.515
I THINK YOU AND THE MONSTERS IN
HERE WILL GET ALONG SPLENDIDLY.

00:21:53.515 --> 00:21:55.851
REALLY?

00:21:55.851 --> 00:21:56.952
REALLY.

00:22:01.824 --> 00:22:03.258
THAT'S SO AWESOME, BUDDY.

00:22:03.258 --> 00:22:04.927
YOU CAN USE THOSE TO
STRENGTHEN UP YOUR DECK FOR THE

00:22:04.927 --> 00:22:06.495
WORLD DUEL CARNIVAL.

00:22:06.495 --> 00:22:07.529
AW, YEAH!

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:08.797
OOH!

00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:10.966
ARE YOU PLANNING ON
ENTERING A DUEL TOURNAMENT?

00:22:10.966 --> 00:22:12.101
UH-HUH!

00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:14.837
ME AND MY MONSTERS
ARE GONNA ROCK IT!

00:22:14.837 --> 00:22:16.972
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, ASTRAL?

00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:18.474
UH, ASTRAL?

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.013
IT SEEMS YUMA HAS
GOTTEN HIS CONFIDENCE BACK,

00:22:25.013 --> 00:22:26.648
THAT IS A GOOD THING.

00:22:26.648 --> 00:22:30.786
IF WE ARE TO DEFEAT KITE, WE
MUST BOTH BELIEVE WE CAN WIN.

00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:32.788
I MUST WORK ON THAT.
