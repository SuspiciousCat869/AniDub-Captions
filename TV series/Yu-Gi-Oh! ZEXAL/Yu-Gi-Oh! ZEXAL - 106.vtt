WEBVTT

00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.650
Last time
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.020
My name is Jinlon,
the guardian of the Number

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.655
here at Temple Draghos.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.525
If you are able to defeat me
and my fearsome dragon,

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:14.428
I will hand over this
ruins' Number as your trophy.

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:17.664
But if you lose, I take
your dragon instead,

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:20.500
is that understood?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.601
(together) Let's duel!

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.639
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.675
Number 46: Dragluon!

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:29.409
Look at that!

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.579
This must be the ruins' Number.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.650
I summon a monster
more savage than a supernova!

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.954
Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:43.657
This is the place...

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.027
The Mythyrian Number
must be up there.

00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:48.662
(Jinlon)
This duel
is really a test.

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.096
You faced my wall of defense,

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:51.665
as you call it,
and brought it down!

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:55.335
You played a good duel,
but playtime is over!

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:59.339

Kite's in bad shape.

00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:05.071
Jinlon's monster has way more
attack points than his!

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.341
Yes, and even if he somehow
destroyed Soul Drain Dragon,

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:12.145
Kite would get hit with half
of its attack points as damage,

00:02:12.145 --> 00:02:14.514
meaning Kite would
lose instantly.

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:16.216
There's nothing he can do.

00:02:16.216 --> 00:02:17.384
He's done for!

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:19.252
So Kite, tell me.

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:21.555
How do you plan to escape
this predicament

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.256
you find yourself in?

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:25.659
Go ahead and attack me
to find out.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.662
(laughs)
Unfortunately I cannot.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:31.398
Soul Drain Dragon won't
attack on the turn

00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:32.666
in which it's summoned.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.367
Now it's your move.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:35.035
Come now, Kite.

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.103
I'm eager to see
what you do next.

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:39.673
You stall like a chick
scared to leave its nest!

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:41.174
Make your move!
What's your hurry?

00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:44.945
Don't you know the sooner I go,
the quicker you'll lose?

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:45.445
Are you sure?

00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:48.515
This is but one of many
challenges ahead in your test,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:51.184
a test you must pass
to keep your dragon.

00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:52.652
So far, you are doing well,

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:56.489
but this next challenge
may change all of that.

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.591
(chuckles)

00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.659
Just think,
whether you pass or fail

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.029
your test all may be riding
on this next move.

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.297
No pressure or anything.

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:05.465
I've had it with your test.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.667
It's my turn to school you!

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.102
I draw!

00:03:09.102 --> 00:03:10.070
You can do it, Kite!

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.105
You may be right,
but he will have to make

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.408
just the right choice on
his turn or he will lose.

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:18.011
Well Kite, are you ready
to make your move?

00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.146
Yes, but you won't like it!

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:22.916
I activate the spell
Desperate Maneuver!

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:26.419
Now when I pay
800 life points...

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:32.659
Your monster's original attack
points are cut in half.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.128
So that means
Soul Drain Dragon loses

00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:37.631
2,000 attack points!

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.402
But hang on,
that's not all you lose!

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:44.671
See, since I lost
800 life points,

00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:46.940
your Soul Drain Dragon
is going to lose

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.542
another 800 attack points!

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:50.310
But Kite,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.681
My Soul Drain Dragon still
has 5,200 attack points.

00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.650
You are no match for me!

00:03:56.883 --> 00:04:00.487
Well maybe not just yet,
but my turn isn't over!

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:05.358
I activate the spell
Dragonic Divine!

00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:09.062
When there's a Level 8-or-above
Dragon on my field,

00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:10.563
by paying 1,000 life points,

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:14.968
I can bring back a spell
card that I used this turn.

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:15.602
So...

00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:20.306
Desperate Maneuver
returns to my hand.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.242
And since I lost
more life points,

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:25.645
Soul Drain Dragon's attack
points keep on dropping!

00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:27.681
Kite seems to be
steadily taking away

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:30.116
his opponent's monster's
attack points!

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.284
Yeah, but it's risky!

00:04:31.284 --> 00:04:32.352
He has to give up life points

00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:35.155
to lower Soul Drain Dragon's
attack points!

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:35.622
Uh-oh...

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:38.658
I don't like the direction
this duel is taking.

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:43.963
Now I activate my spell card
Desperate Maneuver again!

00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:47.600
I'll pay 800 life points.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.907
So your Soul Drain Dragon says
"adios" to 1,000 attack points!

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:57.177
And it doesn't stop here...

00:04:57.177 --> 00:05:00.280
You lose another
800 attack points!

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.382
Whoa, now
Kite's Galaxy-Eyes

00:05:02.382 --> 00:05:05.018
is more powerful
than Soul Drain Dragon!

00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.153
And now go,
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:13.059
Attack Soul Drain Dragon with
Photon Stream of Destruction!

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.538
Hey, show an old man
some mercy!

00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:27.540
You got this now, Kite!

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.575
No, not quite.

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:30.243
Do not be like a pompous
mother hen

00:05:30.243 --> 00:05:32.445
who counts her chicks
before they are hatched.

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:34.314
You may have struck
a blow against me,

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:35.615
but my loss is also my gain!

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:37.650
You see, when Soul Drain
Dragon is destroyed,

00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:41.621
you take half
its attack points as damage.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.427
(shouting)

00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:50.597
Oh, no, Kite!

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:56.102
Uh oh he only has 200
life points left!

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:58.104
I totally saw this coming.

00:05:58.104 --> 00:05:58.671
Really?
That's right.

00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:02.208
Kite had to lose many life
points so he could survive,

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:05.311
but at last he still
has life points.

00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:05.678
Wait, hold on!

00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:08.982
You mean I was the only one
who didn't figure this out?

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:09.883
It is quite common.

00:06:09.883 --> 00:06:13.219
You are typically
the last one to catch on.

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.154
Oh, yeah?

00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:16.589
Well I know something
that you don't!

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:17.157
Which is?

00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:20.393
That Kite's going to be
the one to win this duel!

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:21.661
I hope you are correct.

00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:24.330
But with merely 200
life points remaining,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.371
Kite's victory is unlikely.

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:32.672
With only 200 life points left,

00:06:32.672 --> 00:06:35.975
Kite's victory is highly
unlikely.

00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:37.677
(laughing)
What will you do next?

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:41.314
My Dragluon reappears since you
destroyed my Soul Drain Dragon.

00:06:41.314 --> 00:06:44.384
And like a nearsighted fox
caught in a hen house,

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:47.587
there is no way to escape!

00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:51.658
(dragon roaring)

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:53.526
I'd say you're wrong!

00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:54.594
Let me show you why...

00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:57.197
with the trap
Destruction Reward!

00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:59.032
When one of your monsters
is beaten,

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:00.667
if it was at Level 7 or higher,

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:02.402
this card lets me
draw two cards.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:05.371
Your Soul Drain Dragon
was a Level 8, so now

00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:09.676
I get to add
two cards to my hand!

00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:13.680
I place two cards face down
and end my turn.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.115
I must say, Kite,
it was very impressive

00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:17.650
that you defeated my dragon!

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.953
However the next challenge
in your test

00:07:19.953 --> 00:07:23.456
will be far more difficult!

00:07:23.456 --> 00:07:24.657
My turn!

00:07:24.657 --> 00:07:26.426
I draw!

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:29.662
I activate my Dragluon's
special ability!

00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:32.065
Now I would hate
for you to get lonely,

00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:35.101
but when Dragluon
has no Overlay Units

00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:37.670
and is the only Dragon
on my field,

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.075
I can take a Dragon
from your field.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.011
Ahh!

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:48.181
Needless to say, I'll be
stealing your Galaxy-Eyes!

00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:50.917
The next challenge in
your test is tough,

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:51.651
so here's a hint.

00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:54.220
If you do not want me to take
your Galaxy Eyes,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.557
you can pay half your life
points and destroy it instead!

00:07:57.557 --> 00:07:58.191
What will you do?

00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:02.095
You're losing your precious
Galaxy Eyes either way!

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.400
There is something
very strange about this place.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.506
I have never been here, yet
it feels oddly familiar.

00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:14.374
But why?

00:08:14.374 --> 00:08:16.042
What am I feeling?

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:16.976
So have you decided?

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:21.981
Will you hand over your
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon to me?

00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:26.252
Or will you choose to destroy
the monster yourself.

00:08:26.252 --> 00:08:27.053
The choice is yours.

00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:28.454
It's not a choice at all.

00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:31.357
Because, you see, the bond
between me and Galaxy-Eyes

00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:32.659
is stronger than you
could ever know!

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.161
Without me,
Galaxy-Eyes is nothing.

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.097
And without Galaxy-Eyes,
then I am nothing.

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:40.667
There's no way I'll
ever hurt my Galaxy-Eyes,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.037
no matter what corner
you back me into!

00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:45.038
Huh, suit yourself.

00:08:45.038 --> 00:08:48.675
In that case I'll take
your dragon!

00:08:48.908 --> 00:08:52.245
Do it, Dragluon!

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.653
But how will Kite get by
without his best monster?

00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:04.223
Perhaps it's best if you are
defeated by your dragon,

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:06.960
seeing as you
and your monster are so close!

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.065
Now Galaxy-Eyes, attack
Kite directly!

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:12.966
Not good!

00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:14.667
I fear this is the end!

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:15.668
It's attacking!

00:09:15.668 --> 00:09:16.669
Not for long.

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:21.140
I activate
the trap Destiny Break!

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.178
When your monster attacks me,
I get to draw a card!

00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:30.083
And if it's a monster card,
it stops your attack.

00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:34.420
I drew the card I needed,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.290
The monster Galaxy Knight!

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.662
You must be having
test-takers luck.

00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:45.598
That wasn't luck,
it was destiny.

00:09:45.598 --> 00:09:46.666
What do you mean?

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.501
That by believing in my deck

00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:51.671
I am sure to draw
just the cards I need.

00:09:51.671 --> 00:09:55.675
That's why I'm a dueling champ,
and you're a dueling chump!

00:09:55.675 --> 00:09:56.476
Oh, really?

00:09:56.476 --> 00:09:58.378
If you are so great,
let's see how you fare

00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:01.080
against my Dragluon's
remaining attack!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.249
Get ready to feel the heat!

00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:06.285
Attack Kite directly!

00:10:06.953 --> 00:10:10.523
Divine Fire Attack!

00:10:10.523 --> 00:10:11.090
Not so fast!

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.227
I activate Destiny
Break's effect again!

00:10:14.227 --> 00:10:15.161
Ugh!

00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:19.632
Which means I need
to draw another monster.

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:20.466
What do you know,

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:22.668
a second Galaxy Knight!

00:10:22.668 --> 00:10:24.170
Know what that means?

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.573
Dragluon's attack is negated!

00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:28.608
This can't be!

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:34.680
There's more, Destiny Break's
other effect activates.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.949
Now, after our
battle, I get to summon

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:41.320
the monsters that
this card let me draw!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.926
So say hello to my two Galaxy
Knights flying onto the field!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.664
Now I place one card face down
and then end my turn!

00:10:51.664 --> 00:10:53.933
Whoa, did you see
that move, Astral?

00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:55.068
Kite survived Jinlon's attack!

00:10:55.068 --> 00:11:00.506
That may be, but he will have to
do much more than that to win.

00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:04.077
This is the beginning
of your end!

00:11:04.077 --> 00:11:07.680
I draw!

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.316
Hm.
Mm?

00:11:10.316 --> 00:11:13.119
Now I activate the card

00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:15.922
Destiny Overlay!

00:11:15.922 --> 00:11:18.891

a monster on your field

to Xyz Summon together
with one of my own monsters.

00:11:22.428 --> 00:11:23.930
What did you say?

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.667
I overlay my two Level 8
Galaxy Knights

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.670
and the Galaxy-Eyes
that's on your field!

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.674
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:11:34.674 --> 00:11:36.642
and Xyz Summon!

00:11:36.642 --> 00:11:40.680
Now prepare to witness
the mightiest of monsters!

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.617
With the power of this beast,
the battle is over!

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:49.655
Say hello to Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:52.658
(dragon roars)

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.204
I really hope Yuma and
the other guys are okay.

00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:05.972
Me too.

00:12:05.972 --> 00:12:07.373
'Cause whatever's
going on up there

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:10.643
doesn't sound or look too good.

You didn't expect me to summon
Neo Galaxy-Eyes, did you?

00:12:20.553 --> 00:12:22.188
No, using the dragon
I took from you

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:25.291
and evolving it to duel against
me was well played indeed.

00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:29.662
And with its special ability,
it'll become even more powerful!

00:12:29.662 --> 00:12:30.296
Untrue.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:32.165
Your floating friend is right.

00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:36.969
Dragluon negates your
Galaxy Eyes' special abilities.

00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:41.407
I hope you weren't counting
on them to beat me, Kite.

00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:44.110
Neo Galaxy-Eyes doesn't
have enough attack points

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.678
to finish off Jinlon this turn.

00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:47.613
And that means Jinlon can use

00:12:47.613 --> 00:12:50.216
Dragluon's special
ability next turn

00:12:50.216 --> 00:12:52.385
to steal Neo Galaxy Eyes.

00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.187
So if Kite doesn't
win this turn,

00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.589
he loses the duel
and his dragon!

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:57.023
Relax!

00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:59.392
Just sit back
and enjoy the show.

00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:00.960
But Kite, you gotta win now!

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.297
There's no stopping me,
his Dragluon is ours.

I activate Overlay
Sentinel's special ability!

00:13:09.669 --> 00:13:11.437
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:13:11.437 --> 00:13:14.140
your Dragluon loses
500 attack points

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.345
for every Overlay Unit on
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:13:19.345 --> 00:13:22.982
My Neo Galaxy-Eyes
has three Overlay Units.

00:13:22.982 --> 00:13:26.986
So your Dragluon loses
1500 attack points!

00:13:26.986 --> 00:13:28.387
But I'm not through yet!

00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:29.989
In fact I'm just
getting started.

00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:33.226
I activate Overlay Booster's
special ability.

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:35.061
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:36.662
Neo Galaxy Eyes Photon Dragon

00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:40.666
gains 500 attack points
for every Overlay Unit it has!

00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:46.205
So Neo Galaxy-Eyes gets
1,500 extra attack points!

00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:47.273
Wait to go, Kite!

00:13:47.273 --> 00:13:51.177
And now, Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon,

00:13:51.177 --> 00:13:54.146
attack Dragluon!

00:13:54.146 --> 00:13:55.681
No, I think not.

00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:59.652
I activate the trap
Dragon Dance!

00:13:59.652 --> 00:14:03.022
By banishing two
Dragons from my graveyard,

00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:05.324
your Neo Galaxy Eyes
Photon Dragon

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:10.463
loses attack points equal
to their combined attack points!

00:14:10.463 --> 00:14:13.466
So I chose to banish my
Armed Protector Dragon

00:14:13.466 --> 00:14:16.535
and my Soul Drain Dragon!

00:14:16.535 --> 00:14:18.971
My two dragon's combined
attack points

00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:24.176
are exactly the same
as your Neo Galaxy-Eyes'!

00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:27.680
Oh no, Kite's dragon has
zero attack points now.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.015
Meaning Kite's hurting bad!

00:14:29.015 --> 00:14:32.551
That's right and I'll show
you just how right you are!

00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:38.024
Dragluon, finish Neo
Galaxy-Eyes and this duel!

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:41.661
Your test is over!

00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:44.664
I agree, you're about to lose!

00:14:44.664 --> 00:14:45.164
But how?

00:14:45.164 --> 00:14:49.669
By playing my next trap,
Galaxy Dragon Maelstrom!

00:14:49.902 --> 00:14:54.674
With it, your trap no longer
works against my dragon.

00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:00.212
No way!
Can it be?

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:00.646
Yes!

00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:02.348
Did you think I wasn't
ready for your last move?

00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:03.649
I saw it coming long ago.

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:06.452
Your strategies in this test
make one thing clear,

00:15:06.452 --> 00:15:08.287
you've always got
a trick up your sleeve.

00:15:08.287 --> 00:15:12.325
So I had a trap ready for
any of your surprises.

00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:14.627
You're a quick learner.
Yeah, I know.

00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:17.663
Now it's your turn
to learn all about

00:15:17.663 --> 00:15:21.944
Ultimate Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:29.642
Now Neo Galaxy Eyes, Ultimate
Photon Stream of Destruction!

00:15:29.642 --> 00:15:32.378
(dragon roars)

00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:36.482
(groaning)

00:15:39.552 --> 00:15:41.654
(dinging)

00:15:41.654 --> 00:15:45.624
All right, you beat
Jinlon, Kite!

00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:50.963
(chuckling)

00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:52.932
Well, congratulations, Kite.

00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:54.667
You have passed
and won our duel!

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.503
I must know,
why did you test me?

00:15:57.503 --> 00:15:59.004
The answer to that question

00:15:59.004 --> 00:16:03.008
lies in the legend
of this temple.

00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:05.478
Why, is it a story about Mizar?

00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:06.345
(gasps)

00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:08.681
Yes, but much more as well.

00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:11.617
The story began
not far from here.

00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:14.186
Long ago, there stood
a village.

00:16:14.186 --> 00:16:16.522
The people lived
in peace and harmony,

00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:20.426
for they were protected by
a noble and mighty dragon.

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:23.496
But it was not the lone
guardian of the village.

00:16:23.496 --> 00:16:27.366
The great monster battled
alongside its closest friend,

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.901
a warrior named Mizar.

00:16:28.901 --> 00:16:34.306
Together they made
a formidable defense.

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.041
But dark times were ahead.

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.110
A terrible flood
struck the land,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.281
leaving only calamity
and sorrow in its wake

00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:44.216
Soon a mysterious
shaman arrived

00:16:44.216 --> 00:16:46.652
with a voice as hypnotic
as an evening dream,

00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:50.055
he declared that the dragon
had caused the disaster.

00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:53.092
The people were led astray
by the charlatan's lies

00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:55.661
and turned on
their guardian, the dragon.

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:57.630
They marched against
the monster,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.565
ready to destroy it for good.

00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:02.268
Mizar knew in his heart
the dragon was not to blame.

00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:07.106
He tried to convince the people,
but his pleas were not heard.

00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:10.176
The people demanded
Mizar destroy the dragon.

00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:12.678
To appease them, Mizar
betrayed his heart

00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:14.513
and turned on his best friend,

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:18.651
and after a brutal battle,
the dragon was defeated.

00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:20.953
Now without the dragon
to defend them,

00:17:20.953 --> 00:17:24.056
the village
was ruthlessly attacked!

00:17:24.056 --> 00:17:27.927
The Shaman was an imposter sent
by the village's enemies.

00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:29.895
He turned Mizar
and the villagers

00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.664
against the dragon.

00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:35.968
So you see Kite, Mizar's legend
is the reason why I tested you.

00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:40.005
I needed to see that you would
follow your heart, unlike Mizar.

00:17:40.005 --> 00:17:43.142
He ignored his heart
and betrayed the noble dragon,

00:17:43.142 --> 00:17:45.978
leading his village
to fall into ruin.

00:17:45.978 --> 00:17:47.980
Silence, you fool!

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.380
(gasps)

00:17:52.384 --> 00:17:54.286
No, it can't be!

00:17:54.286 --> 00:17:58.591
Well, look who it is.

00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:01.026
Mizar, it is you!

00:18:01.026 --> 00:18:02.294
I sense it!

00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:04.630
After all this time...

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.998
you're unchanged!

00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:12.204
My form is different,
but you know who I am.

00:18:12.204 --> 00:18:15.941
Enough, old man!

00:18:15.941 --> 00:18:20.279
How dare you imply that I
was once a filthy human?

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.248
Hey, what's your problem?

00:18:22.248 --> 00:18:22.681
Mizar!

00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:28.287
You skipped out on our last
duel, and I want a rematch!

00:18:29.622 --> 00:18:31.190
For once we agree.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.359
Because the time has come
for you to fall

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:36.595
to my Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyyon Dragon!

00:18:36.595 --> 00:18:40.933
(rumbling)

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:42.234
What is happening?

00:18:42.234 --> 00:18:44.103
(gasping) Watch out!

00:18:44.103 --> 00:18:48.674
<i>Whoa! I'm not readyfor the scrap heap!</i>

00:18:48.674 --> 00:18:51.510
This place trembles
at my power.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.679
Our duel must wait.

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:59.051
But this is not over!

00:18:59.051 --> 00:19:02.888
Far from it.

00:19:09.662 --> 00:19:13.198
Hey, where'd it go?

00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:15.668
The ruins, they disappeared!

00:19:15.668 --> 00:19:19.104
It looks like Jinlon
has vanished too.

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.679
Whoa, it's my dad's coin.

00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:27.680
Fellow duelists!

00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:29.582
There is more to my tale.

00:19:29.582 --> 00:19:31.617
From afar,
the dragon looked down

00:19:31.617 --> 00:19:33.519
upon the destroyed village
and wept.

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:36.522
It vowed never to let
such tragedy strike again.

00:19:36.522 --> 00:19:39.959
And the name of that dragon
was Dragluon.

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:43.295
♪ ♪

00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:49.368
But when I take human form,

00:19:49.368 --> 00:19:52.404
I am known as Jinlon.

00:19:52.404 --> 00:19:57.676
When duelists win a Mythyrian
Number, they gain great power.

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.078
Before granting it to you,

00:19:59.078 --> 00:20:02.047
I needed to see
that you follow your heart.

00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:03.382
And indeed you do.

00:20:03.382 --> 00:20:05.651
You have proven
yourself worthy.

00:20:05.651 --> 00:20:07.653
And you have taught me so much.

00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:10.422
I have one final lesson
to teach you.

00:20:10.422 --> 00:20:13.626
Long ago, I bore witness
to an epic battle

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:17.162
between the forces
of good and evil.

00:20:17.162 --> 00:20:20.666
The combat waged
fiercely for 100 days

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.468
and 100 nights.

00:20:22.468 --> 00:20:25.404
Fire rained onto the ground

00:20:25.404 --> 00:20:30.676
and lightning split the land
as the two forces collided.

00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:35.648
Then, in the end,
vanished without a trace.

00:20:37.116 --> 00:20:38.651
Yes, I remember now.

00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:44.456
I have battled against
the Barians before.

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:51.664
Kite, I entrust you
with this Number.

00:20:53.198 --> 00:20:57.136
Foolish battles only lead
the world to destruction.

00:20:57.136 --> 00:21:02.675
Learn from the past so you
are not doomed to repeat it.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.188
At long last, the moment
has finally arrived.

00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:18.657
I know my true purpose.

00:21:18.657 --> 00:21:21.160
I have to carry out a mission

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.364
to destroy Barian World.
