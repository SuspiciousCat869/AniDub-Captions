WEBVTT

00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:06.302
(Yuma)
So, Alito and Girag used this
place as their hideout?(Ray Shadows)
Yes, that's right.

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.722
Well, it doesn't look like
anybody's been here lately.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.326
We won't find any clues here.

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:15.411
Leave the investigating to me,
Junior Deputy Yuma.

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.381
You're a rookie, so keep
your opinions to yourself.

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.351
A rookie?

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.553
But if you work hard
and carry out all my orders,

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:27.423
you can earn
yourself one of these.

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.825
An official Barian
police badge.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.494
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:35.497
By the way, how is Astral?

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:38.667
I don't know.

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:41.503
I haven't seen him since
we dueled against Girag.

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:43.806
His body must still
be healing, I guess.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.642
I see.

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.110
Well, when Astral does show up,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.812
don't tell him I'm with
the Barian Cosmic Crime Unit.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.382
That won't be easy.

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:55.084
I don't like keeping
secrets from my friends.

00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:57.553
That's an order.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:00:58.721
Astral's safety depends on it.

00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.657
Yes, sir, sir!
Understood!

(Astral)
The Numbers that are being used
by the Barians

00:02:06.288 --> 00:02:08.590
are far more
powerful than any monsters

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.759
Yuma and I have faced before,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.761
especially when they evolve
into Chaos Numbers.

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.330
We will
not continue winning our duels

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.599
unless I find a way to become
stronger, but how?

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.208
What is happening?

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:27.609
The Numbers...

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.712
It seems as if they are trying
to communicate with me.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:33.649
(Number 96) Astral!

00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:37.786
You! Number 96!

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:40.456
You are not powerful enough
to defeat the Barians.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:43.826
I thought I had finally
seen the last of you.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:46.829
Well, luckily for you,
you were wrong.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.531
You need my aid, Astral,
and you know it.

00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.800
Release me from the confines
of this Key and in return,

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:55.104
I will lend you my help.

00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:56.305
You know I will not
accept your offer.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.541
Do not dismiss me so quickly.

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.810
I know that you are stumbling
around hopelessly in the dark.

00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:05.814
You do not have the strength
to continue on alone.

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:08.517
You need me.

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:09.818
Face the facts, Astral.

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:11.487
You may be light,
but I am darkness.

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:14.189
Light can only
shine in the dark.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.391
Without me, you will
never be complete!

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.527
Hey, Astral, are you there?

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:22.798
(Teacher)
This single-celled organism
is a wonder of nature...

00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:24.800
(Yuma) Astral, can you hear me?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.801
C'mon answer me, please!

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:28.303
Yuma, can't that
wait till after class?

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:31.406
No, I have to find out
if Astral is okay.

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:34.309
Hey, I know!

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.745
Excuse me, but I need to go
to the nurse's office, pronto!

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.815
The sudden reappearance of
Number 96 is disturbing.

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:43.819
I wish I could make
sense of it all,

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.155
but my mission remains
as mysterious as ever.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.262
(Door)
Astral...
are you worthy?

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.799
What is this place?

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.100
Your time is now.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.802
Your time is now, Astral...

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:01.804
For what?

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.505
Tell me.

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:04.807
Explain.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:06.108
Pass this test and your
path will be revealed.

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:09.411
Fail, and all will be lost.

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.347
All will be lost?

00:04:12.347 --> 00:04:14.516
What must I do?

00:04:19.254 --> 00:04:22.524
Who are you?

00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:24.726
I am the one who will
challenge your limits!

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.730
You must duel me!

00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:32.634
Astral, please!

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:35.204
Come out of the Key!

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:36.805
I'm worried about you!

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.807
(Yuma)
He's still
not answering.

00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:39.808
I bet he's really sick!

00:04:39.808 --> 00:04:41.443
We have to do something!

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:43.345
Calm down, please.

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:45.414
You'll be okay, pal!

00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:46.815
Just relax!

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.383
I'll ask the nurse
to take your temperature!

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:51.353
Chill out!

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:52.721
I'm sure it's all gonna
be okay, Yuma.

00:04:53.055 --> 00:04:55.224
Hey, what's
going on? Whoa!

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.394
(Tori)
Whatever it is,
it can't be good!

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.102
Hey, where's Yuma?

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:08.804
He's gone!

00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:10.672
Whoa! Whoa!

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.821
Wait a minute, where am I?

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:28.123
Astral!

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:30.826
Does this mean we're
inside the Golden Key?

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.462
Yes.

00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:34.463
Did you bring me here?

00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:36.098
No, you were brought
here by him.

00:05:36.098 --> 00:05:38.734
Whoa!
Who is that?

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.702
(Astral)
It appears I am
to be tested.

00:05:40.702 --> 00:05:42.738
In order to further my mission,

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.039
I must defeat this warrior.

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.208
Is he a Barian?

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:47.809
He is not.

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:49.244
Nevertheless, I must beat him
to regain a crucial memory.

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:52.514
Be warned!

00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:53.615
Losing will have grave
consequences.

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:56.051
Well then, it's a good thing
all I know how to do is win!

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.521
Duel Disk go!

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:07.596
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.098
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:14.336
Let us see how you
handle adversity.

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:17.239
Will you overcome it
or will it destroy you?

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:20.709
I draw!

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:22.244
I begin by summoning
Bubble Breeder!

00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:28.750
I will then send this card
to my graveyard.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.620
This allows me to summon another
Bubble Breeder from my hand,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.624
which I will do without delay!

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:38.460
And now I activate
Monster Reborn!

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.763
I will use it to return

00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:42.831
a third Bubble Breeder
from my graveyard!

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.767
This guy isn't fooling around.

00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:48.470
Indeed, I will use
all my might against you!

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.807
I overlay all three
Bubble Breeders

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:54.743
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:06:54.743 --> 00:06:57.813
I Xyz Summon Unformed Void!

00:07:03.452 --> 00:07:07.089
But it has no attack points!

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:08.824
And that should worry us.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:10.826
I activate my field
spell Overlay World!

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:14.529
At the end of each turn, any
duelist without an Xyz Monster

00:07:14.796 --> 00:07:18.300
takes 500 points of damage,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.502
and any destroyed Xyz Monsters
will be banished!

00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:24.206
I now end my turn.

00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:26.408
That's really gonna limit
our options in this duel.

00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:30.078
This will be most challenging.

00:07:35.817 --> 00:07:39.621
It's already hitting
us up for damage!

00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:42.424
But no matter what...

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.059
We're gonna win this thing!

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.728
Together, we can do this!

00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:49.431
That's right, we summon

00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.766
Dododo Warrior!

00:07:50.766 --> 00:07:52.801
By lowering its attack
points by 500,

00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:55.370
we can summon it
without tributing!

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.173
(Both)
And then we will
use a spell.

00:07:58.173 --> 00:08:00.208
Fourcing!

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:02.077
(Astral)
By sending a card in our hand
to the graveyard,

00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:04.613
we can summon
a Level 4 Spellcaster.

00:08:04.813 --> 00:08:07.516
We're saying goodbye
to Ganbara Lancer.

00:08:08.617 --> 00:08:11.453
And hello to Gagaga Magician!

00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.423
Next, we use the spell
Monster Reborn!

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:19.594
That'll let us bring
back Ganbara Lancer!

00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.735
When we Xyz Summon,
Ganbara Lancer

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:29.271
will count as two monsters!

00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:30.772
Yeah, we Overlay our
two Ganbara Lancers

00:08:30.772 --> 00:08:33.542
in order to build
the Overlay Network

00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:35.610
and Xyz Summon Number 61:
Volcasaurus!

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:54.830
Yuma, summon another
Number at once!

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.399
I activate Gagaga Magician's
special ability,

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:00.802
changing its Level from 4 to 6!

00:09:00.802 --> 00:09:03.371
Now I can overlay Gagaga
Magician and Dododo Warrior!

00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:06.808
I Xyz Summon Number 6:
Chronomaly Atlandis!

00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:25.827
Cool!

00:09:25.827 --> 00:09:27.229
With that, we can
get the upper hand!

00:09:27.229 --> 00:09:29.131
Indeed, the time to act is now.

00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.800
Let's go!

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.068
I activate Atlandis's
special ability!

00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:36.671
By using this Overlay Unit,

00:09:36.671 --> 00:09:38.340
it wipes out half
your life points!

00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:41.810
Go, Atlandis!

00:09:42.043 --> 00:09:44.446
Orichalcum Gate!

00:09:48.517 --> 00:09:51.786
Oh, yeah!

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:53.288
That worked perfectly!

00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:55.357
Now let's attack him
with our Numbers!

00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:57.726
I activate Unformed Void's

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.228
special ability!

00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:02.531
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:04.432
all your Xyz Monsters'
attack points

00:10:04.432 --> 00:10:06.501
are added to my Unformed Void!

00:10:31.092 --> 00:10:34.763
Whoa! Now it's
super powerful!

00:10:34.763 --> 00:10:38.166
He appears to have
turned the tables on us.

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:41.102
Yeah, maybe so.

00:10:41.102 --> 00:10:42.771
But now we can turn the
tables right back on him!

00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:46.107
I activate Volcasaurus'
special ability!

00:10:46.107 --> 00:10:49.678
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:51.479
Volcasaurus destroys
your monster

00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:53.782
and deals you damage equal to

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:55.483
the destroyed monster's
attack points!

00:10:55.483 --> 00:10:58.353
This duel's all done!

00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:00.188
No.

00:11:00.188 --> 00:11:01.823
His monster should've
been totally vaporized!

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:07.095
Overlay World's effect
makes that impossible.

00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:09.764
While this field is active,

00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:11.233
no spell, trap,
or special ability

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:13.335
can destroy Xyz Monsters!

00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:15.237
Well, that figures.

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:17.339
Guess I'll have to
end my turn then.

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:19.808
It's my move!

00:11:19.808 --> 00:11:21.376
I draw!

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.744
Unformed Void attack Atlandis!

00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:26.081
Since it is a Number,
it cannot be destroyed.

00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:29.117
Yeah, you're right!

00:11:29.117 --> 00:11:30.652
When Unformed Void attacks,

00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:32.320
it puts an end
to any special abilities

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.389
that prevent your monster's
destruction.

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:36.658
Oh, no!
It's gonna take
out our Number!

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:52.474
He counters every
single move we make.

00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:55.076
We are not strong enough.

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:02.183
You will not win until you
accept the one thing you lack.

00:12:02.183 --> 00:12:04.819
You need... my help!

00:12:06.388 --> 00:12:09.824
What does this guy
want, Astral?

00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:11.826
He's nothing but trouble!

00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:12.827
You have me all wrong.

00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:14.796
I am here to help.

00:12:14.796 --> 00:12:15.830
This opponent is testing Astral

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.465
in order to see if he is worthy
of keeping the Numbers.

00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:20.602
Worthy?

00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:21.603
That doesn't make any sense.

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:22.804
Why would that guy care if
Astral has the Numbers?

00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:26.675
Astral, you know I am right.

00:12:26.675 --> 00:12:29.811
You also know that you need
my power to defeat him.

00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:33.281
What does he mean we
need his power, Astral?

00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.251
It is true.

00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.686
I have things
that Astral lacks.

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:40.188
Anger, envy, malice.

00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:43.191
You need them all to win!

00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:45.293
We don't need any of that
stuff and we never will!

00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:48.763
Or so you think.

00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:51.399
Take my advice and
think it over carefully

00:12:53.568 --> 00:12:56.171
before you turn
me down, Astral.

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.773
Just remember...

00:12:58.773 --> 00:13:00.375
this is not the human world.

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.744
I wonder what will happen to
your friend Yuma if you lose?

00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:06.348
Astral, he's wrong!

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:08.083
We can win this without
anyone's help!

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.685
It's my turn!

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:12.220
I draw!

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.122
I'm putting a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:13:14.122 --> 00:13:17.092
And then I'll switch
Volcasaurus to defense mode.

00:13:18.693 --> 00:13:20.428
I activate Unformed Void's
special ability!

00:13:22.497 --> 00:13:26.167
Now the attack points of
your Xyz Monster are added

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:29.604
to Unformed Void's
attack total!

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:38.313
No way! Not again!

00:13:43.418 --> 00:13:47.288
It's getting stronger
with every turn.

00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:49.824
Yuma, place that card down.

00:13:49.824 --> 00:13:52.360
I'm putting one card facedown
and ending my turn!

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.230
It is my move!

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.799
Unformed Void,
destroy Volcasaurus!

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:14.816
I end my turn!

00:14:14.816 --> 00:14:18.219
We have no Xyz Monsters,

00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:20.088
so Overlay World's effect
will strike us again!

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:33.802
This next turn
will be our last.

00:14:33.802 --> 00:14:36.271
Unless we summon
an Xyz Monster,

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:38.473
the field spell's effect will
erase all our life points.

00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:41.810
But if we do bring an Xyz
Monster onto our field,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.113
the strength his monster
gains will be devastating,

00:14:45.113 --> 00:14:48.082
both for myself and for Yuma!

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:54.489
(Number 96)
This is not the human world.

00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:57.158
I wonder what will happen to
your friend Yuma if you lose?

00:14:57.592 --> 00:15:00.829
(Astral) Yuma.

00:15:02.831 --> 00:15:06.267
All right, Number 96!

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:08.770
I will free you!

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.171
No, Astral, you can't!

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:12.307
Please don't do this!

00:15:12.307 --> 00:15:14.309
Number 96,
make sure you fulfill

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:17.679
your end of our bargain!

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:26.754
Why, Astral?

00:15:26.754 --> 00:15:28.423
Why are you teaming
up with him?

00:15:28.423 --> 00:15:31.459
I promised that I would help you
win this duel and I will.

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:34.829
You must summon Dark Mist...
quickly!

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:38.366
No, I won't!

00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:39.801
You must! It is the
only way we can win!

00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:47.242
(Yuma) All right, then.

00:15:47.242 --> 00:15:49.811
My move!

00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:51.412
First, I'll summon
my facedown monster.

00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:55.116
Magical Undertaker
is on the job!

00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:57.585
Then I'll have it use
its special ability!

00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:03.057
It lets me summon a Spellcaster
from my graveyard

00:16:03.057 --> 00:16:05.827
as long as
it's Level 4-or-below.

00:16:05.827 --> 00:16:08.830
Come back, Gagaga Magician!

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.100
And whenever a Dark Attribute
monster is on my field,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.270
I can summon this monster
from my hand!

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.139
Caligo Claw Crow!

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:21.309
Now use your ability, Gagaga!

00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:23.778
Change from Level 4 to Level 2!

00:16:23.778 --> 00:16:27.248
Now summon Dark Mist and
I will seal our victory!

00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:31.085
Do it!
Now.
All right!

00:16:31.085 --> 00:16:32.720
I Overlay my Level 2 Gagaga
Magician, Caligo Claw Crow,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.724
and Magical Undertaker in order
to build the Overlay Network!

00:16:36.824 --> 00:16:40.728
I Xyz Summon Number 96:
Dark Mist!

00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:01.249
Your troubles are over!

00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:12.226
Your troubles are over!

00:17:12.226 --> 00:17:13.828
Dark Mist will eliminate
all who stand in our way!

00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:17.231
Dark Mist,
attack Unformed Void!

00:17:18.132 --> 00:17:19.801
I activate Dark Mist's
special ability!

00:17:21.803 --> 00:17:25.273
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:17:25.273 --> 00:17:27.408
Dark Mist steals half of
Unformed Void's attack points!

00:17:27.742 --> 00:17:31.045
Shadow Gain!

00:17:36.584 --> 00:17:40.555
Now activate that trap card
while you have a chance!

00:17:40.555 --> 00:17:43.825
I'm activating Battle Restart!

00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:47.128
(Astral)
If a battle has
already commenced,

00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:48.796
this card restarts the battle!

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:51.466
Perfect.

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:52.800
This allows Dark Mist
to use Shadow Gain again!

00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:56.437
Be merciless, Dark Mist!

00:17:56.437 --> 00:17:58.506
Drain away half of
Unformed Void's attack points

00:17:58.506 --> 00:18:00.708
so that you can grow stronger!

00:18:07.215 --> 00:18:10.818
And now we can finish him off!

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:13.121
Convinced yet?

00:18:13.121 --> 00:18:15.156
Surely you must see now
that you do need my power...

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:18.726
the power of darkness!

00:18:18.726 --> 00:18:21.295
Go, Dark Mist!

00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:22.697
Destroy Unformed Void!

00:18:22.697 --> 00:18:25.266
Whiplash Whirlwind!

00:18:47.422 --> 00:18:51.192
You have proven yourself
worthy, Astral.

00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:54.595
Your path will now be revealed.

00:18:58.032 --> 00:19:01.536
Hold up, where are we now?

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:03.337
The Door has put us on the path
to enlightenment, Yuma.

00:19:03.337 --> 00:19:06.808
I finally understand what the
Numbers have been telling me.

00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:14.148
Of course, yes,
it all makes sense.

00:19:15.817 --> 00:19:17.051
Yuma, I remember now!

00:19:21.489 --> 00:19:24.826
There is a card that contains

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:26.360
the meaning of the
entire universe.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.731
Within it can be found any
answer you could possibly seek!

00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:33.301
Everything from the
origins of time itself

00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:35.436
to the ultimate destiny
of all reality.

00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:38.806
Wait, all that
stuff's... in a card?

00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:42.577
It is a very
special card, Yuma.

00:19:42.577 --> 00:19:44.479
The card is so powerful
that it can determine

00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:46.547
the fate of every world.

00:19:46.547 --> 00:19:48.816
This may be hard
for you to understand

00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:50.752
and even harder for you
to believe.

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:52.687
It is the card that created
our whole universe...

00:19:53.287 --> 00:19:56.691
The Numeron Code.

00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:58.826
Where is it?

00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:01.829
As we collect
the remaining Numbers,

00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:04.098
we will learn
the card's location.

00:20:04.098 --> 00:20:06.234
The Barians are desperately
seeking this card,

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:09.070
but I must obtain it first!

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:14.809
Whoa, not again!

00:20:19.347 --> 00:20:22.517
Tori!

00:20:22.517 --> 00:20:23.818
Yuma!

00:20:23.818 --> 00:20:25.219
What a relief!

00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:27.522
(Tori)
Astral! You're okay!

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:30.258
What's that?

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.395
Astral, you kept your word
and set me free.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.800
Thank you.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.434
And I promise you,

00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:41.803
there will come a day

00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:43.704
when you need my dark powers
once more.

00:20:43.704 --> 00:20:46.808
We will meet again.

00:20:47.675 --> 00:20:48.543
Well, that was weird.

00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:52.780
What was that thing?

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.816
(Tori) Are you serious?

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:56.651
You guys actually had a duel
inside your Key?

00:20:57.351 --> 00:21:00.555
Yeah.

00:21:00.555 --> 00:21:01.789
That Astral look-alike
helped us win.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:04.625
And after that, me and Astral

00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:06.194
were transported
to some passageway.

00:21:06.194 --> 00:21:08.262
It was there we saw

00:21:08.262 --> 00:21:10.331
a super mysterious card
called Numeron Code.

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:13.668
Numeron Code?

00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:16.804
Sounds important.

00:21:16.804 --> 00:21:18.806
Number 96 seemed certain

00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:21.676
that I would
ask for his help again.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:23.811
Will I truly need his powers
to carry out my mission?

00:21:23.811 --> 00:21:27.315
Am I destined to draw upon his
darkness in the future?
