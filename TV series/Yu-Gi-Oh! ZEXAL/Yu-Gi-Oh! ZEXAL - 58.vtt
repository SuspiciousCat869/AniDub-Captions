WEBVTT

00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:02.644
(Yuma)
Last time
on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.178
(Mr. Heartland)
It's time to
turn up the heat!

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.244
Ladies and
gentlemen,

00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:11.077
may I present to you,
the Magma Field!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.544
And it looks like Quattro
and Shark are headed there

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.577
for a fiery faceoff!

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:17.611
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.277
(Shark)
With these
three monsters,

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.711
I build the Overlay Network,
and Xyz Summon!

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:25.444
Number 32,
Shark Drake!

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:29.011
(Quattro)
That Number,
It belonged to Trey.

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:32.277
Did Vetrix use Trey to
pass the Number to Shark?

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.244
Has he been plotting
this duel the whole time?

00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:36.444
Why yes.

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.144
Didn't I
mention it?

00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:40.011
(laughing)

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:42.944
I intend for the Number
Shark Drake to consume Shark.

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:44.777
That will make him
prone to my influence,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.644
and I can use him
to finish Dr. Faker.

00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:50.411
You're not using me for
anything, understand?

00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:51.711
But why Vetrix?

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:53.844
Why have you chosen
Shark, why not me?

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.944
Each person has their own
role to fill in my plans.

00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.911
But to be quite clear, you
are not the stronger duelist.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.084
That honor
goes to Shark.

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.084
You're wrong!

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:03.684
I will never
accept that!

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.384
(Quattro)
I overlay Level 8
Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker

00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:09.784
and Gimmick Puppet
Magnet Doll!

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.651
And Xyz Summon,

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:15.217
Number 40: Gimmick
Puppet of Strings!

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.017
Prepare to be
petrified

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:19.651
because now I equip
Gimmick Puppet of Strings

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:23.784
with the spell
String of Destiny!

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:27.017
Now, attack Gimmick Puppet,
with Celestial Slash!

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:32.517
Ahh...

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:36.117
(Quattro)
I activate Gimmick Puppet of
Strings' special ability!

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:37.551
At the end of
your next turn,

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:39.751
the String Counter will
destroy Shark Drake,

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:41.884
and your chances
of winning!

Shark, wake up!

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:51.024
I gotta help him.

00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:52.791
Can you get me out
of this chain, Astral?

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:54.924
(Vetrix)
No one can free
you but me.

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.857
(laughing)

00:02:57.924 --> 00:02:59.191
(Vetrix)
And right now Yuma,

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.831
I think I'll keep
your meddling ways

00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:02.564
under lock
and key.

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:04.231
(laughing)

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:05.431
Aww...

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.597
(Quattro)
Shark, nap time's over!

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:09.431
Time to get
up and duel!

00:03:09.497 --> 00:03:11.097
Or were you hoping
that if you lie there,

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:13.831
I might show your
pathetic self some pity?

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:16.097
Well you'll get no such
sympathy from me!

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:19.731
Get up and duel, you owe it
to your sister, don't you?

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:24.264
(Number 32)
Shark!

00:03:26.897 --> 00:03:28.564
Shark!

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:30.831
(Shark)
You again.

00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:33.131
It's time, Shark!

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:37.531
Let me enter
your mind and soul.

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:41.564
Let me take hold.

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:43.531
Yeah, right,
no chance.

00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:45.197
I won't join you.

00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:47.664
I will not let
you take hold!

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.431
(Yuma)
Stand up Shark,
please, stand up.

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:54.531
Are you okay?

00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:57.897
I'm...
not sure.

00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:00.137
What's wrong
with him, Yuma?

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:01.637
He is struggling.

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.537
I believe a Number
is trying to take over

00:04:03.604 --> 00:04:05.471
both his mind
and soul.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.671
Oh, man.

00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:11.304
(Number 32)
Accept me and
we will be unstoppable.

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:14.137
Together we shall
defeat your foe!

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:16.371
Do not deny yourself
the revenge

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.904
you have long
desired.

00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:22.471
Allow me to take
hold of you!

00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:24.904
I'll never
join you.

00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:26.804
Never!

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:31.371
You hear me?

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.104
I'll never
join you.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:37.271
Never!

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.413
I draw!

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.246
And activate
the spell

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:50.246
Different Dimension
Deepsea Trench!

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:53.986
This card forces me to
banish Shark Drake!

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.286
What?

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:56.386
He banished it?

00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:58.453
A most impressive
maneuver.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.786
Shark not only
eliminated

00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:01.786
the Number's efforts
to merge with him,

00:05:01.853 --> 00:05:03.486
but by banishing
Shark Drake,

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.119
Quattro's Gimmick
Puppet of Strings'

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:07.253
special ability
does not activate.

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.219
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:14.553
Quattro,
you're up.

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.819
(Quattro)
Not a bad move,
Shark.

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:18.253
Congrats on
buying yourself

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.786
a little more
time to stay afloat.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.619
But eventually
you will be sunk.

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:24.986
Look at the
cold hard facts.

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:26.986
First, my Gimmick
Puppet of Strings

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:29.786
has 3,000
attack points!

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:33.553
Second, it's equipped
with String of Destiny.

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:38.619
And third, your life points
are no match for my own!

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:40.819
Face it, there's no way
you can win this!

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:43.819
(Vetrix)
Your confidence may be your
undoing, Quattro.

00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.853
The equip spell
String of Destiny

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.053
is quite the
risky card to play.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:49.919
So risky, Quattro,

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.719
that if things do not
go the way you plan,

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:55.093
you could ultimately fall
flat on your face like Yuma.

00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:01.559
If the top card you send to your
graveyard is a monster card,

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.693
you can attack
multiple times.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.859
But if it isn't,
you're in trouble.

00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:08.493
You see, you've left your
ability to strike at Shark

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.426
entirely up
to chance now.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:12.626
Well, I believe
luck is on my side.

00:06:12.693 --> 00:06:15.493
Leaving your fate to fortune
is the path of a fool!

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.459
I on the other hand
do not prescribe

00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:20.359
to relying
on luck.

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:22.393
You cling to your
"silly" feelings,

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.793
and employ none of the
strategy of your brothers.

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:26.593
You are simply
raw emotion...

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:27.893
You're wrong!

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.126
See, you
prove my point.

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:33.026
You should be approaching
this duel scientifically.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.459
Strategically.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:37.359
But I'm not even sure you
are capable of doing that.

00:06:37.426 --> 00:06:38.693
You know what?

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.693
I think I know why you've
got a problem with me.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.626
You resent the fact
that I don't grovel

00:06:43.693 --> 00:06:45.593
to you like
my brothers.

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.693
And yes, I may
talk back,

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.359
but I'm no less
loyal to you.

00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:53.433
Vetrix!

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:55.866
You know something,
I miss my father!

00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:57.999
The man named
Byron Arclight!

00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:00.866
He believed in me and
in all my brothers too.

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:02.433
But all he's become

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.033
is a coldhearted,
revenge-obsessed child

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.533
who just gives my brothers
and I orders instead of love.

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:11.733
But Trey, Quinton,
and I all still obeyed you!

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:14.633
I guess it's in memory of
the father you used to be.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.699
That's why I did
everything you've asked

00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:18.233
to stir Shark's anger.

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:21.033
You're pathetic
know that?

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.399
I don't care if Vetrix
was calling the shots!

00:07:23.466 --> 00:07:24.533
You're still paying

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.499
for everything you
did to me, Quattro!

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:28.133
You can try
and collect,

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:30.999
but you're gonna be walkin'
away empty handed!

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:32.733
And once you've
been beat,

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:35.633
I'll see that Dr. Faker
gets his due.

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:37.799
And after I defeat Faker,
maybe then Vetrix

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:41.399
will start believing
in me again, like before.

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:43.966
He just needs to see
I can deliver results.

00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:45.466
Hopefully that'll
be the first step

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.466
in getting my
real father back.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.766
But until he returns,

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:51.466
I have to accept that Vetrix
won't ever believe in me.

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.739
You think you're the only
one I don't have faith in?

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:54.839
Think again.

00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:56.839
Your brothers are
just as useless.

00:07:56.906 --> 00:07:59.106
I'd sooner believe
in three baboons!

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.339
I can rely on you
three for one thing.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.206
To constantly deliver
disappointment.

00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:06.706
The only person I have
faith in is myself.

00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:10.273
Because it was my own cunning
that got me back to this world.

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.406
Poor Quattro.

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:17.039
You may not believe in me,
but that doesn't matter!

00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:18.806
I believe in myself!

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.939
I'm more than just
your pawn, Vetrix.

00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:23.673
I've become a World Famous
Dueling Champion

00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:27.239
and I'm going to show you
exactly why right now!

00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:29.739
It's my turn!

00:08:29.806 --> 00:08:31.039
I draw!

00:08:33.206 --> 00:08:34.673
This next move will
prove to you

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:38.039
that I have both the
luck and skill to win!

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:40.273
By attacking with Gimmick
Puppet of Strings,

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:44.373
my Equip Spell String
of Destiny now activates!

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:49.573
I draw one card from my deck
and send it to the graveyard!

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:50.706
If it's a monster,

00:08:50.773 --> 00:08:52.413
I can attack the
same number of times

00:08:52.479 --> 00:08:55.079
as that
monster's level!

00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:59.413
Now this duel will end
the way it was meant to!

00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:00.679
No!

00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:04.213
It appears that luck was
not on Quattro's side.

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:07.513
But why?

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:12.979
That means Quattro
can't attack!

00:09:13.046 --> 00:09:15.413
Maybe not, but
I have other ideas.

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:18.879
I summon Gimmick Puppet
Scissor Arms from my hand!

00:09:18.946 --> 00:09:20.746
I can double
Scissor Arms' Level

00:09:20.813 --> 00:09:23.279
by destroying
String of Destiny!

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:25.979
It was hurting me more
than helping me anyway.

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:28.779
By doing that,
Scissor Arms

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:30.846
becomes Level 8!

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.213
Curious.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:37.346
It appears Quattro implemented
a very unique strategy.

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:40.113
If he had only summoned Scissor
Arms instead of attacking

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.279
with Gimmick Puppet
of Strings earlier,

00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:45.746
he could have attacked with both
monsters and won this duel.

00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:48.646
Maybe...
he just forgot?

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:53.886
<i>(Vetrix)
I warned Quattro to approach
this strategically!</i>

00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:56.853
<i>But he chose not to listen and
lost the chance to attack.</i>

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:59.653
<i>Serves him right!</i>

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:03.186
I tribute Gimmick
Puppet of Strings!

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:08.153
Now I can bring out
Gimmick Puppet Nightmare!

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:12.686
When I Xyz Summon,
Gimmick Puppet Nightmare

00:10:12.753 --> 00:10:15.819
counts as two monsters
instead of one!

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:17.819
This can't fail!

00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:21.219
I overlay my
Level 8 Scissor Arms

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:23.753
and my two Gimmick
Puppet Nightmares!

00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:30.653
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:32.053
And Xyz Summon!

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:33.986
My real "ace in the hole."

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:38.553
Now arise Number 88.

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:41.770
Gimmick Puppet of Leo!

00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:03.171
(Astral)
Quattro's Gimmick Puppet of Leo
is extremely powerful.

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:06.004
This does not bode
well for Shark.

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.004
I activate
Leo's ability.

00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:13.471
I can remove one Overlay
Unit from Leo each turn.

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:15.804
When it runs out
of them, I win!

00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:17.738
So I don't need to
do anything at all

00:11:17.804 --> 00:11:20.304
but wait for your defeat
in just a few moments.

00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:21.938
His monster's
special ability

00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:24.638
has practically
assured his victory!

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:25.904
Incredible!

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:27.904
What a monster!

00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:29.871
(Quattro)
And now my Gimmick
Puppet of Leo

00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:32.538
only has one
Overlay Unit left,

00:11:32.604 --> 00:11:35.838
so on my next
turn, I win!

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.404
I'm afraid there's nothing
left for you to do now

00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:40.638
but accept
that you, Shark,

00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:42.804
are moments from
losing the duel!

00:11:44.644 --> 00:11:45.711
That can't be.

00:11:45.778 --> 00:11:47.678
Shark can't lose
to this guy.

00:11:47.744 --> 00:11:50.178
(Astral)
His situation is
most precarious.

00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:51.544
Shark must
somehow destroy

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:54.711
Gimmick Puppet of Leo
to avoid defeat.

00:11:54.778 --> 00:11:56.111
<i>(Shark)
This can't be
happening!</i>

00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:58.344
<i>I'm going to lose--
to Quattro?</i>

00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:00.411
<i>I was so close
to getting my revenge!</i>

00:12:00.478 --> 00:12:01.911
<i>Now it's
slipping away!</i>

00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:04.344
<i>I've got to do
something, think!</i>

00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:07.444
<i>(Vetrix)
Hello, Shark.</i>

00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.678
Vetrix.

00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:11.144
You know I happen to see a
way out of this for you!

00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.544
Simply approach this
sticky situation

00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:16.111
the way Quattro never
could, strategically.

00:12:16.178 --> 00:12:18.544
Vetrix, stay
out of this!

00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:21.044
I don't need you helping
Shark find a way to beat me!

00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:23.978
You've already lost,
you're useless to me.

00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:29.978
Your role in my designs has
ended, congratulations.

00:12:30.044 --> 00:12:32.544
You did an
adequate job.

00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:34.044
I'll take it
from here, Quattro.

00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:36.011
I see no further
need for you.

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:38.178
Vetrix.
(Vetrix)
Shark!

00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:42.211
We both know you can't walk
away from this duel a loser!

00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:43.944
Now do what needs
to be done.

00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:45.551
Unless of course
you no longer care

00:12:45.618 --> 00:12:47.951
about getting even
with Quattro.

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:51.151
No, I will have
my revenge.

00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:54.384
Ah, splendid, I'm glad we're
on the same page, then.

00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:57.618
That rage makes you
ideal to do my bidding.

00:12:57.684 --> 00:12:58.918
Quiet!

00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:01.251
I'm not helping you!

00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:04.318
Shark!

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:05.618
(Shark)
What's going on?

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:08.184
It seems that
Number 32: Shark Drake

00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:11.184
wants to get
your attention.

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:15.318
<i>(Vetrix)
You know what you have
to do to win!</i>

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:16.884
<i>Summon Shark Drake.</i>

00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:22.418
Nooooooooooooo!

00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:25.084
(Number 32: Shark Drake)
Shark...

00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:27.318
(Vetrix)
It's calling you.

00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:30.118
Shark Drake
is calling you!

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.918
(maniacal laughing)

00:13:33.884 --> 00:13:36.818
No, no!

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.551
(Vetrix)
Stop fighting!

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:41.051
Defeat Quattro
once and for all.

00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:43.051
<i>No.</i>

00:13:43.118 --> 00:13:45.457
<i>(Vetrix)
Stop pretending there
is another course.</i>

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:47.824
<i>This is your
only option.</i>

00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:51.591
<i>The one way to win is to
let the Number take hold.</i>

00:13:51.657 --> 00:13:54.524
<i>There is no other path to
victory in this duel!</i>

00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:56.757
You want to win
this duel don't you?

00:13:56.824 --> 00:13:59.757
Hurry, before it's too late
and the time has passed.

00:13:59.824 --> 00:14:02.857
Let the Number take hold
and get your revenge!

00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:04.891
I must have
revenge!

00:14:04.957 --> 00:14:07.357
No don't, don't
give in, Shark.

00:14:07.424 --> 00:14:09.624
This duel, this
is my one chance.

00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:10.791
No Shark.

00:14:10.857 --> 00:14:12.991
Fight the Number,
fight it.

00:14:13.057 --> 00:14:15.491
<i>(Shark)
From the moment Quattro
showed up in my life,</i>

00:14:15.557 --> 00:14:17.391
<i>he's been
messing it up!</i>

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:20.824
<i>Ever since then, I've dreamed
of only one thing!</i>

00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:22.491
<i>To get
revenge on him!</i>

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:25.158
<i>If I can finally get that,
nothing else matters!</i>

00:14:27.524 --> 00:14:29.358
I must defeat
Quattro!

00:14:29.424 --> 00:14:31.391
It is the only way
this can end!

00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:34.158
So now I know
what I must do.

00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:37.224
(Number 32: Shark Drake)
Shark...

00:14:42.124 --> 00:14:45.731
My turn, I draw!

00:14:45.798 --> 00:14:47.264
And I think I'll begin
by flipping over

00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:49.464
my Deep Sweeper
in defense mode!

00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:51.764
Then I switch
it to attack mode!

00:14:54.098 --> 00:14:57.531
Now I'll activate Deep
Sweeper's special ability!

00:14:57.598 --> 00:15:00.798
Which means I can tribute
it to destroy a spell,

00:15:00.864 --> 00:15:04.298
so I'm getting rid
of Deepsea Trench!

00:15:04.364 --> 00:15:06.364
Now that Deepsea
Trench is gone,

00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:08.531
Shark Drake
returns to my field!

00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:11.698
Shark Drake
is back?

00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:12.964
Badder than ever.

00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:15.964
This move could have dire
consequences for Shark.

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.098
No way.

00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:27.451
(Shark)
Now the all-powerful Shark
Drake returns to my field!

00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:28.850
Well, it won't be
here for long

00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:32.051
since my Gimmick Puppet of
Leo has more attack points!

00:15:32.117 --> 00:15:35.451
Face it, your Shark Drake's
no match for my Number!

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:38.757
Correction Quattro, it's no
match for your Number yet!

00:15:38.824 --> 00:15:40.624
Say what?
You heard
me right!

00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:43.057
My next move is the
beginning of your end!

00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:45.457
Shark Drake,
the time has come!

00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:48.691
Let us unite so that we
can merge and evolve!

00:15:51.924 --> 00:15:53.124
What's happening?

00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:54.191
Nothing good!

00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:56.924
Go Chaos
Xyz Evolution!

00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:24.257
Appear,
Chaos Number 32!

00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:26.357
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:46.497
Whoa, Shark Drake
became a Chaos Number.

00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:48.097
How is it that
Shark is capable

00:16:48.164 --> 00:16:50.531
of summoning a monster
such as this?

00:16:50.597 --> 00:16:52.097
Very well done, Shark.

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:54.964
I just knew you were
the right choice.

00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:59.097
No, it's a nightmare.

00:16:59.164 --> 00:17:02.797
I activate Shark Drake' Veiss'
special ability!

00:17:02.864 --> 00:17:07.331
I use one Overlay Unit to banish
Aero Shark from my graveyard!

00:17:07.397 --> 00:17:09.131
Now your monster
loses attack points

00:17:09.197 --> 00:17:11.797
equal to Aero Shark's
attack points!

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.097
Your Gimmick Puppet of Leo is
now as harmless as a kitten!

00:17:22.264 --> 00:17:23.631
What?

00:17:23.697 --> 00:17:25.331
And now Shark
Drake Veiss,

00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:27.364
attack his Gimmick
Puppet of Leo!

00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:29.064
Go Chaos Stream!

00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:09.704
Shark did it,
he won.

00:18:09.771 --> 00:18:12.171
Excellent dueling,
well done.

00:18:12.237 --> 00:18:13.337
Vetrix!

00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:15.671
You are truly worthy
of taking down Faker.

00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:16.871
No, you're wrong.

00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:18.704
You're the only one
I'm taking down!

00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:22.171
You'll regret messing
with me, that's a promise.

00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:24.704
Such enthusiasm,
I like that.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.071
But you see you and I are
not meant to duel yet.

00:18:27.137 --> 00:18:28.504
It is not in the cards.

00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:30.337
Face me!

00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:32.204
No, I think not.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.404
Oh no, Shark.

00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:37.144
(Vetrix)
Yuma Tsukumo.

00:18:37.211 --> 00:18:39.144
I'll be keeping
an eye on you

00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:41.644
to see just how far
"feeling the flow"

00:18:41.711 --> 00:18:43.411
can take you in
this tournament.

00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:45.877
(maniacal laughter)

00:18:47.111 --> 00:18:49.244
Where'd he go?

00:18:51.577 --> 00:18:54.111
Shark,

00:18:54.177 --> 00:18:56.111
I'm so sorry,
Shark,

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.177
about everything.

00:18:58.244 --> 00:18:59.244
Yeah, right!

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:00.777
After everything
you pulled?

00:19:00.844 --> 00:19:02.177
You have to
believe me.

00:19:02.244 --> 00:19:04.711
It was all
because of Vetrix!

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:08.577
I never should have followed
his orders, but I did.

00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:10.277
When I dueled
your sister,

00:19:10.344 --> 00:19:13.444
Vetrix forced me
to use a powerful card.

00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:15.444
It caused
a huge fire.

00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:18.911
It was because of that card
that she wound up hurt.

00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:24.077
I felt terribly
about what had happened,

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:26.311
and even rescued her
from the blaze.

00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:28.311
I never meant
to hurt her,

00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:29.977
but that's what
Vetrix planned.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.111
As his son,
I didn't think,

00:19:32.177 --> 00:19:35.844
and just did
what my father asked.

00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:37.284
You have to
believe me.

00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.384
I never wanted
to hurt her, Shark.

00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:40.784
I believe you.

00:19:40.851 --> 00:19:43.384
You're the reason she escaped
the fire in one piece.

00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:46.351
Yes but it--
it's all my fault!

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:49.017
They were my
actions after all.

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:52.317
So if you're going
to hate someone, hate me.

00:19:52.384 --> 00:19:55.051
I deserve it for
what I've done.

00:19:55.117 --> 00:20:00.084
I beg of you, help me Shark,
I need you, I need him.

00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:01.951
Please, Shark.

00:20:02.017 --> 00:20:04.184
Bring my real
father back!

00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:05.984
Quattro!

00:20:06.051 --> 00:20:08.451
When you do,
tell him this.

00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:11.751
We'll be waiting,
all of my brothers and I

00:20:11.817 --> 00:20:14.817
for him to rejoin
us as a family,

00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:16.751
just like before.

00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:19.017
Quattro!

00:20:23.617 --> 00:20:25.617
Shark,

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.517
wait, Shark.

00:20:27.584 --> 00:20:29.851
Did you hear what
Quattro said?

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:32.784
So, are you gonna help us
take down Vetrix or not?

00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:33.884
Are you listening?

00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:35.984
Yeah, now you
listen, Yuma.

00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:38.657
I'm going after Vetrix
regardless of Quattro,

00:20:38.724 --> 00:20:40.291
'cause that creep
needs to learn

00:20:40.357 --> 00:20:42.524
never, ever
mess with me.

00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:44.457
But Shark...

00:20:49.757 --> 00:20:52.457
I see that Shark wants
to duel for the wrong reason!

00:20:52.524 --> 00:20:54.891
I just wish I could talk
some sense into him.

00:20:54.957 --> 00:20:57.457
Dueling's not
about revenge.

00:20:57.524 --> 00:20:59.391
Yuma, perhaps
your actions

00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:02.057
will speak louder than
your words will?

00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:03.557
If you follow
your instincts,

00:21:03.624 --> 00:21:05.724
then others will
follow your lead.

00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:10.891
(Yuma)
You're right, and I know
I'm on the right path!

00:21:10.957 --> 00:21:14.567
So watch out, 'cause
there's no stopping me!
