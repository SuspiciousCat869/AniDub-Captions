Why did you have to bring me
back in this form?

The only reason
I brought you back at all

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.168

If your information
is correct,

If we travel

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.748
there are seven Numbers
hidden there!

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.515
Seven Numbers?

also an important message.

the situation is much worse

Inside of each is one of
the seven Mythyrian Numbers.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.274
These cards are unlike any you
have ever seen

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.076
and if they
fall into Barian hands,

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.745
an ancient evil will destroy
everything you

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:13.546
have been fighting for!

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:17.717

Numbers before the Barians can.

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.214
And then I place
two more cards facedown,

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.749
ending my turn!

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.519
Which makes it
my move!

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:10.323
Remember, this is
no ordinary opponent.

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:11.157
That's for sure.

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:13.559
There is a price
to be paid for failure.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.729
If you do not pass your test,
the Number will remain here,

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:21.067
along with two of
your companions' souls!

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:22.735
What do you mean?

(gasping)

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:30.643
Shark and Nash!

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:31.310
Where are they?

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.746
It looks like
they're in trouble!

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.182
(rumbling)

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:41.020
We definitely
walked into a trap!

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.755
And unless we think of
something fast,

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:44.624
we're not
walking out of here!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.092
Reginald!

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.260
Hey, keep them
out of this!

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.261
Let them go free!

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:52.531
Only by surrendering,
can you lead your companions

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.734
to freedom and find victory.

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:56.102
(Astral)
Victory through surrender?

00:18:56.102 --> 00:19:00.239
If we do not solve this riddle,
I fear our quest could be over

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.108
before it has begun.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:03.209
Me surrender?

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:03.743
Never!

00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:05.645
I'll fight full-out 'til
I get that Number

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.746
and save Shark and Nash!

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:09.248
I'm gonna get things
rolling by summoning

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:12.218
Gagaga Magician!

00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:15.554
And whenever I have a Gagaga
monster on my field,

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.757
I can also summon
this little fella!

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:21.394
Its special ability instantly
activates, which means I can

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:23.095
change this
little guy's Level

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.764
to match Gagaga Magician's!

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:29.468
So the kid gets a boost
so it's at Level 4 as well!

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.740
All right, then, now that
I have two Level 4 monsters...

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.741
Yuma!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:36.676
You were gonna remind me

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.144
that if I use them
to summon Utopia,

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:39.745
it won't be able
to attack this turn.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:43.182
But I'm way ahead of you,
which is why I'm activating

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.483
Gagaga Tag!

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.985
This spell ups
the attack points

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:49.055
of both my Gagaga monsters
by 500!

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:51.323
Yuma will now attack with his
Gagaga monsters

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:54.427
so that he may summon
Utopia at the end of his turn.

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:56.696
It is a sensible move
and yet...

00:19:56.696 --> 00:20:00.466
I fear this guardian
will not yield so easily.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.134
(rumbling)

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:04.570
Hang on!

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.006
I promise, I'm gonna get you
outta there

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:09.141
no matter what it takes!
