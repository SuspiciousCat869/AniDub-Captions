00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.130
I heard you beat shark
the other day.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.030
Well, then you heard the truth.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.760
I don't believe you.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.530
Everyone knows shark is
the best duelist around.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.560
Believe it Caswell,
'cause it's True.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.790
We were right there.
We saw it happen.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.560
Then according to the laws of
the transitive property...

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.060
transi-Whatty?

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.660
Beating you would mean
that in the end,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.830
I am the best duelist in school.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.590
I'm not sure I buy
that logic, Caswell.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.330
Either way, that's
not gonna happen,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.030
'cause I've got an awesome
number car eh?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.830
Where'D my number card go?
I had it this morning!

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.190
What's the matter?

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.130
Are you feeling the
pressure already?

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.530
Wait a second, just hang on,

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.060
I'm not ready!

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.490
I summon crashbug x!

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.130
Crashbug!

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.190
Now zap his life points!

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.030
[Screams]

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.590
what happened?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.230
That was embarrassing.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.660
You can say that again.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.860
Ha! I bested you in one move!

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.590
You never had a chance.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.460
In the end, there was no way an
intellectually challenged

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.360
amateur like you could defeat
a brilliant strategist

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.060
such as myself.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.460
What did you call me?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.460
There's no need to
boast, Caswell.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.530
Dueling is actually a
lot like life.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.730
Sometimes things go
as we planned.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.290
Other times, we make mistakes
and we get frustrated.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.090
When that happens,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.860
you just have to feed your
frustrations to crashbug.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.130
You guys know the legend
behind crashbug, right?

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.590
Crashbug's this little
electrical spirit, and he likes

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.030
to zap what he calls bugs.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.460
Bugs are those feelings
that get in our way.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.330
Frustration, doubt... Give those
bugs to crashbug and you can

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.590
move past them and succeed.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.430
That's ridiculous, Mr. Kay.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.330
Crashbug doesn't actually exist.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.190
Of course it exists.
I've seen it.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.160
So what if you lost, yuma?

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.760
The trick is to not let the
frustration get to you.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.260
Learn from your mistakes
and keep moving forward.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.160
Keep challenging yourself.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.830
You got it, Mr. Kay!
I'm gonna keep at it!

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.690
That's what feeling
the flow is all about.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.560
[laughter]

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.230
isn't Mr. Kay the coolest?

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.060
Not only is he the awesom-Est
smartest math whiz I ever met,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.760
but he's super nice, too!

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:54.090
I wanna be just like
him when I grow up.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.230
Hey doofus, what's up?

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.790
What do you want, sis?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.290
Hop in the car.
Let's go for a drive.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.860
It's a good thing yesterday's
virus attack only spread to a

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.760
few remote servers.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.960
Why? What woulda happened
if it had spread to more...

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.260
remote control...
serving thingies?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.030
The entire city would've
been thrown into chaos.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.760
Whoa, that sounds
really serious.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.860
Forget about traffic
lights and litter bots.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.190
Bank data would've vanished,
people would've lost their

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.660
money, hospitals would've
lost medical records,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.690
and the ability to help people.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.530
It would've been a disaster!

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.060
Wow, are you serious?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.760
Who would do such
a terrible thing?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.230
I have no idea, but I do know
that the virus was transmitted

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.460
from your school library.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.760
What?

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.430
So here's what we're gonna do:

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.290
I'm gonna Chase
a few more leads.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.830
Meanwhile, you two are
gonna stakeout the library.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.890
A stakeout sounds so exciting.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.130
Why did I get hungry
when you said that?

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.930
You're always hungry.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.930
But don't let your
appetite distract you.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.130
I wanna track this Hacker
down, and make him pay

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.630
for deleting my big scoop!

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.490
So what was your
sister's big scoop?

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.790
Ice cream.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.630
-I'm serious.
-So am I.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.060
She discovered that the local
ice cream parlor is a front

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.260
for a criminal organization.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.990
Yuma, we're supposed to
keep our eyes open.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.190
There's nothing to see.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.560
It's almost time for
the library to close.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.330
Maybe the sinister bad
guy took the day off.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.860
Or maybe it's a Hacker holiday
or something, or like...hmm?

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.760
Yuma, shhh! Look!

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.730
-Isn't that...
-Caswell.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.460
Yeah and he's acting
suspicious...

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.230
Hey, what are you doing?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:41.560
That looks like... some
kinda flash drive.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.960
[gasps]

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.230
I didn't mean to
launch anything!

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.930
Caught red-Handed!

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.830
Now tell us why you did it,
you criminal lowlife!

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.060
Unhand me. I'm not
behind this, I'm being used.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.630
Don't try to lie!

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.460
I saw you upload
the virus and...

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.060
um...what are you doing?

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.730
I'm tracking the source
of the rootkit.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.260
If I can pinpoint the location
this machine was just accessed

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.890
from, then we'll know where
the criminal is and.... unnnh!

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.330
This is not good!

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.390
Look, in the end, I found an
encrypted data packet that led

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.960
me to believe I could access a
file on this computer to learn

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.130
who the criminal is, but it
turns out the file was a

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.160
detonator for some sort of
computer virus and now it's...

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.890
Wait, I'm on to something!

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.030
There's our location!

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.690
Your friend triggered
a countdown?

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.330
We sent you the access stuff,
try to stop it!

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.090
We're on our way to the
bad guy's secret Lair.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.990
But it could be dangerous!

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.490
Don't worry sis,
I'll be fine! I think.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.790
That tower under construction.
The Hacker should be in there!

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.690
Maybe you were wrong about
this place, Caswell?

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.030
In the end, have I
ever been wrong?

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.730
You finally put the
pieces together!

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.160
It took you a lot longer
than I thought it would.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.030
Mr. Kay?

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.490
What are you doing
hangin' out here?

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.060
Don't you get it?
In the end, Mr. Kay

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.760
is the criminal mastermind
behind the malicious virus!

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.130
That's one way of putting it.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.160
But, but I was saying earlier
how awesome you are, Mr. Kay.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.190
I think I even said I wanted to
be like you when I grow up.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.660
Hmmph. Someone like you
could never be like me.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.890
I have to say sir,
this is disappointing.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.530
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint you, Caswell.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.090
Especially since I'm so proud of
you for following my clues.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:38.090
I wanted you all to be here when
the virus went Well, viral.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.330
Are you saying you
led us here on purpose?

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.660
[eerie laughter]

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.260
a number!

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.330
observation #4:
this world, like yuma,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.130
is a complex machine.
but not as annoying.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.690
it is complicated in
design. Like a puzzle.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.960
what is that?
it feels like a number.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.760
You cannot stop me.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.490
I can't believe it.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.160
That human bears the
mark of a number.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.490
Aaah! I thought you went
back to saturn or something!

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.030
You were incorrect.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.590
So then where have you been?

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.460
Where did you come
from just now? What are you?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.430
Whatever you are,
don't pop out like that again...

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.290
Uhh... Why is he talking
to himself like that?

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.990
Oh right. Yuma's
invisible duelist friend

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.660
must have appeared
to help him out.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.830
Nevermind, forget it.
I'm gonna ignore you.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.690
What's going on, Mr. Kay?
Why are you doing this?

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.930
This is my personal
challenge to myself.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.660
Like you, always trying
to "feel the flow."

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.330
That's not the same thing!

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.730
Feeling the flow isn't about

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.490
causing trouble
and hurting people!

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.260
Yuma, you must duel this man.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.790
One of the numbers has
consumed his spirit.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:51.230
The only way to reason with him,
is to break the number's hold.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.260
I challenge you to a duel!

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.790
And if you lose, then you have

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.890
to stop the virus
from going off!

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.260
You want to duel me?

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.960
Well I am more than happy to
agree to your conditions, yuma!

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.890
But why do you you think
you can defeat me? Well?

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.360
Because now I'm
feeling the flow!

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.230
Let's do this!
Duel Disk, go!

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.290
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:19.030
Duel interface set.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.360
Augmented reality
Vision Link established.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.130
Let's duel!

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.390
-I know you can win, yuma!
-Yuma has to win!

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.290
Or else Everyone'll think I'm
some kinda criminal.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.930
I believe the first
move is mine. I draw!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.790
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.390
Aw great, a facedown...

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.890
now I don't even know
what I'm up against.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.390
So then try to attack
me and find out.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.060
I think I will.
I summon gagaga magician!

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.630
Wait, since I don't
know what that is,

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.460
maybe I shouldn't attack...

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.990
ah whatever, there's
no point in thinking!

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.960
Gagaga magician,
attack Mr. Kay!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.190
Not a chance.
Crashbug x, show yourself.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.190
Crashbug!

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.090
Oh man, I just got schooled.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.330
How come yuma lost life points
if his monster is just fine?

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.030
If you attack a monster in
defense mode, the attacking

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.760
monster isn't destroyed,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.760
even if the defending monster
has higher defense points.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.190
Thus in the end, if you subtract
the attack points from the

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.360
defense points, yuma
takes 500 points of damage.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.390
It's my turn now, I draw!

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:47.360
-First, I summon crashbug y!
-Crashbug!

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.330
And with that done, I activate
the crashbug road Spell card

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.960
from my hand! Now, we each
choose a level 4-Or-Below

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.360
monster on our fields.
Then, we each summon a monster

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.090
from our hands that has the same
level as the monster we chose.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.160
-I choose crashbug z!
-Bug!

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.890
Okay. The only monster on my
field is gagaga magician.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.260
So that means... sweet!

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.530
I can summon gogogo golem!

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.360
I would highly advise summoning
that golem in defense mode,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.360
since it has an
ability that prevents

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.460
it from being
destroyed in battle.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.530
If I wanted advice from
an annoying ghost,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.730
I'd go to a
haunted house!

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:33.290
I summon gogogo
golem in attack mode!

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.830
How do ya' like that?

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.260
With 1800 attack points, this
golem won't be goin' down easy.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.130
I'm afraid This is what we call
a teachable moment, yuma.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.590
Huh?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.530
You've set me up for
a perfect victory!

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:56.160
It's over, yuma.
I overlay crashbug x, y and z.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.860
With these three monsters, I
build the overlay network!

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.260
here Comes the number.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.130
Ah... an xyz summoning
with three monsters.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.730
That's right!

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.160
Prepare to meet your defeat.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.930
Here comes number 34!

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.990
Terror-Byte!

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.190
It appears to be some sort of
data chip capable of taking the

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.390
form of a member of the
rhinocerotidae family.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.790
But what's the
significance of the number?

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.560
I dunno, it...oh...
ahhh... alright!

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.590
Both of my number cards are
suddenly back in my deck.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.090
weird... is it because
astral came back?

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.160
I'm activating terror-
Byte's special ability!

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.060
Like a denominator absorbs a
numerator in a perfect

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.430
fractional ratio, by
using one overlay unit,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:05.790
I can take control
of one of your monsters!

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.230
Your gogogo golem is mine!

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.390
Aw, not cool Mr. Kay!

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.060
And now, gogogo golem,
attack yuma!

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.790
No, gagaga!

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.430
Sweet, I've broken through
the viral program's firewall.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.630
Now where's the
deactivation code?

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.060
So I've gotta make my way
through This dungeon Maze.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.730
And the clock is still ticking.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.390
You'll never defeat me, yuma.
Your dueling is too imperfect.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.990
My dad used to say
that imperfection

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.790
is what makes us
awesome.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.560
Perfection is everything.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.660
I teach math because it is the
pursuit of absolute perfection.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.860
The only reason your
father said that is

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.690
so you wouldn't feel bad
about being a failure.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.660
Oh man, Mr. Kay is
really laying it out there.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.160
Kinda stings.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.890
Tell me where it stings.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.790
It stings in my heart!

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.760
Observation NUMBER 5: Words
can hurt a human's heart.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.690
I will remember that.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.230
I can't let what
he's saying get to me.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.090
I gotta try to
be strong.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.330
Um... yuma?

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.090
You know how I'm always
saying "in the end?"

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.860
well it's interesting, because
the phrase "in the end"

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.160
is actually about
starting conditions.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.360
Something that is so
"in the end", was that way

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.690
from the beginning.
It was inevitable,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.230
-Sheesh...
-...and so it actually...

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.590
I'm kinda busy at
the moment, Caswell.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.190
Why are you bringing
this up now?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.330
Caswell is simply trying to
explain that in the end,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.630
you're going to lose this duel
and I'm going to infect the

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.130
entire city's control system!

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.060
And that's been the case
since the very beginning!
