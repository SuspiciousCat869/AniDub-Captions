00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:01.190
Cheers, Yuma!

00:00:01.223 --> 00:00:02.656
You're the cat's meow!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.956
He's a great
duelist, too!

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.823
And semi-finalist!

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:08.356
We're sure you're gonna be
the Carnival champion!

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.790
I'm not sure.

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:12.290
(all)
Yay, Yuma!

00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:13.656
(Bronk)
You're A-OJ
with us!

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.690
Thanks guys!

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.856
You're my favorite fans!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.656
He's a dueling dynamo!

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.890
(Cathy)
And the cutest
competitor, too!

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:22.290
What's the matter, Tori?

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:24.223
Don't feel like
celebrating?

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:27.390
I bet Tori's still
ticked off at you!

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:30.156
She'll never forgive you for
deserting her in that desert,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.023
even though she probably
deserved it.

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:34.390
Cathy!Meow!

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:37.356
I'm sorry I forgot ya, but I was
focused on important stuff--

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.190
So I'm not
important, huh!?

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:40.356
(Lillybot)
Eat this Yuma.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.390
It will keep you quiet
and out of trouble.

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:44.356
Of course if you kids
aren't hungry,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.956
you can
always eat later.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.656
No, we'll eat now,
Grandma.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.656
(Bronk)
Yowzah!

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.123
This looks
scrummalicious!

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:51.123
(Caswell)
As usual!

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:52.123
Dig in!

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.190
I don't want
any leftovers!

00:00:54.223 --> 00:00:55.690
Yes, ma'am!

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:56.990
Oh, boy!

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.390
Hey, wait!

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:03.890
But... you told us
to dig in...

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.256
After we give thanks for
our food, of course.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.723
Let's hear it for Grandma!

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.390
(all)
Thanks for
this fabulous feast!

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:10.923
Eat up, Yuma!

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:13.756
You'll need all the energy you
can get for your next duel!

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.990
You'll be facing Shark
or Kite or Vetrix.

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:21.356
They'll have as much chance
against me as this meatball!

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.290
Yuma's really feelin'
the flow!

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.356
Yeah, but he barely won
some of his duels before.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.756
I didn't wanna make it
look too easy!

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.290
(Astral)
Whoever Yuma's opponent is,
this next duel

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:35.156
will surely be
his most challenging ever.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.390
Whether he faces Vetrix with
his crest and Numbers...

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:42.356
or Kite and his
powerful NEO GALAXY-EYES...

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.090
Or perhaps Shark...
who, in the end,

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.656
may be prove to be
the most dangerous of them all

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.956
because of his Chaos Number.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.856
I wonder how he acquired it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.823
I'll polish off anybody
who stands in my way!

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.990
I can't wait to pull out my deck
and start dueling again!

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:05.156
No matter who he faces, Yuma
will need to keep his cool...

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.356
Hey, where's my deck?

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.923
I know I had it on me
but now it's gone!

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.690

How could you lose
your deck?

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.190
You're so
irresponsible.

00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:22.590
(Yuma)
It's not my fault!

00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:25.423
Some card thief must've
picked my pocket!

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:27.590
Well, you think
you can track it down?

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:28.756
Yup!

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.990
Fortunately, the locator chip
in Yuma's deck case

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:32.390
is functioning properly.

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:34.490
According to the tracking app
on my Duel Tab,

00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:37.090
Yuma's deck is in
the middle of Heartland City.

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:40.890
(Bronk)
Only one small problem--
Er, make that not so small.

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:43.756
Since I'm a finalist,
I have VIP access.

Hey, open up, it's me,
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.956
C'mon guys,
I'm really desperate!

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.823
Don't embarrass me in front

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.990
All right, that's it!

There must be a secret password

We've had enough of your
plans for one day, thank you!

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:57.790
Can't you see it's impossible
to get into Heartland?

00:04:57.823 --> 00:05:00.623
Impossible unless you're
driving a truck, that is...

00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:01.756
Oh, yeah.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.723
Those garbage trucks
take the Litterbots

00:05:03.756 --> 00:05:07.690
and the trash they collected to
the recycle center each night.

00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:08.990
I got an idea!

00:05:09.023 --> 00:05:11.490
And it totally stinks!

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:14.356
(Tori)
There's no way I'm getting
inside one of those!

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.090
(Flip)
But it's the only chance!

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:19.223
These garbage cans will get
trucked into Heartland tonight!

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:21.323
All you gotta do is
hitch a ride!

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:22.856
Flip, you're a genius!

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.290
Thanks and good luck!

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:25.290
Ciao!

Where you goin', Flip?

00:05:26.523 --> 00:05:29.156
I gotta go feed
my alligator!

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.723
Hey, get back here!

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:32.123
You little sneak!

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:33.856
Oh well.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.323
Let's get hiding!

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:36.890
But, Yuma!

00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:37.890
Wow.

00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:41.056
He's really going
through with it!

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.823
We can't let
him go alone.

00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:44.290
You go too,
Bronk.

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:46.956
Me-- Jump in a
stinky trash can?

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.056
It's gross... but no worse
than your gym locker.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.123
Gee, thanks.

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:52.590
Now, hold on!

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:54.390
There's still one
free can.

00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:56.890
And you can't
call it, Tori!

00:05:56.923 --> 00:06:00.223
Trust me, I have no intention of
climbing into that can, Cathy.

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.723
Oh, sure you say
you're not going with Yuma...

00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:04.523
but you always end up
with him,

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:08.656
even though I'd
be much more helpful.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.323
Now, girls, I would be more than
happy to give up my place...

00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:14.523

Simply put, although
Hart seems unconscious,

his mind is actually
quite active.

00:17:06.877 --> 00:17:09.344
If we could free Hart
from his present state,

If I collect all the Numbers,
Hart may never be saved.

But if he is saved, Hart
will destroy Astral world...

during our time together.

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.144
And the most
important thing of all

00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:59.711
is that I can trust
your judgment.

00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:03.244

I will accept it.

a lot to me.

But that really didn't
help me at all!

It would be a lot better
if you told me what to do!

00:18:14.477 --> 00:18:16.111
Just tell me that
I should get the Numbers

00:18:16.144 --> 00:18:17.811
for you and your mission!

00:18:17.844 --> 00:18:21.711
If you do that, then I won't
be forced to choose at all!

00:18:21.744 --> 00:18:24.711
I don't understand why you're
leaving all this up to me.

00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:32.611
<i>Welcome to
my domain, Yuma Tsukumo!</i>

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:37.144
<i>I am the notorious genius,
Dr. Faker!</i>

00:18:41.462 --> 00:18:45.429
<i>I am the notorious genius,
Dr. Faker!</i>

00:18:45.462 --> 00:18:47.062
You're Dr. Faker?

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:48.362
I've heard
of you.

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:49.662
You're Kite
and Hart's father.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.129
<i>That's right.</i>

00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:54.795
<i>What a pleasure to meet
the son of Kazuma Tsukumo...</i>

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:59.295
<i>and your associate,
the original Number!</i>

00:18:59.329 --> 00:19:02.062
Astral, if he knows
you're here...

00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:04.295
... then clearly
he can see me.

00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:06.095
So, tell me, Doctor...

00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:08.662
Why are you trying
to collect Numbers?

00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:11.795
I need them to restore
my memory!

00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:13.829
<i>It was all part of
the agreement that I made</i>

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.762
<i>with Barian World.</i>

00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:18.062
What do you know
of Barian?

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:21.362
<i>I know that it is a distant
world that is quite hostile</i>

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:24.295
<i>to your own Astral world.</i>

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.462
<i>I agreed to destroy
Astral world for the Barians.</i>

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:30.929
<i>In exchange I will receive
unimaginable power...</i>

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:34.062
<i>Then I can conquer
the Earth and rule over it!</i>

00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:35.095
That's sick!

00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:37.029
You forced Kite to become
a Number Hunter

00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:40.162
just so you
could get power?

00:19:40.195 --> 00:19:43.295
Kite and Hart are both suffering
because of you!

00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:45.895
How could you treat
your own kids this way?

00:19:45.929 --> 00:19:47.529
<i>Their fate was necessary.</i>

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:48.929
Necessary?

00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:51.229
<i>My son's well-being means
nothing when compared</i>

00:19:51.262 --> 00:19:53.429
<i>to the power
within my grasp!</i>

00:19:53.462 --> 00:19:56.762
<i>I'll willingly sell out anyone
to gain such power...</i>

00:19:56.795 --> 00:20:00.795
<i>like I did with
your own father, Kazuma!</i>

00:20:00.829 --> 00:20:03.562
<i>A true genius like me cannot
allow lesser creatures</i>

00:20:03.595 --> 00:20:05.662
<i>to stand in my way.</i>

00:20:05.695 --> 00:20:07.662
You're still gonna
have to get past me.

00:20:07.695 --> 00:20:09.362
<i>That will be easy.</i>

00:20:09.395 --> 00:20:11.729
<i>You're destined
for destruction, Yuma...</i>

00:20:11.762 --> 00:20:15.295
<i>the same way Astral world
is doomed!</i>

00:20:15.329 --> 00:20:16.795
<i>Thanks for dropping in...</i>

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:18.629
<i>Now drop out!</i>

00:20:26.795 --> 00:20:30.429
At least we sort of
made a soft landing...

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.795
Whoa, my deck!

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:34.229
Should of worn a helmet...

00:20:34.262 --> 00:20:39.195
Yuma, next time you lose your
deck go find it on your own!

00:20:39.229 --> 00:20:40.995
Doctor Faker...

00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:45.962
<i>(Mr. Heartland)
It's gonna be a dynamic
day duel, devotees,</i>

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.862
<i>as we prepare
to launch the thrilling</i>

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:50.262
<i>World Duel Carnival
semi-finals!</i>

00:20:50.295 --> 00:20:51.962
<i>We're down
to our final four!</i>

00:20:51.995 --> 00:20:54.462
<i>The survivors of the Duel
Coaster will now face off</i>

00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:57.995
<i>to see who becomes the first
World Duel Carnival champ!</i>

00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:01.329
This stadium's about to get
hotter than a barbeque grill

00:21:01.362 --> 00:21:04.062
as Vetrix goes toe-to-toe
against Kite

00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:07.095
and Shark aims
his sights on Yuma!

00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:11.029
(cheering)

00:21:12.228 --> 00:21:13.628
I can do this,
Astral.

00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.295
I'll find a way
to take the top prize

00:21:15.328 --> 00:21:17.629
and at the same time, help you
and all the friends

00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:18.962
who're counting on me!

00:21:18.995 --> 00:21:19.928
Yes!

00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:23.195
C'mon--
Let's high-five the sky!
