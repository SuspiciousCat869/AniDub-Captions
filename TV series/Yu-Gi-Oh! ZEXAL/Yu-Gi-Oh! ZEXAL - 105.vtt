00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.608
I am sensing something.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:11.311
As if the Numbers
want me to listen?

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.179
That is it!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.947
The Numbers we acquired
at the ruins

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.717
are trying to tell me two tales.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.957
The first tells of a valiant
knight who fell in battle.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:24.925
The winged horse Pegasus

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.527
sped to its master's rescue,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.695
and the two parted from this
earthly realm,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.865
their bond cemented
for all eternity.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.867
The second tells
of a great warrior

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.736
who would battle only
with his hands.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.838
Afraid of the warrior
becoming too powerful,

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:41.775
he was labeled a traitor
and banished from his homeland.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.778
These legends...

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.881

were human?

Alito, what happened?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.583
You changed.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.319
You're a completely different
person now.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.488
A scary person...

Snap out of it!

Me?

Who else?

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:09.730
Let me guess,
you were thinking about

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.933
that Barian, Alito, again,
right, Yuma?

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:13.533
Well, yeah!

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.936
It 's like he' s totally changed.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.870
Don't be so sure.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.774
Maybe you just saw his true
colors for the first time.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:21.842
True colors?

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:24.945
We are beginning our
descent at Point G 107,

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.881
the location of the fourth
Mythyrian Number.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.184
I wonder what this
next ruin will be like.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:31.652
Me too.

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.520
Hey, do you think
we might learn of another

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.288
legend when we find it?

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.557
If so, I hope it's
about rainbows

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:38.191
and puppies this time,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.361
'cause all the others have
been such downers.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.834

Galaxy-Eyes
is calling to me.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:52.105
Could a duel soon be in
the cards for us?

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.349
(thundering)

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.818
(Dumon)
This is quite unsettling.

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:08.055
The legend I discovered at
the underground temple...

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.924
I already knew the story
inscribed on the walls,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:15.128
but how could that be since it
was the first time I went there?

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.697
(Mizar)
Dumon.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:20.300
I take it you acquired
the Mythyrian Number?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.701
No.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.237
Unfortunately it was taken
by Astral and Yuma.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.039
What?!

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.140
What happened, Dumon?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.775
Did you meet with some trouble?

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.512
My hunt for the Number led me
through a maze of traps.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:35.515
I am lucky to
have escaped at all!

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.384
But before I got away

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.653
I found a legend
written in stone.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:43.623
When I read it, I felt
something inside me awaken...

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.926
like a hidden memory.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:47.761
A hidden memory?

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.763
Mizar, I have been thinking.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.698
There are seven
Mythyrian Numbers

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.067
and we are seven emperors.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.836
Is this simply coincidence?

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:59.072
Dumon, are you implying
that there is a link between

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:03.243
the legends of these foolish
humans and we Barians?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.679
In any case,
I will double our efforts

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.314
to gather the Mythyrian Numbers

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:10.283

collect any more!

I bet the Number is at
the top of that mountain!

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.906
So that means we're
gonna have to climb

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.074

Oh no, you won't!

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.924
I'm no fan of rock climbing.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.092
I'll stay with you.
Yeah?

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:26.526
Of course!

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:29.996
It's more fun to be alone

you'll be careful!

But your dad was a pro.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.150
He could climb mountains.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.452
You have a hard time
climbing stairs.

You're beginning to

You can count on it!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.899
(Yuma)
The trick to climbing mountains
is to get a foothold first,

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.067
then stretch your arm out

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:09.169
and hoist yourself up,
like this!

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.139
Also, it's important to
keep an eye out for each other.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.108
Climbing is a team sport.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:15.909
Why climb at all?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.845
You've got enough hot air
to float up, Yuma!

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:22.582

What was that?

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:28.955
A roar.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.991

Don't worry, I gotcha, Kite.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:51.144
Like I told Shark,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:54.981
it pays to watch each other's
backs up here.

an enormous mountain...

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.720
But who'd be
waiting for us up here?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.522
I've got a hunch, but trust me
you won't like it.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.691
I think the Barians are here!

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.426
Be ready!

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.163
♪♪

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:18.898
I smell something.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.868
Yuma?
Yeah... right over here.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.603
You think it's a Barian?

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:27.307
It smells too yummy
to be a Barian.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.483
Bet it tastes
as good as it smells.

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.985
(Jinlon)
Don't count on finding out!

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.326
Stay away from my lunch!

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:48.528
Hey, watch it, that hurt!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.530
What do you think
you 're doin', mister?!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.699
Funny... that is what
I should be asking!

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.469
How dare you try to eat my
stewed pigs' feet!

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.004
No, I was just looking.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:02.175
Yes, looking like a foolish
raccoon thieving by day!

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.010
You've got me all wrong!

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.345
You're lying!

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:06.212
I am not lying!

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:09.482
Now you're lying about
all the lying you've done!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.252
Who are you?

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:13.353
More liars?

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.621
Excuse our moronic friend.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:17.557
We've come to these
ruins to find a Number.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.427
A Number?

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.736

yourself with a dragon.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:30.537
That's right.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:32.105
And I have a strong feeling that

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.908
I'm not the only one, am I?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.411

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.814

Just who are you, old man?

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.552
My name is Jinlon,

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:49.722
the guardian of the Number
here at Temple Draghos.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.826
To make this climb shows spirit.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:53.626
(chuckling)

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.494
You remind me of someone

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:57.497
that I once knew
long ago, young one.

00:09:57.497 --> 00:09:57.831
Who?

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:01.434
A brave duelist who dared face
the fiercest of dragons.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.035
Their savage battle

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:06.039
has gone on to become the stuff
of legend at these ruins.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:09.542
That duelist he knew was Mizar.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:10.643
Say what?

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:11.111
I see.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.913
So you are familiar with
the legend of Temple Draghos

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.381
as well, stranger?

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.150
Hold on!
How can that be?

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.718
Mizar's a Barian!

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.353
He's not from this world!

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:20.987
Perhaps not, Yuma.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:23.957
But this is what the Numbers
we retrieved from the ruins

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.592
have told me.

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.560
I learned that the seven
Mythyrian Numbers

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.131
each tell a story of one
of the Barian emperors...

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.902
when they were still human,
many centuries ago.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.239
No way, the Barians were humans?

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:40.740
Why didn't you tell us?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.509
Apologies, Shark.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.942
Whoa!

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.678
That means... the legends
at the ruins we've found

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.615
so far have been
all about the Barians!

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:50.817
(Kite)
Yuma, Shark.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.521
I'll be the one to handle
this duel, got it?

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:55.054
How come, Kite?

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:59.192
Because I don't think it's just
a coincidence that I'm here.

00:10:59.192 --> 00:10:59.792
It's fate.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:02.529
My dragon and I were destined
to face Jinlon

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.164
and duel his beast.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:04.898
Very well.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:07.400
If you are able to defeat me
and my fearsome dragon,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.703
I will hand over this
ruins' Number as your trophy.

But if you lose, I take
your dragon instead.

Is that understood?

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:15.575
Suit yourself.

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:18.711
Just know that there's
no way that you'll win.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:19.646
You are like a peacock,

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.848
little more than a bold veneer.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:25.151

Was it your dragon Mizar had
to battle against, Jinlon?

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.711
If so, did you beat Mizar
in this legendary duel?

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.447
Maybe if you win,
I will tell you.

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.582
Let us begin!

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:56.482
I draw!

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.785
I summon Mythic Tree Dragon!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:03.823
(chuckling)

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.426
And since I have Mythic
Tree Dragon on my field,

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:07.560
you're about to get all wet,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.296
because I'm allowed to
summon this!

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:12.398
Mythic Water Dragon!

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.505
Next I activate Mythic Tree
Dragon's special ability!

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.908
When there is
a Water Monster on my field,

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.177
I can double Mythic Tree
Dragon's Level.

00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:29.249
Jinlon's already got two
Level 8 monsters on his field.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.252
And the best is yet to come!

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.321
I overlay my Level 8
Mythic Tree Dragon

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.257
and Mythic Water Dragon!

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:40.293
With these two monsters,

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:44.397
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon...

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:49.202
Number 46: Dragluon!

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.515
(roaring)

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:08.888
Look at that!

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.823
This must be the ruins' Number.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.726
I'll have your Number
beat in no time!

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:14.360
I think not.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.396
This is the mightiest
of all dragons!

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.797
Oh really?
I'll be the judge.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.199
Let's see
what it can do.
As you wish.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.136
I activate Dragluon's
special ability!

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.438
When I have no
other dragons on my field,

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:26.039
other than this one,

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:29.142
I can use one Overlay Unit
to summon another dragon

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:29.876
from my hand!

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.345
Luckily, I know
just the monster to choose

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:34.447
and I cannot wait to show you.

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:37.383
Arise Armed Protector Dragon!

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.519
(roaring)

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:43.656
What?

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.524
His Number's vanished!

00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:47.093
Hey, where did Dragluon go?

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:47.860
(chuckling)

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.963
It is like a chameleon
hiding in plain sight.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.565
When I have a Dragon
on my field,

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.167
my Dragluon's special ability

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.435
stops you from attacking it

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:57.804
or using any effects to
do it damage!

00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:00.573
In other words, as long as
Armed Protector Dragon

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.509
is around,
you can't harm my Number!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.012
So I'll make sure
Armed Protector Dragon

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.415
stays safe by guarding it
with Dragon Shield!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.451
This superior shield

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:14.253
blocks you from destroying
Armed Protector Dragon

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:16.322
or dealing it any damage!

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:19.492
Oh and did I mention that every
time my Armed Protector Dragon

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:23.963
is shielded by an equip spell,
it gains 500 attack points?

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:24.831
Kite's in a tough spot.

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:27.033
He can't defeat the Number
if he doesn't destroy

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:27.867
Armed Protector Dragon!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.871
And he can't do that unless he
destroys Protect Shield first!

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.673
But that won't happen!

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:35.575
And I can thank
Armed Protector Dragon's

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.677
second special ability for that!

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:39.512
It prevents you
from destroying any card

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:42.782
equipped onto Armed
Protector Dragon.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.085
What?
Uh-oh.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:46.953
This is troublesome.

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:49.622
Both Armed Protector Dragon
and Dragon Shield

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.357
have effects that
defend one another.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:54.360
Played together, they become
an indestructible defense

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.029
and neither can be destroyed.

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.967
I end my turn!

00:15:01.968 --> 00:15:03.536
Then it's my move!

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:05.071
I draw!

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:10.543
I play Overlay Sentinel!

00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:17.116
And it lets me
summon Overlay Booster!

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.856
Our duel field won't get
too crowded because...

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.691
they won't be
sticking around for long.

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:29.562
Next, I tribute my Overlay
Sentinel and Booster!

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:38.037
I summon the monster
more savage than a supernova!

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:38.838
A cosmic scourge

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.941
that vaporizes
anything in its path...

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.445
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:47.113
Yeah, Galaxy-Eyes!

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.149
But I wonder if it'll be enough
to find a way around

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.084
Jinlon's defense?

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:52.919
I see a way.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.387
Kite's Dragon can break through

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.689
his unbreakable strategy.

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.658
It could?
How?

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.760
Don't you remember?

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.463
Galaxy-Eyes has a special
ability where it can banish

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.766
itself and the opponent's
monster from play.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:09.302
So if Kite removes
Armed Protector Dragon

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.169
from the field,

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.938
Dragon Shield will be destroyed

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.407
since it'll have nothing
to guard.

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:15.374
Doesn't it ring a bell?

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.710
Kite used the same
move to clobber you.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.012
Right, how could I forget?

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.848
(roaring)

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.450
I have been eager to
see your dragon.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.887
Well, you'll wish you had
never seen it once I give you

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:29.589
a taste of its power!

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:31.457
Do not count on it!

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:31.858
Why not?

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:35.394
Because Dragluon's other
special ability activates.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.331
It negates the special
ability of other dragons,

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.733
such as your Galaxy-Eyes!

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.573
No!
Galaxy-eyes!

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:56.949
No!
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:00.710
(Jinlon)
Now like a mouse in
a trap you are stuck!

00:17:01.244 --> 00:17:03.421
Without your Dragon's
special ability,

00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:04.890
you cannot break my defense.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.494
You might say that I've
clipped your Dragon's wings.

00:17:09.494 --> 00:17:09.995
Think again!

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.797
You've put together a solid
defense, I'll give you that.

00:17:12.797 --> 00:17:13.665
It's as if you built
a brick wall

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:17.202
around your field to keep
you safe from being attacked.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:20.438
But what you didn't count on
was me being a wrecking ball,

00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:23.308
ready to smash your defense
apart with the spell

00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:25.043
Book of Moon!

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:29.814
It switches one of your
face-up monsters facedown.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.052
Aww, yeah!

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:35.553
Very cunning indeed.

00:17:35.553 --> 00:17:37.389
I'm sure you know an equip spell

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.590
can't be used on a monster

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.558
that's facedown in defense mode.

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:43.762
So say bye-bye to
Dragon Shield!

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:45.430
But the best part of all,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.867
Dragluon now has to
come out of hiding!

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:49.601
Seeing your Dragon again

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.970
reminds me of how bad
I want to take it down.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.174
And to do that, what's left of
your defense has got to go!

00:17:56.174 --> 00:17:59.044
Now, Galaxy-Eyes,
let's finish this!

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:01.446
Destroy Armed Protector Dragon!

00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:04.482
Go Photon Stream of Destruction!

00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:11.423
Yeah!

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.892
Galaxy-Eyes
is puttin' on the pressure!

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.860
You're completely wide open.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.729
Without your wall
of defense to hide behind,

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.165
there's nothing keeping me
from beating you.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.733
Oh, I can't say I agree.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.768
But I will say you are
doing quite well!

00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:25.870
You see, this
duel is really a test.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.306
You faced my 'wall of defense,'
as you call it,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.008
and brought it down!

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.644
I am quite pleased
with your performance.

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:33.712
So far.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:34.579
Yeah, like I care.

00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:38.149
I don't need you grading
my dueling, understand?

00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:39.617
Okay, okay, sheesh.

00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:42.620
Boy I'd think you've gotta be
the grouchiest duelist

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.622
I have ever battled!

00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:45.623
(chuckling)

00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:48.793
You and Mizar really
are birds of a feather.

00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:51.429
Same anger and passion
for dueling.

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:53.732
Not to mention your egos.

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:54.666
Be quiet.

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.501
I am nothing like him.

00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:57.802
We shall see.

00:18:57.802 --> 00:19:00.739
Hopefully your
actions echo your words.

00:19:00.872 --> 00:19:04.109
You know what the best part
of your test is, Kite?

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:06.778
That I get to see
if you really have the spirit

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.847
to go all the way
with this duel.

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:11.282
Now then, there's one more
obstacle in your way

00:19:11.282 --> 00:19:12.117
before you get to me.

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:12.751
Are you ready, Kite?

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:16.287
I was born ready to handle
anything you can throw at me.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.325
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:25.563
This is the place...

00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:28.600
The Mythyrian Number
must be up there.

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:36.775
There is no
mistaking the power I sense.

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.977
There is a dragon nearby.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.247
My turn!

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:43.982
I draw!

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:47.819
I activate Dragluon's
special ability!

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.622
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:53.591
I can summon
a Dragon from my hand!

00:19:53.591 --> 00:19:55.193
(roaring)

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.596
Come forth, Soul Drain Dragon!

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.674
So this means that Dragluon
can go back into hiding!

00:20:09.674 --> 00:20:11.843
Like it did before.

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.411
Your friends are half right.

00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:13.978
Just like before,

00:20:13.978 --> 00:20:17.382
you can't harm my Number with
a new Dragon on my field.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.349
But to keep things interesting,

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:21.686
there's a brand-new twist to
my strategy this time, Kite.

00:20:21.686 --> 00:20:23.855
Soul Drain Dragon
gains attack points

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:26.491
equal to your life points.

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.560
Are you serious?

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:29.994
Afraid so.

00:20:29.994 --> 00:20:31.396
You have 4,000 life points.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:32.831
That means my Soul Drain Dragon

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.967
gains just as many
attack points!

00:20:43.174 --> 00:20:46.778
That monster's a powerhouse!

00:20:47.278 --> 00:20:49.647
And one last thing
for you to worry about.

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.117
Even if you do manage to
destroy this monster,

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:55.854
you will take damage equal
to half its attack points.

00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:56.554
Whoa, no way!

00:20:56.554 --> 00:20:59.824
So if Kite tries to destroy
Soul Drain Dragon,

00:20:59.824 --> 00:21:01.426
he'll lose the duel instantly.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.661
But if he doesn't end up
destroying it,

00:21:03.661 --> 00:21:04.863
a single attack from it will be

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:09.033
enough to annihilate all his
life points anyway.

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:13.104
This duel has
taken a turn for the worse!

00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:16.674
Kite will lose if he does not
destroy his opponent's dragon.

00:21:16.674 --> 00:21:19.644
However, he cannot do so,
because it has too many

00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:20.745
attack points.

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:24.816
This is one test that is
difficult to overcome.

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:28.052
You played a good duel,
but playtime is over!

00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:30.288
(laughing maniacally)
