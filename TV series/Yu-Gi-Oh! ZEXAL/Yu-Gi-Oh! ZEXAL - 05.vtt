00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.490
Shopkeeper: Come and
get it everyone!

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.890
Tasty snacks and
treats for sale.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.260
Everything half off!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.230
They won't last long.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.690
Flip: Half off?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.190
Hmm, let's see here

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.330
mm-hmm, and this one?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.460
Yep!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.290
They're all half price but
that's only half the story.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.690
This food's so cheap because
it's past its expiration date!

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.760
Woman in crowd: Disgusting!

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.860
I don't want this!

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.930
Toss it back!

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.290
Kid, what are you doing?

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.160
You're costing me money!

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.290
I'm just telling the
other side of things!

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.960
Everything has two sides...

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.690
just like in a duel, there's a
Winner and a loser.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.730
Then bring it on, kid!

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.160
And now

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.630
I play the trap card...

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.930
Ultra c!

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690
What, ultra c?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.160
Yep and next I summon
grenosaurus!

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.730
[Roaring]

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360
ahhhh!

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.890
That's for tryin' to pull one
over on us!

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.030
Se the truth is...

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.760
the food had no expiration date
to begin with!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.330
That's life for ya

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.430
for every up, there's a down.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.960
for every yes, there's a no.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.990
every coin has two sides.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.490
otherwise put, everything has
its flip side!

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.990
Girl a: Weird

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.760
TORI: Hey! You!

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.660
And I get by in This world by
exposing that side!

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.190
Robot: Trash identified

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.930
on everything I come across!

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.890
Error Malfunction

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.290
make that everything and
everyone.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.390
Like him.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.360
Yuma tsukumo.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.760
Yuma: Gotta hurry...

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.630
Grandma won't be happy if I'm
late for manicotti Monday!

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.430
Astral: That boy

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490
yuma is infamous for being a
terrible duelist

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.890
yet he defeated shark...

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.260
a duelist so good he made it to
the nationals.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.760
there is definitely a flip side
to that coin

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.830
and with the help of this card,
i'm gonna find it out.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.230
i'll give yuma this little guy
in exchange for a duel.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.060
and then I'll learn
what I need to know!

STUDENTS: Do you have a copy of
last night's homework?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030
Students: I left mine at home.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.830
Bronk: Astral?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.290
Yep, that's what he says he
wants me to call him.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.930
And he's here now?

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.460
Of course he's here, bronk.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.160
He's here all the time.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.230
And to be honest, it can be
quite awkward...

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.690
especially when I wake up with
him hovering over me.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.790
Duel time

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.090
and another thing, keep it down
when I'm sleeping, would ya?

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.360
Oh, please

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.530
you snorer!

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.530
What?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.990
Am not!

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.590
Do ya think we should leave?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.730
Yes, very slowly.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.290
Hey yuma, how's it going, Buddy?

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.730
Who are you?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.460
The name is flip.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.860
And I take quite a bit of pride
in that name.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.330
Cuz I believe everything
has a flip side.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.960
My right has my left.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.590
My front...my back.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.990
My frowny face has...

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.990
my Smiley face!

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.530
See.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.760
Pleased to meet ya.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.190
Yeah

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.960
Oh, before I forget, I have a
little something for you, yuma!

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.830
It's an xyz monster,
baby tiragon!

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.660
And you're giving it to me?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.530
Yep, for taking down
that bully, shark.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.160
Go on, yuma, don't be shy.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.360
Take it.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.990
It can be a symbol of
our new friendship.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.030
Symbol of friendship, huh?

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.830
I'd have to be a jerk to turn
that down!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.890
what is this dark Aura flowing
from this boy?

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.390
something is not right.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.890
that's right, don't be afraid,
just reach out and take it.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.130
Well if you insist

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.360
alright!

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360
Yuma!

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.690
We're gonna be late for class.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.760
C'mon, let's go.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.960
Ahhhh!

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.630
If you moved your legs, it might
help a little.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.030
But that card!

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.790
I want it!

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.760
Sorry yuma, but that kid is
nothing but trouble.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.490
Whadaya mean,
how would you know?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.830
We know cuz Tori and I used to
be in the same class with him.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.090
And I'm telling you,
he's always up to no good!

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.360
Always!

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.730
What?

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.190
That little guy?

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.430
Please, what's the worst he
could do?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.730
you may have resisted the bait
this time, yuma

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.160
but just like a coin, fate
won't always land in your favor

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
very soon, I'm taking you down!

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.790
Mr.Kay: So as you can plainly
see, finding the percentage

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.330
of air in this vial of sand is
the easiest way to

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.230
this is a complex structure.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.530
what is its purpose?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.360
but more importantly, what role
does yuma play?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.030
oh my could this be?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.860
Hey yuma, here's your card...

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.760
ahhh!

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.530
Yuma!

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.630
Ahhh!

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.860
Your card

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.430
-Come on!
-Heyyyyy!

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.530
Your card!

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.790
Let's go.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.360
You've gotta keep
your guard up, yuma!

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.330
No kidding, but from flip or
from you two?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.430
Curses!

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.030
Tori and bronk won't
let me near yuma!

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.230
I'm going to have to change my
strategy a bit.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.360
Spencer: I lost my xyz monster,
anyone see it?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.390
hey, that's Spencer.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.390
he has a class with yuma.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.330
i can use him.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.030
What? Are you for real?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.830
Absolutely!

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.260
Then you've got yourself a deal!

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.790
Yes! This must be my lucky day!

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.890
Alright!

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.160
yet Another flip Side

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.190
this Kid loses something and I
find my plan!

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.260
I'm home!

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Kari: Yuma!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.130
Didn't I tell you to
do more homework

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.830
and to stop with all the
dueling?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.760
Yeah, ya did and I am

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.560
then what is this?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.490
Ahhh!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.460
To my dueling hero, yuma.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.530
From your biggest admirer.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.990
Ah,cool!

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.960
It's fan mail!

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960
I mean not cool!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.690
-Bye!
-Yuma!

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.790
When is he going to learn that
no dueling means no dueling?

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.630
Can you talk to him?

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.060
I'm just worried,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.330
grandma, because we both no what
dueling can lead to.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.260
Hey, where have you
been hiding out?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.130
Anyway, look whatcha missed.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.830
My first fan mail.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.760
I'm so excited I can't
wait to see it!

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.260
Hello?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.130
Don't think maybe a
congratulation is in order here?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.990
Someone out there likes me.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.690
Wish I could meet 'em and give
'em a big hug and an autograph!

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.130
So

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.560
tell me why your sister does not
want you dueling.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.790
Don't worry about my sister.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.860
Now then, let's rip
this baby open!

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.360
observation #8,
humans have ears,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.230
but that does not
mean they listen.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.860
Hey, this is a
baby tiragon card

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.430
just like the one
flip tried to give me.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.360
Hi yuma!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360
I saved up for a year
to get you this!

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.760
I hope you like it!

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.930
Wow!

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.630
I'm the luckiest guy around!

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.960
Ha!

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.760
I can't believe I've gotta
an xyz monster!

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.060
Yes, indeed you do, yuma.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.730
And I've got you right
where I want ya.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.430
But that card's just the start

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.660
next

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.730
the plan is to get you all alone
and friendless.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.860
Then you'll be at my mercy!

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.760
Good morning!

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.360
CASWELL: Yuma!

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.730
You have got a lot of nerve
showing your face

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.130
around here after everything
that you've done!

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.190
Uh, what exactly did I do?

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.290
I know it's hard,
but don't play dumb.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.830
You know the least you
could do is admit it.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.230
We've all seen the photos.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.290
They were sent out to
the whole school.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.530
And all I have to say is you
should be ashamed of yourself.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.030
Stomping on flowerbeds.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.630
Pulling pranks on teachers.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.690
Cheating during exams.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.260
But the worst thing you did was
eat Spencer's lunch...

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.630
and replace it...

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.590
with a toad!

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.790
Check out the look on your face.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.830
Whoa

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.690
I didn't do that!

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.230
Hey, where's Spencer?

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.760
I gotta clear my name.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.760
We can't find Spencer!

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.690
He must be home
sick or something.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.290
Still, we're with yuma.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.360
There's no way he'd
do those things!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.390
I used to feel the
same way, bronk.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.860
We all did...

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.790
that is, until we saw these
awful pictures.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.790
Sorry yuma but we're
not friends anymore.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.360
Come on everybody, let's go.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.490
Wait... please, no!

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.030
I guess in the end, there's
another side to yuma

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.460
a side we never knew.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.660
But I swear, I'm innocent!

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.430
time for step 2.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.790
Man

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.260
it sure stinks having everyone
upset at you.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.830
Well,I guess bronk
and Tori aren't

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.490
but the rest of
the school sure is!

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.190
Yuma!

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.090
Hey, how's it going, pal!

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.390
Hey, flip

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.330
[devious giggle]

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.130
Wow, it sounds like you got a
bum rap!

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.360
Tell me about it.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.260
Now I'm the school outcast.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.830
That is not True, yuma.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.160
You are no outcast.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.360
Huh?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.690
Like I said before,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.030
I've liked you ever since I
heard you beat shark.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.890
That was one of the best duels
ever!

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.730
Wow, really?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.560
Thanks.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.060
By the way,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.290
what was that card that you used
to take down shark, you know.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.390
You mean utopia?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.930
Oh right, that was it.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.530
so, that's his secret weapon.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.890
strange that dark Aura is
getting stronger.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.490
this is quite troubling.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.830
Well, yuma, no matter what
anyone says about you,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.990
remember that flip always has
got your back.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.990
what was that?

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.290
In that case

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.030
you know what would really cheer
me up, a friendly duel!

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.430
I was hoping you'd ask, yuma.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.730
I'd love to!

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.960
Really?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.090
Oh, absolutely.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.330
In fact, 'ol pal

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.160
I insist on it!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.190
Ha! Yeah! Let's do this then!

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.590
yes, let's.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.760
and once we're finished,
utopia will be mine!

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.890
I have a bad feeling
about this duel.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.660
I think you should pass.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.530
What for?

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.230
Wait, lemme guess you think that
flip is up to no good too.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.230
Well then why would he stand by
me in my time of need?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.560
Wait a second, you're not
jealous are ya?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.790
Uh, are you talking to me, yuma?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.560
Nope, just to myself.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.060
Anyway, let's get
on with this duel!

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.260
Because I am feeling the flow!

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.930
Duel Gazerlet's roll!

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.290
Duel Interface set!

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:27.060
Computer voice: Augmented
reality Visual Link established!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.890
Let's duel!

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.090
I'll go first if it's okay

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.490
here goes...draw!

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.430
I place a monster facedown in
defense mode!

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.290
That's it for this turn!

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.490
Playing it safe by Shoring up
your defenses, huh?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.090
I'd better play it safe when I'm
facing a duelist

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.590
as good as you are, yuma!

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.230
I believe your opponent's praise
is masking his True motives.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.260
No, he just thinks I'm a
great duelist!

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.030
Is that so hard to believe?

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.590
Wait a sec, don't answer that.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.590
Let's get back to the duel.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.930
since flip summoned a monster
in defense mode.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.430
it's played facedown.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.530
now I can't see how strong a
defense it has,

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.730
unless I attack it.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.760
But if I do attack and his
monster's stronger

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.090
than my monster
i'm gonna take damage.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.630
Get set to get decked!

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.760
I draw!

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.890
i Gotta summon a monster with
high attack points!

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:27.090
I summon gagaga magician!

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.390
Now gagaga magician, attack that
facedown monster.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.490
i was hoping Yuma would side
with This aggressive approach.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:46.430
Porcupine fish, appear!

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.290
400 defense points?!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.090
All right - Gagaga magician
wins!

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.930
Flip effectactivate!

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.360
What's a 'flip eff

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.660
you must have missed that day of
school yuma.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.730
It's a special ability that
activates

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.230
when a monster that's facedown
is flipped face-up.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.530
Wanna know what
its flip effect is?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.990
You now take 400
points of damage!

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.930
Pretty Cool move!

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.130
But gagaga magician still has
higher attack points!

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.490
My monster!

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.230
Better Luck next time!

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.130
I end my turn.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.660
Well played,
but I expected no less!

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.960
Still, I took away life points

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.260
from the mighty
yuma tsukumo, yeah ha!

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.630
The duelist that took down the
infamous shark!

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.730
-What an achievement!
-He sure is happy.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.030
Interesting, so he is a flip
effect monster user.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.230
Okay, thank you!

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.360
I don't get it,
Spencer's mom said

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.130
that he went to school today
like he always does.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.190
Yeah.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.130
But he's nowhere to be found.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.090
Hey, maybe there's a hint as to
what's going on in those photos.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.230
Ya think?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.590
It's worth checking!

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.190
Anything that will
prove yuma's innocence.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.430
My turn.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.560
Here we go!

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.690
I play a monster in defense
mode!

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.890
Facedown again.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.890
He must be planning to use
another flip effect!

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.990
Then I'll end my turn
with two facedowns!

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.890
yuma Had better be careful.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.460
Flip's field is stacked.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.630
Alright, my turn!

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.160
I draw!

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.990
First I summon full elf!

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.390
And now I'll use it to attack
your facedown monster!

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.930
But yuma, do you not recall what
happened last time?

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.430
Of course!

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.530
But who cares if I take flip
effect Damage

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.790
if full elf destroys that
facedown monster,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.130
I can attack flip directly with
my magician!

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.330
Now go!

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.360
Full Elf

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.390
attack that facedown monster!

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.360
Yes, please do!

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.890
Full Elf attack flip's
facedown monster!

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:04.090
Chew bone, appear!

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.830
300 defense points?!

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.860
that'll be a piece
of cake to beat!

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.290
And now for

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.360
Chew bone's flip effect!

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.990
With it, I can summon up to
three Chew bone jrs

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:19.630
from my deck Onto your
field in defense mode.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.790
Huh?

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.690
You summoned them to my field?

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.590
I am so cool!

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.330
Did ya see how I pulled that
sweet summoning off?

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.430
Yeah, I sure did,
flip but they won't do you

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.330
a whole lotta Good way over here
on my field!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.530
What? Your field?

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.460
Aw nuts, I misunderstood
the effect!

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.990
So you say.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.560
Aw, don't beat
yourself up over it!

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.460
Happens to us all!

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.830
But a duel's a duel.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.090
Can't let ya off the hook!

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.930
I now attack you directly with
gagaga magician!

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.790
Ahhh!

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.330
Yes!

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.790
I'm winning 3600
life points to 2500!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.030
And with that, I'll end my...

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.190
Whoa, wait!

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.630
Hold up there!

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.990
Aren't you gonna summon
your xyz monster?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.690
My xyz?

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.160
the guy doesn't even realize!

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.560
You know, because of the
summoning mistake I just made?

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.390
Huh?

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.030
The mistake I made
that brought out

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.690
the three level 1 Chew bone jrs.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.060
Right, I've got three level 1
monsters out!

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.390
Which means I can
do an xyz summon!

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.260
then do it already!

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.860
There's no doubt.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.130
Yuma's being set up.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.630
But why?

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.230
Wait a moment, of course!

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.530
I overlay these three level 1
Chew bone jrs!

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.560
Next

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.860
no!

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.330
I will use This overlay network
to summon forth

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.230
an xyz monster!

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.190
Appear, baby tiragon!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:10.390
[♪...]

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.630
alright, I did it, I summoned an
xyz monster!

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.430
[ Erie laughter]

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.190
Huh?

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.590
You sap!

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.130
You bought it!

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.060
I bought what?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.030
My right facedown
is the trap uratra c.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.590
Uratra c?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.460
Thanks to uratra c

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.030
When baby tiragon is summoned
out to your field

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.660
I can summon one xyz
monster to my field!

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.130
Oh and there's one more thing

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.760
I have to summon it straight
from your deck!

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.460
My deck?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.690
Yep!

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.760
Which means

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.330
utopia

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.060
is all mine!

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.990
You summoning baby tiragon

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.260
was the worst thing that could
have happened to you.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.560
Flip planned this
from the very start.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.430
In order to get you to summon
baby tiragon,

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.430
he purposely summoned those Chew
bone jrs to your field.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.960
No, that's impossible, I mean
think about it,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.960
flip didn't even know that I
owned that baby tiragon!

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.930
[Devious chuckle]

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.160
I saved up for a
year to get you this!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.630
Ahhh!

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.960
I hope you like it.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.160
Wait, so then that
card was sent by you?

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.130
That's right...

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.890
and, I was also the one who sent
around all those fake photos

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.490
of you to the entire school

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.330
I knew it would
make everyone hate you.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.590
But why?!

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.230
because I needed to get you
alone, yuma!

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.890
And besides, I knew if you were
down about everyone disowning

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.090
you as their friend, you'd
finally let me be your friend.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.860
And friends duel!

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.190
And that note on your back tells
you what we're dueling for!

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.460
What in the world?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.530
Bet this doesn't say 'kick me'.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.530
if I lose this duel, I agree to
give flip a card from my deck.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.630
This is not good.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.560
That's no fair!

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.760
That note was on you so you must
honor it...ha!

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.390
What a snake!

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.290
My friends warned me that you
were always up to no good!

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.690
Haha!

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.960
I guess this is what I get for
not listening to them,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.130
so fine, which card of mine is
it that we're playing for?

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.090
Why the card you beat shark
with, of course,

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.890
your utopia card!

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.630
Utopia is a number card.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.690
If yuma loses that, then I too
shall be lost!

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.690
Now that we know the stakes

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.190
let's get on with the duel,
shall we!

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.530
Now Ultra c!

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.030
Activate!

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.060
And with your power, I summon
utopia from yuma's deck!

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.530
Rise up

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.860
utopia!

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.330
So now I gotta take
on my best monster?

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.400
This isn't gonna be easy.
