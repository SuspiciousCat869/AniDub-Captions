WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.238
(Yuma)
Last time on "YuGiOh ZEXAL..."

00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:05.244
(Yuma) That road leads
to Astral World!

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:08.382
This other side connects
back to Earth!

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:11.722
But why is Heartland City
still Barian-fied?

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.493
Don Thousand's power still
remains.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.764
His chaos energy is
keeping Earth

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:19.169
and Barian World
fused together.

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.204
It's also pulling our worlds

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:22.776
into a collision course with
Astral World.

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.546
If our three worlds collide,

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.351
Astral World will be destroyed.

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.754
(all gasp)

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.557
But since we defeated him,

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:32.561
Don Thousand's power
should be gone.

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.769
It's not, because I inherited
Don Thousand's energies.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.242
Barian World and Astral
World are sworn enemies.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.746
If you want to save
Astral World,

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:45.484
you'll have to defeat me!

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:46.453
All right.

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:48.791
Let's duel.
Let's duel.

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:51.495
Why would Shark summon
monsters onto our field?

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:56.237
There's still one Barian monster
missing from this party!

00:00:56.237 --> 00:01:01.815
Mizar's Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:02.817
(roaring)

00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:06.457
Now that the seven Barians
are back together,

00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:10.163
you have no chance!

00:01:10.163 --> 00:01:13.503

When you take on me,

00:02:14.183 --> 00:02:17.388
you take on all seven
Barian Emperors!

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:22.165
Together, we can summon
our most powerful monster!

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:25.570
Barian World's
most powerful monster♪

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.875
This guardian is so mighty

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:29.145
that it can only be summoned

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.883
by overlaying all seven
Barian Numbers

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.621
in the ultimate Xyz Summoning!

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.862
I overlay Silent Honor,
Ragnafinity,

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:41.200
Archfiend Seraph, Neo Tachyon,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.677
Giant Red Hand, Comet Cestus
and Masquerade.

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.647
With these seven monsters,

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.686
I build the ultimate
Overlay Network!

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:57.197
Feast your eyes on Chaos Xyz
Barian Hope!

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:13.927
This looks bad.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.898
Keep your guard up, Yuma.

00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:18.736
Gee, ya think?

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.807
The other Emperors
may have fallen,

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:22.711
but they're far from defeated.

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:25.349
I'm going to keep fighting
for each and every one of them

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.321
because I know they'd do
the same for me.

00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:30.458
For the glory of Barian World,

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.833
we will defeat you
and destroy Astral World.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.371
That's a promise!

00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:39.575
You've got to be kidding me.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.512
Seven on two isn't fair.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:42.681
This was unforeseen.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:46.956
To win we will need to expect
the unexpected.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:53.234
At last, the seven Emperors
will fight as one!

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:54.670
Aah!

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.939
This is wild!

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.178
Shark's blast almost knocked me
off my feet!

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.416
His power is limitless!

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.520
I will guarantee Barian World's
future

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.629
by making Astral World a thing
of the past!

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.408
You've had your fun,
but now you're done!

00:04:15.408 --> 00:04:18.281
Barian Hope gains
1,000 attack points

00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.952
for every one of its
Overlay Units!

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:22.990
That's 7,000 attack points.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.992
Yuma, play your trap!

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:28.466
Right! I activate the trap
Overlay Assistance!

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.336
When I have no cards
in my hand,

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:35.512
I get to draw a card for every
Overlay Unit that you have.

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:40.956
So I draw seven cards!

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:44.997
That's a small price to pay for
what Barian Hope can do.

00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:49.004
By using one Overlay Unit,
or paying 400 life points,

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.342
it can activate the special
ability

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:54.013
of one of the seven
Barian Numbers!

00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:54.748
What? No way!

00:04:54.748 --> 00:04:59.390
That's like facing all seven
Barian Numbers simultaneously!

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.734
And it's nearly impossible
to beat even a single one!

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:09.576
I can only use each of their
special abilities once per turn,

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:13.650
but that'll be more
than enough to crush you.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.923
I pay 400 life points!

00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:20.563
That lets me activate

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:25.038
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon's
special ability!

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.042
Not only does it negate
the effects

00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:28.878
of all other cards
on the field,

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:31.550
but it transcends time and
returns all cards

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.023
to the way they were at the
beginning of the turn!

00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:39.030
So Utopia can't use
its special abilities!

00:05:41.568 --> 00:05:42.570
Furthermore,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.010
you can't activate any cards
without my permission!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.783
I pay 400 more life points!

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:53.023
I activate Chaos Number 102:

00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:55.896
Archfiend Seraph's
special ability!

00:05:55.896 --> 00:06:01.305
Your Utopia loses all of its
attack points!

00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.064
Utopia!

00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:18.939
I pay 400 life points again!

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:24.081
My sister's Ragnafinity will
send chills down your spine!

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:27.354
Since Utopia lost 2,500
attack points,

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:30.760
you take 2,500 points
of damage!

00:06:32.597 --> 00:06:37.105
But you only have 2,400
life points!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.107
And since you can't activate

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:42.916
any card on your field to stop
the damage, you're finished!

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:44.085
Oh, you think?

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:45.521
'Cause I don't!

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:47.424
I activate
the trap Ant Barrier!

00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:52.801
I can't activate any card on my
field, but I can from my hand!

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:55.974
Ant Barrier switches Utopia
to defense mode.

00:06:55.974 --> 00:06:59.681
And it chains up your monster
so that it can't attack.

00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.788
It's all tied up
with nowhere to go.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:05.859
Very cute.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:10.134
If you think you outsmarted me,
well, think again.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.505
I can handle anything
you dish out!

00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:15.678
I'll pay 400 more life points

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:18.482
to activate Chaos Number 106:

00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:20.787
Giant Red Hand's special
ability!

00:07:20.787 --> 00:07:26.698
Its humongous fist smashes your
puny Ant Barrier into pieces!

00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:28.067
Huh?
What?

00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:32.508
Barian Hope is free!

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.581
Next, Alito steps
into the ring!

00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:38.152
I pay 400 life points to
activate

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:42.594
Battlin ' Boxer Comet Cestus" '
special ability!

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:47.169
Barian Hope automatically KO's
your Utopia!

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:00.827
Astral, Utopia's gone!

00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:02.798
And you'll be a goner, too.

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:09.811
Chaos Xyz Barian Hope,
annihilate Yuma and Astral!

00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:12.048
Oh, you're not taking me
down that easily.

00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:16.891
Not as long as I have Gagaga
Guardian to protect me!

00:08:17.592 --> 00:08:19.195
When you attack me directly,

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:23.503
I can summon this big fella
in defense mode.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.173
Whatever.

00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:28.612
Nothing you do will save you.

00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:34.624
Take the stage,
Umbral Horror Masquerade!

00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:39.032
Buckle your seatbelts because
we're taking you for a ride!

00:08:39.032 --> 00:08:42.205
A ride to the dark side!

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.213
Oh!

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:50.186
First, say bye bye bye
to your Gagaga!

00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:54.728
Then I send one random card in
your hand to the graveyard!

00:08:56.197 --> 00:08:58.201
And for the finishing touch,

00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.543
Masquerade cuts your
life points in half!

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.914
Aah!

00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.752
Yuma! Astral!

00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:09.489
Uhh!

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:12.227
You're all out of options.

00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:17.136
Barian Hope, destroy them
once and for all!

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:21.511
Yuma.

00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:24.249
Good-bye, Yuma!

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:25.251
Save your good-byes!

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:29.126
But say hello to
my Rainbow Kuriboh.

00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:31.630
My pal resurrects
from my graveyard

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.903
to defend me from your attack!

00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:37.741
Fine.

00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:42.116
I'll just flatten
that floating cream puff!

00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:46.692
No matter what we do,

00:09:46.692 --> 00:09:49.263
Shark is always
one step ahead of us.

00:09:49.263 --> 00:09:50.765
For sure.
But we haven't lost,

00:09:50.765 --> 00:09:52.536
and that's what's
most important.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:57.745
Even mutant cockroaches don't
live as long as you two!

00:09:57.745 --> 00:10:02.487
I activate the spell card
Chaos Tempest Draw!

00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:08.231
It destroys all the spell
and trap cards on the field!

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.277
Then I draw a card for every
card that was destroyed.

00:10:15.277 --> 00:10:17.148
That's a total of three cards.

00:10:17.148 --> 00:10:22.290
I place all three facedown
and end my turn.

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:25.730
(sighs) We survived.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.565
Yes, indeed.

00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:29.203
Shark holds
an overwhelming lead.

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:31.307
But one thing puzzles me.

00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:31.876
Huh?

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:34.313
Instead of using Barian Hope's
Overlay Units,

00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:37.018
why would he give up
his own life points

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:38.755
to activate its
special abilities?

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:42.762
He could have had a massive
life-point advantage over us.

00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:46.636
But instead, we actually have
more life points than him.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.244
I think I know why.

00:10:51.244 --> 00:10:52.180
Huh?

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.748
Because...

00:10:52.748 --> 00:10:58.324
each of those Overlay Units
represents a Barian Emperor.

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:01.330
So if he uses them,

00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:05.337
it 's like he" 's getting rid of
one of his friends.

00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:07.074
Yes, I see.

00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:10.781
Shark would never turn his back
on the other Emperors.

00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:12.685
Because just like us, Astral,

00:11:12.685 --> 00:11:15.289
they share an unbreakable bond.

00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:17.627
Shark's fighting
for his friends

00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:20.666
like we're fighting for ours.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:24.340
Yuma, I'm feeling confused.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.209
I am battling Barian World

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:28.247
so that Astral World
may survive.

00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:31.019
But now, does the survival
of my world

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:32.922
justify the loss of theirs?

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:35.360
No, it definitely doesn't!
Huh?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.833
That's why I'll save everyone!

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:40.370
I won't pick and choose.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.372
I'll save us all.

00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:46.347
Astral World, Earth,
even Barian World, got it?

00:11:46.347 --> 00:11:48.351
Then allow me to assist.

00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:50.756
Okay, let's do this.

00:11:54.362 --> 00:11:54.930
Go!

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.067
When two kindred spirits unite,

00:11:57.067 --> 00:12:00.373
their future has no limits!

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:05.784
Ultimate ZEXAL Morph!

00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:07.253
All right!

00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:10.693
Now, let's go!

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:19.375
Even with the power of ZEXAL,
I'll still beat you!

00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:35.105
What's happening?

00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:36.407
Oh.

00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:39.212
Hey, who stepped on
the gas pedal?

00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:43.186
Earth's heading this way
even faster than before!

00:12:43.186 --> 00:12:45.424
Why is this happening.
Astral?

00:12:45.424 --> 00:12:47.695
As our duel intensifies,

00:12:47.695 --> 00:12:49.398
we release greater
amounts of energy,

00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:51.802
pulling our worlds
closer together

00:12:51.802 --> 00:12:52.938
much stronger than before.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:58.048
The results will be
more devastating than
previously calculated.

00:12:58.048 --> 00:12:59.684
Oh! Oh, no!

00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:01.821
So if the three worlds collide,

00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:03.959
then we're all done for!

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:05.161
(Astral)
There is a high probability

00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:08.434
that the rest of the galaxy
will not survive as well.

00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:11.940
There has to be some way
to stop this!

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.311
(rumbling)

00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:22.058
(man) Oh, no!

00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:25.365
What's happening?

00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:26.667
I can't believe it.

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:30.240
In the end, this just
might really be the end.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.877
Yuma.

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.914
Calm down, everybody!

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.317
Don't lose hope.

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:36.452
It's all we have left.

00:13:36.452 --> 00:13:39.792
I know it looks like
we don't stand a chance,

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:40.393
but that's not true.

00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:43.699
My friends are doing everything
they can to save our future

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:47.105
so that we don't become
a thing of the past!

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:48.775
Lillybot trusts in Yuma.

00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:49.910
They're right!

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.482
Yuma will prevent
a catastrophe.

00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:54.485
Yeah, he will!

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.427
Kazuma Tsukumo.

00:13:58.427 --> 00:14:01.465
My friend, can you hear me?

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:04.771
Byron Arclight, is that you?

00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:05.940
How you been?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.975
Your three kids and my Yuma

00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:09.713
certainly had their share
of ups and downs.

00:14:09.713 --> 00:14:11.484
More downs than ups.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:14.055
True, but when he saved us,

00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:18.063
that final up erased
all the downs.

00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:19.499
Quite a boy.

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:20.334
Listen, Kazuma,

00:14:20.334 --> 00:14:24.174
as much as I would love to
stroll down memory lane,

00:14:24.174 --> 00:14:25.844
Yuma is in trouble.

00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:27.146
Yes, I know.

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:29.250
The three worlds
will be destroyed

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.323
unless you do something
about it.

00:14:32.323 --> 00:14:32.756
But how?

00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:37.398
I hope whatever power
I have left is enough.

00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:49.388
Yuma!

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:53.529
Help is on the way!

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:54.898
Dad!

00:14:54.898 --> 00:14:58.538
Let's show these pups
what two old dogs can do.

00:14:58.538 --> 00:15:01.177
Old? Who are you
calling old?

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:03.514
Speak for yourself!

00:15:03.514 --> 00:15:05.417
Vetrix?

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:24.320
(Byron)
We'll hold back these worlds
as long as we can!

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.356
(Kazuma) Keep on dueling, Yuma!

00:15:26.356 --> 00:15:28.828
The future is in your hands!

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:32.335
We're safer now,
but we don't have much time.

00:15:32.335 --> 00:15:34.471
(Astral)
Yuma, you know what to do.

00:15:34.471 --> 00:15:35.406
Right.

00:15:35.406 --> 00:15:36.408
A truly powerful duelist

00:15:36.408 --> 00:15:37.544
can shape the outcome
of a duel.

00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:43.455
He can even generate the very
cards that he needs to draw!

00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:48.030
Destiny Shining Draw!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.565
(gasps)

00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:50.234
But that's only the beginning.

00:15:50.234 --> 00:15:54.276
I activate the spell
Overlay Reborn!

00:15:54.276 --> 00:15:57.882
I discard a monster card
from my hand.

00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:02.123
And then that lets me resurrect
an Xyz monster

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:04.160
that's always been by my side.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.804
Come on back, Number 39:
Utopia!

00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:15.581
And your monster loses Overlay
Units equal to Utopia's Rank!

00:16:15.581 --> 00:16:17.217
Utopia's Rank is four.

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:21.859
So Barian Hope loses
four Chaos Overlay Units.

00:16:21.859 --> 00:16:22.594
Not so fast!

00:16:22.594 --> 00:16:26.601
I've got a game-changing
surprise!

00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:33.614
(Yuma)
Your monster loses over
half its Overlay Units!

00:16:33.614 --> 00:16:35.218
I don't think so!

00:16:35.218 --> 00:16:38.023
I activate Overlay Menace!

00:16:38.023 --> 00:16:39.960
This trap stops
your Overlay Reborn

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.565
from getting rid
of my Overlay Units!

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:44.969
So you can keep your hands
to yourself!

00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:50.213
I also get to draw seven cards
and regain 3,500 life points!

00:16:50.213 --> 00:16:54.621
You tried to take me down,
but you only hurt yourself!

00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:55.355
He's right,

00:16:55.355 --> 00:17:00.632
because my Overlay Reborn drops
Utopia's attack points to zero.

00:17:00.866 --> 00:17:04.272
Nash is playing
his cards perfectly.

00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:04.639
Maybe.

00:17:04.873 --> 00:17:06.977
But I'm not gonna give up!

00:17:06.977 --> 00:17:11.085
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Astral Force!

00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:13.656
Eliphas risked his life
to give us this card

00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:17.163
because he believed it would
help us save the future.

00:17:17.163 --> 00:17:19.600
Let us prove that he was right!

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.469
(Yuma) Yeah!

00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:21.638
It's time to turn the tables

00:17:21.638 --> 00:17:24.042
because I'm so feeling
the flow!

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.415
Rank-Up Magic Astral Force
ranks up Utopia

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:30.187
into an even more powerful
monster!

00:17:30.187 --> 00:17:33.660
(both)
We rebuild the Overlay
Network!

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.133
(Yuma) Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:42.543
Shatter the boundaries
of reality!

00:17:47.252 --> 00:17:51.627
Arise anew, Number 39!

00:17:51.627 --> 00:17:55.067
Utopia Beyond!

00:18:26.392 --> 00:18:27.694
(gasps)

00:18:27.694 --> 00:18:29.263
(laughs)

00:18:29.263 --> 00:18:30.365
Utopia Beyond,

00:18:30.365 --> 00:18:35.141
soar into the sky
and attack Barian Hope!

00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:40.718
Have you lost your mind?

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:45.260
My monster has way more
attack points than yours!

00:18:54.243 --> 00:18:55.244
Utopia!

00:18:55.244 --> 00:18:56.715
Show 'em your true power!

00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:58.718
Utopia Beyond's special ability

00:18:58.952 --> 00:19:03.461
blasts Barian Hope's attack
points down to zero!

00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:04.095
Aah!

00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:06.399
Your monster's going down!

00:19:06.399 --> 00:19:09.672
Utopia Beyond,
destroy Barian Hope!

00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:10.741
Not happening!

00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:12.644
I activate Xyz Trip!

00:19:12.644 --> 00:19:17.252
This trap ends the battle by
deflecting your attack!

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:24.500
This is intense.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.234
On the down side,

00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.773
I now have to pay 3,000
life points,

00:19:27.773 --> 00:19:29.175
but it's a price
I'm willing to pay

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:32.715
to keep Barian Hope
on the field.

00:19:32.715 --> 00:19:34.752
Aah!

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:40.062
You okay?

00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:42.299
Is that the best you got?

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:46.774
I place three cards face down
and end my turn.

00:19:46.774 --> 00:19:47.776
Good!

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:52.251
That means Barian Hope gets all
its attack points back.

00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:55.256
Now, I...

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:56.459
draw!

00:19:56.459 --> 00:19:58.796
Chaos Xyz Barian Hope,

00:19:58.796 --> 00:20:04.240
attack Utopia Beyond
and end this duel!

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.613
I activate
the trap Weaker Overlay!

00:20:07.613 --> 00:20:10.651
Utopia Beyond gains
600 attack points

00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:15.394
for every one of your
monster's Overlay Units.

00:20:15.394 --> 00:20:17.799
And Barian Hope has seven!

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:19.535
That equals 4,200 points!

00:20:19.535 --> 00:20:23.810
My Utopia is now stronger
than Barian Hope!

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.212
Big mistake!

00:20:25.212 --> 00:20:27.383
Aah!

00:20:28.819 --> 00:20:29.821
Thanks to Ragnafinity,

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:33.635
since Utopia Beyond gained
4,200 attack points,

00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:36.604
you lose 4,200 life points!

00:20:36.604 --> 00:20:40.141
Game over, Yuma.

00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:42.310
Not yet, Shark.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.812
Now, go!

00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:45.480
Damage Reactor!

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.715
With this trap,
I don't take any damage,

00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:51.452
and Utopia Beyond gains
800 attack points.

00:20:51.452 --> 00:20:54.522
Thanks for the power boost.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.626
It has 8,000 attack points?

00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:01.329
Go, Utopia Beyond!

00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:05.066
Rising Sun Beyond Slash!

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.810
No!

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:19.681
Yeah!

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:26.821
You dare destroy the bond
I have with my friends?

00:21:29.424 --> 00:21:31.492
Yuma, Astral,

00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:35.196
I will make you pay!

00:23:07.155 --> 00:23:10.491
?
