WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.203
(Yuma)
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.738
(Yuma) Shark's gone.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.708
It's all my fault.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.743
(Tori) Hey, Flip's back!

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.346
(Astral)
Shark's defeat has
severed the fusion

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.014
between Barian World and Earth,

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:19.251
returning those that were
defeated in our skirmish.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.753
Aah!

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:24.756
Yuma, we have finally
accomplished our goal

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:27.758
of gathering all
100 Number Cards.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.059
Their combined energies

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.496
allow me to access
the Numeron Code.

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:34.732
It gives me
the power to rewrite

00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:36.599
both the future and the past.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.736
I shall use it
to fulfill my final mission

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.705
to annihilate Barian World.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.440
You may be my friend

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.741
but I can't let you do this!

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.744
And how do you plan
to stop me, Yuma?

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.747
Do you dare
challenge me
to a duel?

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:52.714
You bet!

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:54.216
Very well, but when I win,

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:58.486
I will use the Numeron Code
to erase your memories.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.255
It will be as if we never met.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:04.225
(Yuma)
Astral summoned
five Utopias!

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.092
(Sparrow)
Astral's kinda intense.

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:08.094
(Anna)
Actually,
he's pretty scary.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:08.728
What's gotten into him?

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:12.065
(Bronk)
Yeah, wasn't this supposed
to be a friendly duel?

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:17.102
Utopia Ray V
Rising Sun Star Slash!

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.374

(Astral)
Yuma, your decision to duel me
was extremely ill-advised.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:38.309
You must realize
you cannot defeat me.

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.577
Huh?

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:40.544
Now, Yuma,

00:02:40.544 --> 00:02:43.748
I activate the spell card
XYZ Treasure.

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:46.350
This allows me to draw one card

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.719
for every XYZ Monster
on the field.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.188
So I draw five cards.

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:53.323
Hah!

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:54.491
(all gasping)

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.594
I place three cards facedown.

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:00.529
Your move, Yuma.

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.131
(Trey) Astral's unstoppable!

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.033
Not only does he have
five Utopias,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.734
he just replenished
his entire hand too.

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:10.204
It's like watching a lion
play with his next appetizer.

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:12.273
None of this surprises me.

00:03:12.273 --> 00:03:14.542
Despite Yuma's
growth as a duelist,

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:18.111
he is still outclassed
and outmatched.

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:19.413
Looks like he's given up.

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:21.648
What do you expect
when your best friend

00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:22.516
is pummeling you to a pulp?

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:26.486
(Flip)
Guys, this friendly duel
is anything but friendly.

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.521
Astral really needs
to chill out.

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.223
He's dueling as if
Yuma is his worst enemy,

00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:33.125
and it's getting really ugly.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:34.627
So ugly I can't watch!

00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:38.730
(Tori)
Astral's going to
destroy Barian World?

00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:40.031
That's right.

00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.734
And I'm the only one
who can stop him.

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:44.736
By winning our duel.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.439
(thinking):
If they only knew the truth.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.707
Yuma, even with
your limited intellect,

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:53.610
it must be clear that
it is pointless to continue.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.945
(laughter) (gasping)

00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:59.015
(laughing) Why would I give up?

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.150
(all gasping)

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.686
This is, like,
the best duel ever!

00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:06.456
Whenever I played
any of the Utopias,

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.724
I could only see them
from behind,

00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:11.426
so I never knew what they
looked like face-to-face.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:12.661
And, oh man, they're cooler

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.731
and more intimidating
than I ever imagined!

00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:16.732
This is so awesome!

00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:19.600
I knew I'd get my chance
to see all five Utopias

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.570
if I just hung in there!

00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:27.508
And that's why
I'll never give up.

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.709
Hope you're ready for me!

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:32.378
Because I'm feelin' the flow!

00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:36.015
Can Yuma actually defeat
all five Utopias?

00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:36.616
No, he can't.

00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:40.319
That's right, only a Number
can destroy a Number.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.453
And Yuma has none.

00:04:41.453 --> 00:04:43.722
But he doesn't
look stressed out.

00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:46.325
No he doesn't, Caswell.

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:46.725
Go Yuma!

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.328
You've overcome bigger hurdles
than this before!

00:04:50.328 --> 00:04:52.730
Yeah! Thanks, Tori!

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.732
Here goes!
My turn! I draw!

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:58.436
Yuma, if you fail
to conquer this challenge,

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:01.638
there is no hope
for your future.

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:06.710
Ready, Astral?

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.012
I activate XYZ Treasure!

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:13.048
I draw one card for
each of your Utopias!

00:05:13.048 --> 00:05:16.652
So I draw five cards!

00:05:16.652 --> 00:05:17.086
Haa!

00:05:17.086 --> 00:05:21.623
Next, I summon Gagaga Mancer.

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:25.360
Gagaga Mancer can wield
its magical staff

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.729
to resurrect
another Gagaga monster

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.098
back from the graveyard.

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.536
Welcome home, Gagaga Magician!

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.705
You will now overlay
those two, typical.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.673
Nuh-uh,
you thought wrong!

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:44.644
I activate Gagagamirage!

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.711
With this trap card,

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:50.715
one Gagaga monster counts
as two when I XYZ Summon.

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:53.718
Since I have
two Gagaga monsters,

00:05:53.718 --> 00:05:55.320
it's double the fun.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.155
I can XYZ Summon twice!

00:05:57.155 --> 00:06:00.125
First, I overlay
two Gagaga Mancers

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.493
to build the Overlay Network!

00:06:05.396 --> 00:06:07.498
I Xyz Summon!

00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:11.000
Round 'em up, Gagaga Cowboy.

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:15.405
And next,

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:20.009
I overlay my two
Gagaga Magicians.

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.109
I Xyz Summon

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:25.714
the noble warrior
Gagaga Samurai!

00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:32.653
East meets West
to form the perfect team.

00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:35.523
Gagaga Samurai uses
one Overlay Unit

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:39.727
to allow
each of my monsters
to attack twice!

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:44.164
Two times two equals
a total of four attacks

00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:46.600
that'll be heading your way.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:50.136
Gagaga Cowboy also
uses one Overlay Unit

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:52.705
to lasso up 1000 attack points!

00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.707
And when it battles
your monster...

00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:56.709
I am quite aware
that my monster

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:58.344
will lose 500 attack points

00:06:58.344 --> 00:07:01.347
so I have already prepared
for that contingency.

00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:03.681
Utopia Beyond's special ability

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.951
makes my monsters
immune to yours.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.289
So your Cowboy does not have
enough attack points to win.

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.724
You're wrong about that,
partner.

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.658
Partner?

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:18.695
I activate Gagaga Mancer's
special ability!

00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:20.330
I banish it from the graveyard

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.034
to give Gagaga Cowboy
500 more attack points!

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:29.705
His Cowboy is now
the strongest monster
on the field!

00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:32.707
Attack Utopia Ray!

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:38.179
Yuma's on fire!

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:40.715
He destroyed a Number
without a Number!

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.616
My Cowboy's not done.

00:07:42.616 --> 00:07:46.720
Stampede all over Utopia Ray V!

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:53.026
Yuma managed
to destroy
two Numbers!

00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:55.628
I'll admit
that's quite impressive.

00:07:55.628 --> 00:07:58.631
Since Utopia Ray
and Utopia Ray V

00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:00.066
lost their special abilities,

00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:01.701
they could be destroyed even by

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:05.304
monsters that weren't Numbers.

00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:06.338
Not too shabby.

00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:09.174
But let's see if he can
keep the momentum.

00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:10.442
Though well executed,

00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:13.344
your strategy was only
a momentary setback.

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:16.347
Gagaga Cowboy can
no longer attack.

00:08:16.347 --> 00:08:19.083
You are all
out of options, Yuma.

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:19.717
'Fraid not!

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:23.186
I've already got
my next move planned out.

00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:23.687
You do?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.692
I play the spell
Gagaga Mirror Slash!

00:08:28.692 --> 00:08:32.696
My monster transforms into
one of your monsters!

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.497
Except my monster will
be better than yours

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:38.400
because it can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.468
And you know what else?

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:40.703
When your monster is destroyed,

00:08:40.936 --> 00:08:44.505
you take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:45.440
Oh, no!

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.443
Let's go, Gagaga Samurai!

00:08:48.443 --> 00:08:51.245
Attack Utopia Beyond.

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:53.914
Transform!

00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:56.650
Seeing double yet?

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.354
Rising Sun Beyond Slash!

00:09:03.357 --> 00:09:07.693
You now take damage equal to
Utopia Beyond's attack points

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:11.130
for 3000 points of damage!

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.432
Ready for more?

00:09:14.432 --> 00:09:18.703
Because my monster can
attack you once again!

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.475
This time, transform
into Utopia Ray Victory!

00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:25.676
It's the moment of truth,
fellas.

00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:29.079
If this attack succeeds,
Yuma will win the duel!

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:31.482
You got this in the bag, Yuma!

00:09:32.683 --> 00:09:36.519
I activate the spell
Heat &amp; Heal!

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:39.322
I regain life points
equal to the Number

00:09:39.322 --> 00:09:42.458
with the lowest Rank,
so Utopia infuses me

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.627
with 2500 life points.

00:09:46.228 --> 00:09:50.298
Utopia Ray Victory, attack!

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:58.339
There can be only one winner,
and it's gonna be me!

00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:00.708
Whoa!

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.581
Astral?

00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:11.284
I am not yet defeated, Yuma.

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:15.421
Heat &amp; Heal becomes
Utopia's Overlay Unit.

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:19.591
I now realize
how careless
I have been.

00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.429
I should have paid more
attention to your earlier words.

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:26.631
I knew I'd get my chance
to see all five Utopias

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:29.033
if I just hung in there!

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:30.701
"See all five."

00:10:30.701 --> 00:10:31.602
You clearly verbalized

00:10:31.602 --> 00:10:35.338
that you knew I would
summon all five Utopias.

00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:36.673
You got me.

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:39.676
That is why you had
a strategy ready

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:42.045
to counteract them.

00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:43.380
Yeah, that was the plan.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.282
It was taking forever
to build the right deck.

00:10:46.282 --> 00:10:49.218
My brain hurt.
Then it hit me.

00:10:49.218 --> 00:10:50.686
In all our duels together,

00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:54.423
you always told me to figure out
what my opponent's thinking

00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:57.692
so that I'd have
a strategy to fight back.

00:10:57.692 --> 00:10:59.494
So that's what I did.

00:10:59.494 --> 00:11:01.196
And maybe, just maybe,

00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:04.032
if I can understand
what you're thinking,

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.933
I can find a way
to change your mind

00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:08.602
so that you'll abandon
your mission.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.671
My odds might be
a million to one.

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:14.675
It could be a bazillion
trillion shabillion to one!

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:17.143
But that doesn't matter to me.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.478
What does matter
is that as long as

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:21.547
there's a slim chance that
you'll see things my way,

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.617
then I'm going
to take those odds!

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.251
Because I'm not giving up,

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.055
and I'm not giving up on you!

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.393
You expect me
to change my mind?

00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:36.694
How foolish.

00:11:36.694 --> 00:11:37.995
I will never allow you

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:40.331
to walk away victorious, Yuma.

00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:44.335
For I will defend Astral World!

00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:45.569
Defend Astral World?

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:47.670
Any clue what
he's talking about?

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.439
Beats me, something's up.

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:51.541
(Quinton)
And I think
I know what.

00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:52.675
Huh?

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:54.144
This is no friendly duel.

00:11:54.144 --> 00:11:56.945
If it's true that Astral
is still battling

00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.515
for the survival
of his homeworld,

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:02.484
he intends to destroy
Barian World.

00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:03.385
No way!

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:05.154
Yuma will not
let Astral do that.

00:12:05.154 --> 00:12:08.289
That's precisely why
Yuma is dueling Astral.

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.491
I can't imagine
the emotional toll

00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.692
it's taking on him.

00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:15.029
Astral, I place
three cards facedown

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:16.463
and end my turn.

00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:18.098
That means Gagaga Cowboy's

00:12:18.098 --> 00:12:21.101
attack points return to normal.

00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:22.669
Now, it's my turn!

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:24.604
I draw!

00:12:24.604 --> 00:12:26.039
Bring it on!

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:27.506
Take your best shot!

00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:28.941
As you wish.

00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:33.112
Utopia, attack Gagaga Cowboy!

00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:38.683
I activate my Half Unbreak!

00:12:38.683 --> 00:12:41.686
It stops Utopia from
destroying my monster,

00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:45.089
and it also cuts
the damage I take
in half!

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:47.558
That is pointless
because I activate

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.560
the trap card Absolute Buster.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.963
It removes Gagaga Cowboy's
protective barrier,

00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:56.200
so it can once again
be destroyed!

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.667
This isn't good!

00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:00.670
Rising Sun Slash!

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.680
Oh, no!

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.984
Yuma, you have improved
much as a duelist,

00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:18.485
but your skills are
nowhere near mine.

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:22.022
I will always be
ten steps ahead of you.

00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:25.659
You thought you knew
my strategies,

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:27.461
but you never did.

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.063
You shall not
survive much longer

00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:32.398
against my Utopia.

00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:34.300
(thinking):
Utopia.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.403
You were the very first
Xyz Monster I summoned.

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:40.405
I'll never forget
that day because

00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:44.109
it was the moment that
changed my life forever.

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:45.677
When things got rough,

00:13:45.677 --> 00:13:48.145
you were there to pull me
out of the fire.

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:50.448
I knew I'd always
have a shot to win

00:13:50.448 --> 00:13:52.216
as long as you were by my side.

00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:54.218
But now you're not by my side.

00:13:54.218 --> 00:13:56.387
I have to fight you!

00:13:56.387 --> 00:13:59.155
I have to defeat
you and Astral.

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:02.392
It just feels
all kinds of wrong.

00:14:02.392 --> 00:14:06.529
But I've got no choice
but to keep dueling!

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:08.264
I draw!

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:12.167
I activate the spell
Gagaga Revenge!

00:14:12.534 --> 00:14:14.670
This card resurrects
a Gagaga monster

00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:17.039
from my graveyard!

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:21.142
Get back on your saddle,
Gagaga Cowboy!

00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:25.013
Time for a showdown.

00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:26.681
Here I go.

00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:31.385
Gagaga Cowboy, attack Utopia!

00:14:31.385 --> 00:14:33.186
But why?!

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.657
What gives?!

00:14:36.657 --> 00:14:38.659
Why's he attacking
with Gagaga Cowboy

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:40.893
when Utopia has
more attack points?!

00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:43.663
The stress must've
gotten to Yuma because

00:14:43.663 --> 00:14:45.931
this attack is nuts.

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:49.668
Utopia has 1000
more attack points

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:51.603
than Gagaga Cowboy.

00:14:51.603 --> 00:14:53.204
Since Yuma only has

00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:54.572
900 life points,

00:14:54.572 --> 00:14:57.309
he will lose, so why...

00:14:57.309 --> 00:14:58.677
(gasps)

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:04.348
He has some other strategy
in store for me.

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:08.952
I activate Utopia's
special ability!

00:15:08.952 --> 00:15:11.120
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.390
it stops your
Gagaga Cowboy's attack!

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:18.928
Light Wing Shield!

00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:27.135
Your attack did
not succeed, Yuma.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.670
You're right about that.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.670
Just as I planned.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.671
What did you say?

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:35.609
I play the Trap
Light Wing Bumper!

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:37.645
Since Utopia stopped my attack,

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.646
it loses all its
special abilities

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:43.383
and 800 attack points.

00:15:43.383 --> 00:15:44.951
So I would have won

00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:47.253
if I did not stop your attack.

00:15:47.253 --> 00:15:48.655
You outplayed me.

00:15:48.655 --> 00:15:50.055
Yeah, it was totally risky

00:15:50.055 --> 00:15:52.658
but a risk that
I was willing to take!

00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:55.427
Now Gagaga Samurai!

00:15:55.427 --> 00:15:58.664
Destroy Utopia!

00:16:07.972 --> 00:16:10.074
Gagaga Samurai!

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:12.642
Destroy Utopia!

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:21.484
Aww, yeah!

00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:24.286
That was impressive.

00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:25.221
Truly.

00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:26.555
Only a courageous fool

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:30.126
would launch such a
self-destructive maneuver.

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:34.662
But I expected nothing less.

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:37.966
(laughter)
Yuma destroyed
all five Utopias!

00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:39.200
He's the cat's meow!

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.668
Man, I haven't had
a duel this fun

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.337
in the longest time.

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:44.938
I just wish that's...

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:46.607
all we were dueling for.

00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:49.643
Barian World is
the enemy of Astral World.

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:51.477
It must be extinguished.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:53.646
It ain't fair, Astral.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:55.648
It's like
every single time I duel,

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.418
the fate of the galaxy
is at stake.

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.052
And look what it cost me.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.654
I had to say goodbye
to Shark, Kite,

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.589
some of my closest friends!

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.625
I was never gonna
pick up my deck again

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:09.060
until you said
your dumb mission
wasn't over

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.529
and dragged me into this duel!

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:15.132
Why do I always have to duel
with something on the line?

00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:19.470
But was this not the only way

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.638
I could force you
to duel again?

00:17:21.871 --> 00:17:23.139
Huh?

00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:25.608
Yuma, you have
always maintained

00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:27.076
that all problems can be solved

00:17:27.076 --> 00:17:28.945
through dueling,
so let me see you try!

00:17:28.945 --> 00:17:32.648
I activate
Rank-Down-Magic
Utopia Fall!

00:17:32.648 --> 00:17:34.650
Rank down instead of up?

00:17:34.883 --> 00:17:36.051
That is correct!

00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:38.587
I rebuild the Overlay Network.

00:17:38.587 --> 00:17:39.655
I overlay Utopia

00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:43.658
to Xyz Summon a monster
with a lower Rank.

00:17:43.658 --> 00:17:46.661
Xyz De-Evolution!

00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:51.932
Come on out,

00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:55.969
Number 39:
Utopia Roots!

00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:04.643
Utopia Roots?!

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:07.046
Why did you rank down?

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:09.648
You must've really
wanted that monster.

00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:14.652
I place one card face down
and end my turn!

00:18:15.987 --> 00:18:17.489
My turn!

00:18:17.489 --> 00:18:18.323
I draw!

00:18:18.323 --> 00:18:22.026
I activate the spell
Number Fortification!

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:23.627
It equips on to Utopia Roots

00:18:23.861 --> 00:18:27.631
and provides it with
1500 attack points.

00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:31.268
Furthermore, two of my Numbers

00:18:31.268 --> 00:18:34.403
transform into Overlay Units!

00:18:34.403 --> 00:18:37.640
I choose Shark Drake.

00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:43.545
And Galaxy-Eyes
Prime Photon Dragon!

00:18:44.346 --> 00:18:47.883
I know you remember
these two Numbers.

00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:50.652
Those were Shark's and Kite's!

00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:52.087
Why did he pick those?

00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:54.955
(thinking):
Yuma, these monsters
must remind you

00:18:54.955 --> 00:18:57.525
of your duels against
Shark and Kite.

00:18:57.525 --> 00:18:59.093
Of how your formidable enemies

00:18:59.093 --> 00:19:01.629
became your
irreplaceable friends.

00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:04.264
I cannot help
but to conclude that

00:19:04.264 --> 00:19:06.299
as your duels
became more intense

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:08.134
and infinitely dangerous,

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:10.103
you were no longer
dueling to duel,

00:19:10.103 --> 00:19:12.639
you were dueling to survive.

00:19:12.639 --> 00:19:15.641
In the process,
you have lost something

00:19:15.641 --> 00:19:17.142
that you cannot,

00:19:17.142 --> 00:19:19.378
must not live without.

00:19:19.378 --> 00:19:22.648
I hope this duel
reminds you what that is.

00:19:22.648 --> 00:19:24.649
Attack, Utopia Roots!

00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:28.185
Destroy Gagaga Cowboy!

00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:29.620
No! I won't let you!

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.023
Come on, Gagaga Samurai!

00:19:32.023 --> 00:19:33.623
By switching to defense mode,

00:19:33.623 --> 00:19:35.892
my Samurai forces Utopia Roots

00:19:35.892 --> 00:19:39.629
to attack it instead
of Gagaga Cowboy!

00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:44.967
I activate the trap
Rank Revolution!

00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:47.303
It negates
the special abilities

00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:48.404
of all Xyz Monsters

00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:51.974
with equal or higher Rank
than Utopia Roots.

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:54.475
Since Gagaga Samurai's
Rank is higher,

00:19:54.475 --> 00:19:58.947
it can no longer
protect your Gagaga Cowboy!

00:20:01.482 --> 00:20:04.618
Rising Sun Roots Slash!

00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:12.426
Aah!

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:16.596
Aah!

00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:17.597
I am not done.

00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:20.933
I follow it up with
the trap Overlay Accel!

00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:22.535
Since my Xyz Monster

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:25.070
destroyed your monster
in battle,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.205
it can use one Overlay Unit

00:20:27.205 --> 00:20:29.107
to attack you again.

00:20:31.368 --> 00:20:32.336
No way!

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:35.605
Utopia Roots has
three Overlay Units.

00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:36.139
This is bad.

00:20:36.139 --> 00:20:39.343
That means it can attack Yuma
over and over again!

00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:44.715
I use one of Utopia Roots's
Overlay Units to attack!

00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:51.588
Destroy Gagaga Samurai!

00:21:00.097 --> 00:21:01.131
Aah!

00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:03.734
I hoped to remind you
of what you have lost,

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:08.004
but the way you are dueling,
it was not meant to be.

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:11.108
(thinking):
What I lost?

00:21:16.213 --> 00:21:18.715
What did I lose?
