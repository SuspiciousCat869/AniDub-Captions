WEBVTT

00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.436
(Mr. Heartland)
We're down to our
final four duelists

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.603
as the World Duel Carnival nears
its thrilling conclusion!

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:10.536
But first, we'll unveil the
stadium's latest upgrade!

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.436
Now elevate the Duel Tower!

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.436
(cheering)

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.003
Hope you're not scared
of heights,

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.303
'cause you're about to witness

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:45.469
some of the dizziest dueling
action ever

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.869
as Shark battles Yuma and Kite
confronts Vetrix!

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:51.136
Yuma's gotta
take on Shark!?

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:52.969
He's dueled against
Shark before,

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.269
so it could give him a big
advantage in this round.

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:57.769
Yuma knows all about
Shark's cards and moves.

00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:00.936
Now he can use that knowledge
to plan out his strategy!

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.403
But Shark knows the same things
about Yuma, too.

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:06.103
Besides we all know Yuma
never plans his strategy,

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:08.569
'cause then he'd have to
use his brain.

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:11.569
(Tori)
It's true that Yuma has dueled
Shark many times in the past,

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:13.103
but he never had
to battle a monster

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:16.136
like the one Shark used
against Quattro.

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:18.703
Appear, Chaos Number 32!

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:20.269
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.103
I hope Yuma
will be okay.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:34.603
The opening duel of the
semifinal round will begin now!

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.369
Our first duelist was unknown

00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:38.236
when he took the World Duel
Carnival by storm

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:40.569
in a series of
spectacular victories.

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:42.669
He may look like a pint-sized
pipsqueak,

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.669
but this kid has
the heart of a giant!

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:47.903
Give it up for
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.803
(Yuma)
I won't let you guys down!

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:55.869
(Mr. Heartland)
The last time we saw Yuma's
challenger in the spotlight,

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:58.903
he was banished from the dueling
world in disgrace,

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:01.303
but now he's back
with a vengeance!

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:04.736
No opponent is safe when this
"Shark" zeroes in on his prey!

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:06.903
It's Reginald Kastle!

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.603
What's up with Shark?

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:12.069
He looks strange.

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:14.769
Hey, Shark,
is everything okay?

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.036
He didn't react.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.269
Something's
gotta be wrong.

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:23.536
Before you start dueling, let's
add a little altitude!

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.136
Only one of these
rivals will advance!

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.236
Will the winner be Yuma
the dueling wonder kid,

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.369
or will Shark
complete his comeback?

00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:41.269
Our two duelists know they have
to lay it all on the line!

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:44.569
Are you ready to see the
most epic duel ever waged!?

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:45.736
Yeah!

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.669

(Yuma)
Shark looks
totally spaced out!

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:02.003
Kind of like I get
in math class.

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:04.136
It is possible Shark
has become possessed.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:08.469
As you surely remember, Shark
summoned out a Chaos Number

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:10.403
during his
battle with Quattro.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.236
The darkness within
that Number

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.269
was too much
for Shark to control.

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:17.503
I believe it has overpowered
him completely now.

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:19.669
You mean it's like
it zombified him?

00:04:19.703 --> 00:04:20.903
Poor Shark!

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:22.469
(Vetrix)
Shark versus Yuma!

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:24.503
What an entertaining matchup!

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:27.769
It should be a nail biter
with these two.

00:04:27.803 --> 00:04:30.869
Yes, even if I already know who
the winner is going to be!

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:36.603
Snap out of it, Shark!

00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:39.569
Fight that Number,
don't let it take over!

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.769
Yuma, this duel
will be challenging.

00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:45.636
If that Number does
control Shark,

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.969
then his dueling abilities

00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:49.503
will be even sharper
than they normally are.

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:51.503
You must stay alert!

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:52.636
Don't worry!

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.903
I'll help Shark
and rule this duel!

00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:57.903
Let's go!

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:01.269
Yeah!

00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:03.103
Duel Disk go!

00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:07.836
Duel Gazer,
let's roll!

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:11.869
Get set to get decked!

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:14.369
<i>(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.</i>

00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:18.769
Let's duel!

00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:21.003
I guess I'll get
things rolling!

00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:22.003
I draw!

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:25.736
First, I'll place a monster
in defense mode.

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:32.169
And next I'll play a second
card facedown ending my turn.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:33.336
Perfect.

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:36.836
The first card Yuma put down
is Dododo Bot.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.169
It has 1900 defense points.

00:05:39.203 --> 00:05:42.236
The other card is the trap
Impenetrable attack.

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:46.269
He has put himself in a strong
position to survive an attack.

00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:48.536
Take it away, you're up.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:49.936
It's my turn.

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:55.403
To start, I summon
my Spear Shark.

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.703
Only 1600 attack points.

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:04.069
It's harmless.

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:05.236
Are you sure?

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.003
Do not underestimate
Shark's tactics.

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:11.369
Spear Shark attack Yuma's
facedown monster.

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:12.969
Why would he make
such a reckless attack

00:06:13.003 --> 00:06:15.069
on a facedown card?

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.603
It could be much stronger
than his own monster.

00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:28.836
Shark!

00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:37.036
I do not understand.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.236
To attack
without knowing

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:40.569
the opposing card's
strength is foolish.

00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:43.436
Whoa, that move is costing
Reginald big time!

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.103
He got careless

00:06:45.136 --> 00:06:48.703
and now he's down for the count
instead of Yuma.

00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:50.836
Shark made
a rookie mistake!

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.503
I only expected something that
pathetic to be done by Yuma.

00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:57.303
Maybe this is all part of
Shark's game plan.

00:06:57.336 --> 00:06:58.936
Think about it.

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.769
Yuma knows Shark's
usual strategies

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:02.403
inside and out, right?

00:07:02.436 --> 00:07:04.536
So what if Shark decided
to change things up

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.703
'cause he figured that
would confuse Yuma?

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:09.136
You're sayin' Shark took
that damage on purpose?

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.236
Now, Yuma I will place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:19.769
Man!

00:07:19.803 --> 00:07:23.369
Shark's totally not acting
like himself this duel.

00:07:23.403 --> 00:07:26.369
You have no way of knowing what
is going through his mind.

00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:28.736
I believe the wisest course
is to keep your guard up

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:30.703
and stay prepared
for surprises.

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:33.136
And you must not
grow overconfident.

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.369
I'm too good to
let that happen.

00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:36.536
Watch out!

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.003
It's my turn to draw!

00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:41.469
I summon Gogogo Golem!

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.003
Now, I switch Dododo Bot
to attack mode!

00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:56.536
Okay, get moving,
Gogogo Golem!

00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:58.036
Blast Spear Shark!

00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:09.636
Shark!

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:17.736
He's still under the control
of that Number.

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.369
I'll have to shock him
back to his senses.

00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:22.836
Get set, Dododo Bot!

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.669
Discharge your
Lightning Blade!

00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:35.169
(Mr. Heartland)
Whoa, talk about
electrifying!

00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:38.536
That jolt just cost Shark
1800 life points!

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:40.336
If he doesn't rise soon,

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:43.103
he'll have to forfeit the duel
completely!

00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:44.869
Get up, Shark!

00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:47.103
You've gotta gut this duel
out to the end!

00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.201
(audience)
Shark, Shark, Shark...

00:08:58.001 --> 00:08:58.901
What's wrong?

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:00.934
I know Shark
isn't a quitter!

00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:05.134
Don't give up now, Shark.

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:07.001
Keep on battling.

00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:09.267
You're the fiercest duelist
I ever met.

00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.501
Nobody's tougher than you!

00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:13.734
You're supposed to duel
like a shark.

00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:15.767
I've seen guppies
with more fight.

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.934
I won't attack
him when he's down.

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:28.001
I'm putting a card facedown
and ending my turn!

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:32.767
Aren't you at
least gonna try!?

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:35.034
Yeah, that's right,
c'mon, Shark.

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:36.501
Get up an' duel!

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.001
(Shark)
Yes, I must duel.

00:09:39.034 --> 00:09:44.267
That's why I'm here,
but what am I fighting for?

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:48.834
I know there's a reason, but I
can't remember what it is.

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:50.967
Try to remember.

00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:53.634
What's my reason
for dueling?

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:55.367
(Vetrix)
Have you really forgotten?

00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.901
Vetrix!

00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:00.234
You know who I am!

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:01.734
That's very good, Shark.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.234
I'm relieved
that your memory

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:05.734
has not been completely
wiped out.

00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:08.534
Together we can rebuild
what has been lost.

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:12.567
If you trust me, I can
help you remember everything.

00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:13.734
Listen.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:16.201
I know the reason
that you duel.

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:17.834
It is simple.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.167
You duel for me.For you?

00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:21.701
Exactly.

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.567
That is your whole purpose.

00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:26.834
You are my puppet
and you obey my commands.

00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:31.767
And now I command you to
completely destroy your enemy!

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.967
My enemy must be
destroyed completely.

00:10:45.934 --> 00:10:46.967
Shark!

00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:56.134
Shark, what's wrong!?

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.967
(Mr. Heartland)
Uh-oh, Shark's having
a massive meltdown!

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.634
The pressure of
competing on the big stage

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.534
must be getting to him.

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.167
(Vetrix)
What's the problem, Shark?

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:06.301
I've told you what
you have to do.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:08.801
So why are you
resisting my commands?

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:09.867
I told you before.

00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:11.767
I planted a dark seed
in your heart.

00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.901
Use it to destroy your enemies.

00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:16.467
Let me remind you of who
your enemies are

00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:18.801
and why you detest them.

00:11:18.834 --> 00:11:22.701
Think back on your own sister
and what they did to her.

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:25.534
You must get revenge
on those responsible.

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.301
(Shark)
Rio!

00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:31.367
I know him!

00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:33.534
That's Quattro!

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:39.667
And Vetrix, too!?

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.367
Could they be my enemies?

00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:46.634
Who is that?

00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:50.067
(Vetrix)
It's Dr. Faker.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:57.567
Faker... I feel like I've heard
that name before.

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:08.934
Dr. Faker.

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:12.434
His name should fill your heart
with rage, of course.

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:16.201
You see, he's the one who
injured your little sister.

00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:19.801
You vowed that you would make
him pay for his terrible crime

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:23.134
and that you wouldn't let
anyone stand in your way.

00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:25.901
Yes, of course,
Dr. Faker.

00:12:25.934 --> 00:12:28.167
He's the one who
hurt my little sister.

00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:29.967
Dr. Faker is my enemy.

00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:32.567
I'll do whatever it takes
to destroy him!

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:35.534
It's true.

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:38.367
You must destroy
Dr. Faker.

00:12:38.401 --> 00:12:40.301
But that's
not possible, Shark.

00:12:40.334 --> 00:12:43.201
Because there's someone else
standing in your way.

00:12:43.234 --> 00:12:45.001
But who do you mean?

00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:47.767
You've forgotten
his identity, too?

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.401
Let me jog your memory.

00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:57.167
That's Yuma Tsukumo.

00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:58.267
Yes!

00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.367
Surely you remember
how ruthless Yuma can be!

00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:04.967
He's always meddling in your
plans and sabotaging them!

00:13:08.134 --> 00:13:11.134
Even now Yuma is
standing in your way.

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:14.534
He's trying to defeat you
for Dr. Faker

00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:17.534
just as he teamed
up with Faker before

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:20.001
to strike down your
sister, Rio!

00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:24.567
Shark!

00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:28.601
I'll never forgive you!

00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:36.806
Let's settle this once
and for all, Yuma!

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:40.972
That crest on his hand.

00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:42.572
We've seen it before.

00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:43.972
You are correct.

00:13:44.006 --> 00:13:47.239
It is the same crest that
belongs to Vetrix.

00:13:47.272 --> 00:13:49.672
Then Shark isn't
possessed by a Number.

00:13:49.706 --> 00:13:51.572
He's possessed by Vetrix!

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:53.306
(Vetrix)
You almost have it right.

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:57.339
To be precise, Shark's soul has
been taken over by a Number.

00:13:57.372 --> 00:13:59.706
But it is controlled
by yours truly.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:03.006
Because of this
I also control Shark now!

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:04.472
He is my puppet.

00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:08.439
And I will use this puppet
to destroy you, Yuma!

00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:09.872
Get ready!

00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:12.772
Here it comes, Yuma!

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:14.939
I summon my
Double Shark!

00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:20.039
Next I'll give my Shark
some extra bite

00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:22.639
by using my
Aqua jet spell card!

00:14:22.672 --> 00:14:24.039
It gains a thousand
attack points

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.406
till the end of this turn.

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:27.639
Okay, Double Shark,
it's chow time!

00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:30.072
Polish off
Gogogo Golem now!

00:14:31.172 --> 00:14:33.039
Yuma, launch a defense!

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.372
I'll use a trap!

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.806
Impenetrable attack!

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:40.706
It protects Gogogo Golem
from destruction!

00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:43.606
It's no use, 'cause I can
neutralize your trap card

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.972
with my spell
card Shark Spark!

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.539
So your Gogogo Golem
is a goner!

00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:52.072
No way!

00:14:56.672 --> 00:14:59.739
Good work, Double Shark,
now finish your attack!

00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:10.406
Yuma!

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:12.039
You're not out of danger!

00:15:12.072 --> 00:15:14.439
Double Shark can
double-up its attack!

00:15:14.472 --> 00:15:15.939
Get Dododo Bot!

00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:27.972
For a second there
it really looked

00:15:28.006 --> 00:15:29.872
like Shark was
throwing in the towel,

00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:32.372
but now he's going
on the attack!

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.672
That's what I call
showing real heart!

00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:36.572
Way to go!

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:38.306
It's a total turnaround!

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:39.872
I wonder what woke him up?

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:41.639
Maybe he was
faking it before.

00:15:41.672 --> 00:15:44.006
I'm not finished yet, Yuma!

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.972
It's payback day!

00:15:46.006 --> 00:15:49.172
I'll start by activating
my spell Upswell!

00:15:49.206 --> 00:15:52.072
Since I just destroyed one
of your monsters in battle.

00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:54.339
I can use this spell
to summon Spear Shark

00:15:54.372 --> 00:15:56.106
back from my graveyard!

00:15:56.139 --> 00:16:00.006
I just have to lower its attack
points by one thousand.

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:02.306
Spear Shark,
prepare to attack!

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:08.306
I'm going to get revenge
for my sister, Rio!

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.339
Spear Shark,
attack Yuma directly!

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:20.372
Oh, Yuma!

00:16:20.406 --> 00:16:23.172
Well, at least he's dueling
like his normal self again.

00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:25.339
Shark is far from normal.

00:16:25.372 --> 00:16:26.572
It is clear that Vetrix

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:29.439
has intensified his control
of Shark's mind.

00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.539
The rage that is
growing inside Shark

00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:33.939
makes him a much more
dangerous opponent.

00:16:33.972 --> 00:16:35.472
He's angry.

00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:37.572
But why is he angry at me?

00:16:37.606 --> 00:16:39.739
I'll never forgive you!

00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:42.306
I'm going to get revenge
for my sister, Rio!

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.639
He thinks I hurt her.

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:46.039
It's Vetrix.

00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:47.772
He changed Shark's memories!

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:49.006
He has.

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:51.439
By making Shark believe you
harmed his sister,

00:16:51.472 --> 00:16:53.272
Vetrix unleashed
Shark's anger.

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:56.139
I'll finish you off
on my next turn, Yuma!

00:16:57.872 --> 00:16:59.272
But since I'm done for now,

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.806
Double Shark is back down
to 1200 attack points.

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.206
Magnificent!

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:07.039
Two monsters destroyed plus
a direct attack on Yuma

00:17:07.072 --> 00:17:09.139
and he did it all
in a single turn.

00:17:09.172 --> 00:17:12.106
Shark has become a ruthless
dueling machine!

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:16.706
After this duel, I can unleash
him on my archenemy, Dr. Faker!

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.002
I've gotta find a way
to help Shark!

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.502
But how can I stop Vetrix
from controlling him?

00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:28.202
The problem is
not just Vetrix.

00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:30.436
A Number is possessing
Shark, too.

00:17:30.469 --> 00:17:32.969
And that Number can
evolve into a Chaos Number,

00:17:33.002 --> 00:17:34.202
Shark Drake Veiss.

00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.569
If Shark summons the Number

00:17:35.602 --> 00:17:38.102
before you break Vetrix'
grip on his mind,

00:17:38.136 --> 00:17:40.669
then it will be almost
impossible to save Shark!

00:17:40.702 --> 00:17:42.069
It's not gonna happen.

00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:44.469
I'll do whatever it
takes to win this duel.

00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:47.569
Hopefully that will restore
Shark back to his normal self.

00:17:47.602 --> 00:17:49.936
(audience)
Yuma, Yuma, Yuma...

00:17:52.436 --> 00:17:53.636
Yuma!

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:56.136
It's my turn,
I draw!

00:17:56.169 --> 00:17:59.736
I'm gonna scare up Gogogo
Ghost in attack mode!

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:12.202
All right, Gogogo Ghost!

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:14.902
Slam Spear Shark
with Fear Strike!

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:16.836
I don't think so!

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.536
I'm activating a trap.

00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:20.036
Zeus' breath!

00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:22.402
You can't overpower
the mighty Zeus!

00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:24.536
It easily blocks
your monster's attack

00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:27.469
and since I have a Water
Attribute monster on my field,

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:30.469
this trap blasts you with
800 points of damage!

00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:35.069
Yuma got hit again!

00:18:35.102 --> 00:18:37.536
If this keeps up,
he'll be a goner!

00:18:37.569 --> 00:18:40.136
I thought Yuma had this won,
but now it's all Shark!

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:43.002
Yeah, but Yuma still
has more life points.

00:18:43.036 --> 00:18:45.636
And I bet he's gonna need
every last one of 'em!

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:49.636
My move-- I'm placing
one card facedown.

00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:51.802
And ending my turn.

00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:53.669
You're up!

00:18:53.702 --> 00:18:56.769
And you're
going down, Yuma.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.702
I have a card that's gonna
finish you off forever.

00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:03.002
I'll get revenge
for what you did to Rio!

00:19:03.036 --> 00:19:04.269
You've got it wrong.

00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:06.036
Vetrix is tricking you.

00:19:06.069 --> 00:19:09.002
What happened to your
sister is his fault.

00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:10.502
I don't believe you.

00:19:10.536 --> 00:19:13.502
We both know you'd say
anything to save yourself.

00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:14.969
But it's too late, Yuma!

00:19:15.002 --> 00:19:16.402
It's ending now!

00:19:16.436 --> 00:19:19.336
You're guilty and this
is your judgment day!

00:19:19.369 --> 00:19:22.202
I'll finish you off
when I use my Number!

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.802
Number!?

00:19:23.836 --> 00:19:26.636
Of course, Shark only
needs one more monster

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:28.502
to build
the Overlay Network.

00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:31.169
At last!

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:35.202
I summon Shocktopus
to my field in attack mode!

00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:43.202
Now everything is set.

00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:45.369
I'll overlay my Level 4
Shocktopus,

00:19:45.402 --> 00:19:48.302
along with my
Double Shark and Spear Shark!

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:55.102
With these three monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:19:58.702 --> 00:20:02.569
I Xyz Summon Number 32:
Shark Drake!

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:17.902
This is bad, Yuma.

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:21.969
Perfect!

00:20:22.002 --> 00:20:23.702
I'm very pleased
with you, Shark.

00:20:23.736 --> 00:20:25.069
Now unleash your Number

00:20:25.102 --> 00:20:28.102
and stomp out that pest
once and for all!
