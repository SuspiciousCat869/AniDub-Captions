00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:05.339

Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.507
Dumon.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.375
Yes,
Mizar.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:12.980
Girag and Alito have made no
progress in collecting Numbers.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.215
Their failures
mandate that I send you

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.451
to see that
we succeed.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.419
Take these
with you.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.655
Baria
Sphere Cubes.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.392
These will allow you to
create a temporary Sphere Field.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.829
We can take on Yuma Tsukumo
and retrieve the Numbers

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.198
using our own
devastating might.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:35.769
I will not
fail you!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.773

Barian Sphere Field!

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.644
What's
going on?

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:46.113
This cannot
be good!

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.314
Who
are you?

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.650
My name
is Mizar.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.218
Remember
me well,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:55.122
for I am the last
duelist you will ever face!

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.657
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:56.657 --> 00:01:01.995
I equip Overlay
Chain onto Utopia!

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.730
And with it,
Utopia's Overlay Units

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.432
will be wrapped
up good and tight

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.602
so you can't
take them.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.239
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon a monster

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.575
stronger than
a Cosmic Storm!

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.445

to bend time to do its will.

What's that about?

I thought there
were only 100 Numbers?

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.061
Correct.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.329
My missing

confused...

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.437
Number 107
should not exist!

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.940

your Number makes

I don't
think so, Mizar!

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:31.745
I use one Overlay Unit to
negate your monster's attack!

Thanks!

You think that's
going to keep you safe?

What do you
mean, Mizar?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.332
You can't
attack me anymore!

I disagree!

Tachyon Dragon gains
1,000 attack points!

This does not bode
well for us, so listen.

We must double our efforts
