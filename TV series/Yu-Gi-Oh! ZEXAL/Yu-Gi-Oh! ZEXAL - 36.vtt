WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.260
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.060
Duelist A: Hey!

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.130
Cameron CLIX: Some say photos
bring back memories of the past.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.660
Mine do the opposite.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.230
They bring forth the future.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.530
kari: Look for the last time
yuma, do you know him or not?

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.190
his name is Cameron
clix, ring any bells?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.290
YUMA: No...

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.490
no bells.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.990
And he's big
into taking pictures.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.430
I just know he's competing
in the duel carnival.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.060
He's dangerous yuma, and
someone needs to stop him.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.860
Hey, wait up!

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.330
You've hurt a lot
of people, Cameron.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.990
I want to know why!

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.730
It's quite simple.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.730
I do it to acquire
number cards.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.890
Enough people have been
hurt by your dark ways.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.990
It ends now!

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.760
Think about this
like a journalist.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.530
After all, it could make
for a pretty good scoop.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.160
Take this snapshot
I took earlier.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.960
It's real headline news.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.660
Tori!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.130
Oh, do you know her?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.860
Such a shame what happened.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.490
Or what's about to.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.160
I know statistically they say
flying is the safest way to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.690
travel, but that's
not True today.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.190
And for Tori,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.590
I'm afraid that's some
seriously bad news indeed.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.290
I'll figure out how
to save the airship.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.730
You keep an eye on Cameron!

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.990
Alright, let's do this Cameron!

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.030
Let's duel!

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.530
Hey, what are you doing?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230
I'm taking your photo.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.690
Here, this is what you have
to look forward to, yuma.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.590
As you can see, victory is mine,
and so is your number card!

face it, yuma.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.430
There's nothing you can do.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.590
Your future has been decided!

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.430
And in it you lose big time.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.990
My photos don't lie!

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.290
Maybe, maybe not.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.690
But still,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.890
I'm seein' this duel through!

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.890
bye Bye damage.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.360
First, I summon achacha Archer!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.490
And when this Archer
hits the field,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.390
you're automatically hit
with 500 points of damage!

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.730
Bullseye!

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.790
What a shot!

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.990
Yes quite a shot there, yuma.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.260
But it's nothing compared to
the shot my camera took earlier.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.030
You see, it's far more accurate
having predicted you'd play

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.730
achacha Archer and then place

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.490
the trap card Bye
Bye damage afterward.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.460
check out the photo as proof!

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.190
No way!

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.560
ASTRAL: The effect of the Bye
bye DAMAGE TRAP card yuma has

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.460
in his hand keeps
a monster that he

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.260
has on his field from being
destroyed when attacked.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.330
yuma would still take
damage as he normally would,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.230
but Cameron would
then be dealt double damage.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.990
It would have been
a great play But since

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.390
cameron somehow
saw it coming...

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.460
so? Just play it!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.560
You know it's your only move!

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.860
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.790
and If we cannot find a way to
stop Cameron's future Photos

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.790
from coming True, then that
may be yuma's last card!

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.760
Tori, can you hear me?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.360
TORI: Kari, that you?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.630
yeah, are you okay?

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.890
For now.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.530
what's going on
inside the airship?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.890
Panic!

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.330
It doesn't look good.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.660
There's smoke everywhere,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.730
people are frightened!

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.160
You just stay strong!

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.860
We're gonna get you outta this.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.330
My turn...

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.290
draw!

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.860
Look out for that
cameraclops, yuma.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.830
Since it is equipped
with telescopic lens,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.760
it gains 400 points
for every card in

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.490
Cameron's hand. That is
3000 total attack points.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.730
Which means if it attacks,
I'll take 1800 points of damage.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.630
But, if I activate
Bye Bye damage,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.760
I'd be able to deal
Cameron double for 3600 points!

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.460
yes, if Cameron does
not see it coming.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.660
I think I'll play the spell
card night beam right about now!

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.090
Not good!

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.530
Not good for you,
but great for me because

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.130
I can pick one of your
facedowns and destroy it!

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.960
So, which card shall I choose?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.090
I think I'll pick
the one on the...

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.760
right side!

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760
That was Bye Bye DAMAGE!

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.890
Next I summon out
scandal snapper!

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.060
Unfortunately, since I now have
two fewer cards in my hand,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.190
cameraclops loses 800
of its attack points.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.390
But that's still
plenty to pack a punch.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.260
Or in this case, a picture.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.430
Cameraclops, attack
achacha Archer!

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.430
And now get ready for your close
up, because scandal snapper

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.330
attacks you directly!

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.090
But this isn't over yet.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.190
Scandal snapper still has
its special ability!

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.460
See, it deals you damage, its
level revs up by 2, then it

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.560
switches from attack
mode to defense mode.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.760
Next up, I'm activating
the spell card

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.330
xyz frame from my hand!

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.960
And that means on your next
turn, you're not allowed to

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.590
attack with a non-Xyz monster.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.830
Talk about a
picture perfect move!

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.430
Oh, and speaking of pictures,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.330
we've finally
reached the Fifth turn!

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.060
And as I showed you before,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.360
it will be on that
fifth turn of yours,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.030
that you'll summon
utopia and then

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.000
you'll lose in the sixth!

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.190
Controller A: Who are you?

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.530
Controller B: This
area is off-Limits!

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.260
Don't you know we're in
the middle of an emergency?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.660
Of course I know that.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.260
Why do you think I'm here?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.630
Now tell me, which one of
you is calling the shots?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.130
Boss: That's me.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.390
Tell me everything you know.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.860
It's bad.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.730
The left engine has caught
fire and it's spreading fast!

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.790
to Make matters worse,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.690
all the smoke has caused
the pilots to pass out!

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.190
So who's flying that thing?

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.990
Well, no one is I'm afraid.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.090
So then what's the plan here?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.630
My turn!

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.160
I draw!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.990
Let me guess,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.860
you drew gogogo giant!

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.860
And since that's the only
monster currently in your hand,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.260
you'll summon it.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.090
That'll allow you to
summon gogogo golem

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.830
from your graveyard!

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.960
At which point you'll have
two level 4 monsters and you'll

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.260
overlay them to summon utopia
as my photos foretold.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.660
No way!

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.760
Go on yuma, play utopia.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.030
It's your destiny!

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.390
Tori, what is it?

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.760
the right engine.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.130
smoke's pouring
out of it as well!

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.330
Tori!

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.830
Don't worry, Tori.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.860
I'm going to beat
Cameron and when I do,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.590
everything he messed up

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.360
will go back to
how it should be!

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.860
Did you say 'Cameron'?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.630
What does he
have to do with this?

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.490
Wait, you know him?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.690
Yeah I ran into
him just today.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.890
Why?

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.490
Tell me what's going on!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.390
what's going on is he's the
one causing all this mayhem!

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.660
Well Not really him, but the
number that's taken hold of him.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.960
He can create the
future with his photos.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.390
And the futures that he's
created aren't the bright and

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.090
cheery kind,
they're all really bad!

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.160
I've seen what's happening now!

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Cameron showed me the picture.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.930
You're clutching a little
girl as we speak, am I right?

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.660
Yeah, you are!

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.130
I just can't believe the
guy who shot my portrait...

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.360
is now the guy who shot
the photo of my doom!

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.190
the doom of all
these poor people!

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.930
But, like you said,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.030
maybe you can
reverse these things.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.630
It's up to you, yuma!

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.930
I know it is,

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.560
and I promise
not to let you down!

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.060
then Perhaps yuma,

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.960
we should learn more on how
these photos are created.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.290
Yeah!

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.030
And to get to
the bottom of that,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.430
we'll need to learn
more about this number.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.060
There's not much to tell.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.290
This card enables me to make any
thought I have a reality simply

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.560
by thinking and snapping.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.290
No way!

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.430
I always wanted to
make the front page.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.090
So I would spend hours dreaming
up once-in-a-Lifetime shots.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.230
Like the airship
bursting into flames.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.590
But I was never in the
right place at the right time.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.560
It seemed that was
the story of my life,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.430
at least until that day.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.360
What day?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.990
The day my number card appeared.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.590
Suddenly everything changed!

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.890
I remember it oh so clearly.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.730
I was taking
Silly little photos.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.730
Then, I saw it.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.490
I approached it and
cautiously picked it up.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.860
It felt like it was
supposed to be mine.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.460
The card's power revealed
itself to me immediately.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.890
And that's when I realized

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.530
that the story of my
life had been re-written!

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.890
With the supernatural power
this number card gave to me,

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.360
I arranged for those

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.890
once in a lifetime moments
to become realities.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.990
And I can only imagine that
with each new number I acquire,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.430
my power will grow!

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.160
Then it's like
I was saying before!

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.030
No one duels for the
right reasons anymore.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.490
Well that all depends

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.030
what you believe
the right reasons are.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.360
You see,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.560
my number has also given me the
power to influence people's

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.590
perceptions of reality.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.260
Well that ends here.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.960
Then by all means,
just try and stop me.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.490
But let's be honest,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.190
you know you won't be
able to, after all,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.860
you've seen the
picture yourself!

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.560
You've already lost!

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.190
You're wrong!

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.730
You don't determine my fate,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.290
only I do!

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.530
You may have managed to trick
the other duelists into

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.260
believing they
don't have a choice,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.060
but you won't trick me!

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.360
of Course, that is it!

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.930
and now I'm gonna prove it.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.690
By taking you down right
here and now in this duel!

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.630
I summon out gogogo giant!

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.190
That's right,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.730
just as I said.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.030
And now go ahead and
activate its special ability.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.890
I now play my giant's ability,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.490
and bring back,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.390
gogogo golem in defense mode!

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.260
And since I used
giant's ability,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.430
it now switches to
defense mode, as well!

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.130
I'm set up perfectly
to summon utopia.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.230
And if you do
Cameron's predictions

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.430
will have come to pass.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.860
Remember what you said.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.730
You determine your fate.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.190
And only you.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.630
Utopia is a powerful card but

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.360
what is even more
powerful is free will.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.990
And you could use
that free will right now.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.530
You could use it
to show Cameron

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.760
his future Photos
are not set in stone.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.230
It is your choice, yuma.
But do choose well.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.030
I do not have to remind
you what is at stake here.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.490
Yes yes.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.030
You only have one
move left to make!

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.090
Now,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.430
play your Trump card.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.690
Play utopia!

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.530
Do it now!

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.790
I don't think so!

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.530
Say what?

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.030
Your predictions for the future
are ending right here with me!

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.660
Yeah, that's right!

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.000
It's a new duel!

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.760
I'm gonna end my turn, Cameron.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.490
And that means you're up!

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.830
No,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.160
impossible!

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.690
Utopia!

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.930
You were supposed to play it!

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.230
See for yourself,

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.730
my pictures never lie.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.130
First you'd summon gogogo
giant and golem, which you did.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.230
Then you would summon
number 39: Utopia!

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.990
Then when it becomes my turn,
I would destroy utopia!

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.690
I'd win the duel and your
number card would become mine!

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.590
That's what's in the photos,
that's what's supposed to be!

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.860
Your photos don't
mean anything!

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.030
I might not know how you create
those future photos of yours,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.890
but I do know I don't
have to do what they show!

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.090
So now, who knows
what's in store?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.190
So let's go!

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.660
Cuz the only way we're gonna
find out is to keep on dueling!

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.430
Fine, yuma!

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.030
Here we go!

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.530
My draw!

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.360
First I summon this card,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.530
here... it... comes!

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.630
Paparazzi pest!

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.930
Now I'll activate
its special ability!

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.960
I tribute paparazzi
pest to increase

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.030
cameraclops' level by 2.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.730
I overlay level 6 cameraclops
and scandal snapper so that I

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.830
can build the overlay network!

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.660
I xyz summon, number 25...

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.790
force focus!

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.190
That thing's gigantic!

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.460
Now,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.090
go force focus!

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.860
Destroy gogogo golem
with projection of pain!

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.230
Afraid your projections
are all wrong!

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.830
My golem can survive
an attack once Per turn!

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.990
Oh Yeah?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.090
I activate force
Focus' ability!

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.530
With it, once per turn, force
focus uses an overlay unit to

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.160
negate your monster's
special ability!

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.990
But hold on, instead
of me telling you,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.760
I'll let force
focus show you!

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.530
Oh Yeah!

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.990
Gogogo Golem is gone-Zo!

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.290
Let him laugh, now his photos
definitely will not come True.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.890
Oh yeah!

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.330
Hey!

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.290
You do realize by
destroying golem,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.330
I can't summon utopia
with Just gogogo giant!

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.790
Now I am certain

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.390
these future photos,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.030
are not for real.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.430
The only reason they worked
before was because Cameron was

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.190
so good at convincing
people they were.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.560
Duelists thought
that they had no choice.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.760
So they would subconsciously
behave in a manner that would

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.730
make the images come True.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.490
It was a
self-Fulfilling prophecy!

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.030
But the truth is,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.630
these images Cameron took were
all just one possible future.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.160
That was the power
the number possessed.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.230
Nothing more, nothing less!

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.730
The game is yours, yuma.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.230
Now win this duel!

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.490
No way, these pics...
I know they're real!

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.290
They're the future!

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.360
The future has
changed, Cameron!

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.330
And now we're going
to change it some more!

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.090
Because One of those possible
futures you snapped did come

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.130
True, but it doesn't have to do
with me, it has to do with my

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.060
friend Tori!

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.190
That is right and our time is to
save her is running out, yuma!

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.960
Yeah!

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.390
Too bad! If you think that
I'm going to help you,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.990
there's no way!

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.330
I'm gonna keep fighting
you until the very end!

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.190
Tori's done for, yuma!

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.890
Tori!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.330
It's my draw!

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.790
Here we go!

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.190
First I summon overlay OWL!

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.230
Next I activate
overlay owl's ability!

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.560
With it, by paying
600 life points,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.590
I can send one overlay
unit on your xyz monster

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.660
straight to the graveyard!

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.130
Not gonna happen.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.690
I'll simply use an overlay
unit to negate your owl's

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.630
special ability!

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:51.160
Go ahead, your monster will be
out of overlay units either way!

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.060
No!

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.560
And that means,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.730
you can't stop
me from doing this.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.430
I overlay level 4 gogogo giant

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.130
and overlay owl!

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.790
And now that the overlay
network has been created,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:12.690
I can xyz summon
number 39: Utopia!

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.360
At last, utopia!

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.030
The monster I've been
hoping Yuma would bring out!

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.660
The monster that
force focus will destroy...

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.490
On my next turn.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.190
You're not gettin' one!

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.960
End this now, yuma!

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.490
That's the plan.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.360
Gooooo!

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.030
Chaos Xyz exchange!

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.860
And Appear, chaos
number 39: Utopia ray!

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.490
What's happening?

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.330
Utopia Ray's special
ability is happenin'!

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:04.060
see, for every overlay unit I
use, it gains 500 attack points.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.990
Go overlay charge!

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.160
Then your monster loses 1000

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.690
attack points for
each overlay unit!

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.690
No way. This isn't happening.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.430
Oh it's happening alright,
and do ya know why?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.590
Because the future we make for
ourselves is always stronger

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.430
than the future
someone predicts for us!

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.230
Now go, utopia ray!

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.630
End this with rising
SUN chaos slash!

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.130
Tori.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.330
Kari?

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.560
Are you guys there?

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.760
I defeated Cameron.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.490
Is everything okay?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.160
Tori!

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.390
yuma!

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.730
Kari?

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.030
I don't know what's happening.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.890
You may have defeated Cameron,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.890
but the airship is still
in Big time trouble.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.630
no, that can't be!

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.060
Look!

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.260
There's an unidentified aircraft
approaching the airship fast!

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.960
It came out of nowhere!

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.590
Is that...

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.360
tell me, what's going on!

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.960
Yuma, look to the sky!

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.130
Huh?

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.360
Kite?

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.560
No way!

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.260
Someone's taken
control of the ship!

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.030
And somehow they're
stabilizing the craft!

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.090
But the engines are blown.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.390
Kite: Now orbital,

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.860
full power!

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.130
Orbital 7: You got it!

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.090
MOTHER: Thank goodness
you're okay.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.990
Tori!

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.390
Yuma,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.460
thank you for saving me!

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.160
I'd love to take credit but...

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.990
but there's your hero.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.360
It's like I said, duelists are
part of one big family and today

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.190
Kite proved that.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.490
Get real yuma.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.690
I did this so the duel carnival
wouldn't be jeopardized.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.330
See you in the finals
if you can make it there.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.390
Oh I'll be there, Kite.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.560
Cameron?

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.730
Really?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.030
Still with the pictures?

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.660
Just habit I guess.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.930
Look guys,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.190
I'm sorry.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.260
For everything that I did.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.130
Will you ever be
able to forgive me?

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.590
Okay.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.330
Yeah, I guess that
sinister number card's

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.390
the one to blame, not you.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.760
Thanks yuma.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.060
What's up?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.690
You two look cute together.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.830
Look.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.160
Ya see, great photos don't

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.090
always need to be
filled with action.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.130
You think...
It's great?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.690
Sure do!

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.130
But the greatest
is yet to come!

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.930
The photo of me as the duel
carnival Supreme champion!

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.160
I doubt even Cameron is good
enough to fake that one, yuma.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.330
What?

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.660
How dare you!

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.990
Who are you talking to, yuma?

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.000
Aw, if only I had a photo...
