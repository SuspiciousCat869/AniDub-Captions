00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:02.542
I'm sure you won't object
to that, will you?

00:07:02.576 --> 00:07:05.209
If you win, the council
won't have disciplinarians

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:07.009
for the school anymore.

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:08.342
Sounds good to me!

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:09.709
Now let's
start dueling!

00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:11.509
One more thing,
since this duel

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:12.909
will be held
on school grounds,

00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:15.476
it must stick to all
school rules.

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:16.909
Do you agree?

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:18.509
You're on!

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:21.009
Attention, Disciplinarian
Caswell.

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:22.976
Make sure all rules
are strictly followed

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.742
and enforced during
our duel.

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:25.876
Yes, sir!

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:27.176
Let's start!

Let's duel!

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:47.376
I'm up first,
Carlyle!

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.476
It's time to draw!

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:52.842
To start, I'll summon
Gagaga Magician!

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:55.742
I'm countin'
on ya, Gagaga--

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:57.009
(Caswell)
Not so fast!

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:58.476
Hold it right there!

00:07:58.509 --> 00:07:59.476
You broke the rules!

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:00.476
But how?!

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.009
I just got started!

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.709
There's no chains
allowed in school!

00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:06.876
And no bling either!

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:08.342
Plus, faces
cannot be covered.

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:10.976
Even monsters have to obey
the dress code!

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:13.342
Those are serious
violations.

00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.909
What's the penalty,
Chief Disciplinarian?

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:18.076
Automatic suspension!

00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:21.042
That Gagaga has to
go back in your hand!

00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:24.676
But that's
totally unfair.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.242
Not at all, Yuma.

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:27.809
I told you our duel had to
follow all

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:29.376
of the school rules.

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.709
Which means
you cannot summon

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:33.476
any monster that violates
those rules.

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:34.842
Well, that's not good.

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:36.209
Try using your brain

00:08:36.242 --> 00:08:38.176
before agreeing to
suspicious duels.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:40.942
Thanks,
now you tell me!

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:42.442
I'll have to end
my turn for now

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:44.309

mean I'm giving up.

I draw!

00:08:56.109 --> 00:08:57.776
And right at the start,
I'll activate

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:00.509
my Mirror Stage
of Discipline spell card.

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:02.909
Once activated, this spell
returns all the monsters

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.109
on my field

00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:05.909
to their original
attack and defense points.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:11.609
And next I'm summoning
Tamagushi, the Righteous!

You can't summon
a Level 6 monster

00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:23.342
without tributing
anything!

00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.242
(Astral)
He can if he lowers
its attack points to zero

it's weak.

Remember my Mirror Stage
of Discipline spell?

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:33.909
It returns Tamagushi to
her original attack points.

00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:35.776
So there is no violation.

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.509
(Caswell)
That's right, Mr. President.

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:42.209
This is all part of
Carlyle's strategy.

00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.176
Next I bring out
my star pupil,

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.042
Sakaki,
the Honor Student!

00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:50.576
I can summon Sakaki whenever
Tamagushi's on the field.

00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:54.476
Both of those
monsters are Level 6!

00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:55.909
Prepare yourself,
Yuma.

00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:59.009
Now watch as my Level 6
Tamagushi and Sakaki

00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:02.309
earn themselves
an "A-plus" for teamwork!

00:10:02.342 --> 00:10:04.642
For extra credit, these
two perfect pupils

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:06.609
will build
the Overlay Network!

00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:09.909
I Xyz Summon Norito
the Moral Leader!

00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:13.942
Get ready,
Norito the Moral Leader.

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:16.309
Strike at Yuma with
all your might!

00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:20.942
Wait!

00:10:20.976 --> 00:10:24.009
I'm activating the trap card
Impenetrable Attack!

00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:25.409
It shields me
from your attack

00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:27.042
so I take zero damage!

00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:29.476
You can't escape
punishment so easily!

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:31.809
Norito, use your
special ability!

00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.676
By using one Overlay Unit,
Norito negates your trap

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:39.342
and then zaps
it out of existence.

00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:43.277
Now do your duty,
Norito.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:45.810
Ahh!

00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:49.317
Ahh!

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.283
Maybe now you'll learn to
respect the rules, Yuma.

00:10:58.317 --> 00:10:59.550
I end my turn.

00:11:01.883 --> 00:11:03.017
I draw!

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.250
Please wait.

00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:06.450
If you summon a monster
that breaks school rules,

00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:08.893
it will be removed.

00:11:08.927 --> 00:11:11.727
Yeah, but that's
practically all of them!

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.993
Then again, as long as they

00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:14.593
don't catch me
breakin' the rules,

00:11:14.627 --> 00:11:16.327
I should be okay!

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.860
I'll put a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:20.493
Take that, Carlyle!

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:22.193
You can't penalize me
when you don't know

00:11:22.227 --> 00:11:24.960
if I broke
the rules or not.

00:11:24.993 --> 00:11:27.860
Wait, I'm making
a surprise inspection!

00:11:27.893 --> 00:11:29.093
I can use this trap

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:31.060
to take one monster
that's facedown

00:11:31.093 --> 00:11:32.393
and flip it face-up!

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.360
(groaning)

00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:37.193
Uh-oh, hide, quick!

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:38.627
(whistle blowing)

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.093
Rule violation!

00:11:40.127 --> 00:11:41.927
There are several,
in fact!

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.227
For one thing,
that scarf is way too long,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.827
plus, she has an
oversized ribbon

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.827
and her accessories
are an eyesore!

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.660
In fact, her whole outfit
flouts the school dress code!

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.127
Especially that hideous
hat on her head.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.360
How would you advise us

00:11:56.393 --> 00:11:59.093
to handle this matter,
Chief Disciplinarian?

00:11:59.127 --> 00:12:00.727
The penalty is clear.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.560
It's suspension!

00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:04.660
She must leave
the field at once!

00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:06.627
Not if I use
my Clear Robe spell

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.393
to cover Gagaga Girl up!

00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:11.527
This card lets my monster
stay on the field

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.760
by lowering its attack
and defense points to zero.

00:12:14.793 --> 00:12:16.693
Now you see it,
now you don't!

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.560
Oh, yeah!

00:12:20.593 --> 00:12:23.460
Since Gagaga Girl and her
attire are now invisible,

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.560
she cannot be
suspended again, unless...

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:28.860
Always trying to
bend the rules.

00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:30.893
But it won't work, Yuma.

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:33.027
You can't hide your
rule-breaking from me,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.793
because I activate Norito's
special ability.

00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:38.327
It'll use an Overlay Unit
to destroy your spell!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.527
I'm afraid Gagaga Girl
is in detention.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.660
(screaming)

00:12:47.127 --> 00:12:48.893
No fair!

00:12:48.927 --> 00:12:50.427
I can't use any cards!

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.660
Calm yourself and try using
Tatakawa Knight.

00:12:53.693 --> 00:12:54.960
Oh, yeah.

00:12:54.993 --> 00:12:56.893
I activate
Tatakawa Knight's

00:12:56.927 --> 00:12:59.693
special ability
from my hand!

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:01.460
When you negate
my spell or trap

00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:03.660
and you're the only one with
monsters on the field,

00:13:03.693 --> 00:13:05.393
I can send this
card to the graveyard

00:13:05.427 --> 00:13:08.627
and you get walloped with
1500 points of damage!

00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:11.027
Ahh!

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.860
Stay on the offensive and you
can win this battle.

00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:17.027
Right!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.393
You act like
a perfect student,

00:13:18.427 --> 00:13:19.660
when all you're really doing

00:13:19.693 --> 00:13:22.960
is twisting the rules
around to your advantage!

00:13:22.993 --> 00:13:24.660
I'll use Monster Reborn

00:13:24.693 --> 00:13:27.627
to summon Tamagushi
from your graveyard,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.327
but now it's in defense
mode on my side.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.160
You-- you can't do that!

00:13:32.193 --> 00:13:33.327
Yes, I can.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.327
And since this monster
was yours to begin with,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.927
I'm sure it doesn't break
any rules, now does it?

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.993
I didn't think so.

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:43.527
It's your turn,
Carlyle.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.727
That's it!

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.660
Yuma!

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.127
You crossed me
for the last time!

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.827
Chief Disciplinarian,
you saw Yuma

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.760
directly attack
me on school grounds--

00:13:52.793 --> 00:13:54.093
a major offense!

00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:55.727
I demand
those points back!

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.460
Then again... you also made
a direct attack

00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:00.893
on Yuma using
your Norito card, sir.

00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:02.060
I don't care!

00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:04.827
Didn't you just witness Yuma
stealing my monster?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.093
We can't allow
a thief in our school.

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:10.060
Yuma Tsukumo must be expelled
permanently!

00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.293
Mr. President,
that's going too far!

00:14:12.327 --> 00:14:14.927
That's right,
Caswell, way too far!

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.160
He's been acting
like a tyrant

00:14:16.193 --> 00:14:18.393
so why are
you helping him?

00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:21.060
Why did you all of a sudden
become his flunky?

00:14:23.327 --> 00:14:25.593
What choice
do I have, Yuma?

00:14:25.627 --> 00:14:27.660
After all, you were elected
class representative

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:30.193
in my place
and I was left with nothing!

00:14:30.227 --> 00:14:32.060
I agreed to serve
as the school's

00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:34.627
chief disciplinarian
because I still wanted to be

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.660
important around here!

00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:40.027
And that's the reason you're
doing Carlyle's bidding?

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.293
Listen, when you first
ran for class representative,

00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:45.393
was it 'cause you wanted to
be important then to?

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.027
No, I just wanted to help
the other students.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.693
By serving as
class representative,

00:14:49.727 --> 00:14:51.793
I thought I could make
the school a better place.

00:14:51.827 --> 00:14:53.827
That's why I ran for office.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.460
To help the school...
yes, that's why.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.727
Who cares if you're on
the student council?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.593
You can still
help the school.

00:15:02.627 --> 00:15:03.593
If that's your dream,

00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:06.493
don't give it up
no matter what!

00:15:06.527 --> 00:15:08.560
It's true.

00:15:08.593 --> 00:15:09.993
That is my dream.

00:15:12.193 --> 00:15:14.427
Helping the students here
is what counts.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.860
As for this uniform...

00:15:17.027 --> 00:15:19.293
... Carlyle
can take it back!

00:15:19.327 --> 00:15:20.293
Huh?

00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:21.493
Way to go!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.393
You're going back to
regular dueling rules now!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.793
Now go school our student
council president

00:15:29.827 --> 00:15:31.093
in how to really duel!

00:15:31.127 --> 00:15:32.127
Totally!

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.560
♪

00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:36.027
You'll regret betraying me,
Caswell!

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.060
I'll take care of
you after I crush Yuma!

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.327
I activate a spell
from my hand.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.760
Rank-Up-Magic
Barian's Force!

00:15:44.793 --> 00:15:46.793
Ha-ha!

00:15:46.827 --> 00:15:48.927
Barian?
Of course.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.893
It gives me
unbeatable power.

00:15:50.927 --> 00:15:53.427
This Barian spell ranks up
my Xyz Monster

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.960
into a Chaos Xyz Monster!

00:15:55.993 --> 00:15:58.293
Now I'll use
Norito The Moral Leader

00:15:58.327 --> 00:16:01.393
to rebuild the Overlay
Network!

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:04.693
Go, Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:16:04.727 --> 00:16:07.260
Your judgment
is at hand, Yuma!

00:16:07.293 --> 00:16:08.760
You'll get no mercy from

00:16:08.793 --> 00:16:12.660
CXyz Simon The Great
Moral Leader!

00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:14.160
You're finished!

00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:17.093
Watch as Simon's special
ability activates!

00:16:17.127 --> 00:16:19.360
Using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:16:19.393 --> 00:16:20.593
my Moral Leader

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:24.027
switches your monster from
defense to attack mode.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.727
You're about to get booted
out of this school, Yuma!

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.860
CXyz Simon
The Great Moral Leader,

00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:30.193
eliminate Tamagushi!

00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:35.287
(Carlyle)
You're about to get booted out
of this school, Yuma!

00:16:35.321 --> 00:16:37.654
CXyz Simon
The Great Moral Leader,

00:16:37.687 --> 00:16:39.154
eliminate Tamagushi!

00:16:43.054 --> 00:16:45.687
There's gonna be one less
problem student around here.

00:16:47.587 --> 00:16:49.054
Surprise.

00:16:49.087 --> 00:16:51.054
That almost worked,
Carlyle.

00:16:51.087 --> 00:16:54.187
But luckily I activated
my Half Unbreak trap

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:56.287
right before you
attacked Tamagushi.

00:16:57.954 --> 00:16:59.421
(Astral)
Very clever, Yuma!

00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:01.321
The card's effect saves
Tamagushi

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.287
because it can not be
destroyed in battle this turn.

00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:06.254
And Half Unbreak reduces
the damage

00:17:06.287 --> 00:17:07.621
that you took by half.

00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:10.187
So you held out.

00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:11.921
But not for
much longer!

00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:14.487
I'm activating my spell
Double Check!

00:17:14.521 --> 00:17:15.854
It wipes out one monster

00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:18.054
that wasn't destroyed
in battle this turn!

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:19.687
So long, Tamagushi!

00:17:19.721 --> 00:17:21.821
Yuma's putting up
a fierce fight,

00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:24.587
but he only has
300 life points left!

00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.754
It's not enough.

00:17:25.787 --> 00:17:28.087
I'm sorry I got you in this
mess, Yuma!

00:17:28.121 --> 00:17:30.421
I'm still in this duel,
don't worry!

00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:34.121
Being down a few points just
makes it more interesting.

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:35.621
It's my draw, Carlyle!

00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:38.187
Awesome.

00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:39.521
Go for it, Yuma!

00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:40.654
Right!

00:17:40.687 --> 00:17:42.587
Gagaga Magician...
you're on!

00:17:45.354 --> 00:17:46.521
Gagaga!

00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:51.721
And next I'm activating,
the spell Gagagawind!

00:17:51.754 --> 00:17:53.387
I can summon
a Gagaga monster

00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:55.487
and raise its
Level by 1!

00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:58.187
Your Suspension
is over, Gagaga Girl!

00:17:58.221 --> 00:17:59.921
And now that they're
both back,

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.887
I'm gonna Overlay
my Level 4

00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:04.754
Gagaga Magician
and Gagaga Girl!

00:18:04.787 --> 00:18:05.954
With these two monsters

00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:07.454
I build
the Overlay Network

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:11.421

Number 39: Utopia!

It's clearly not
powerful enough

00:18:20.487 --> 00:18:22.821
to beat Simon
The Great Moral Leader!

00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:27.154
It is with Gagaga Girl's
special ability!

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:30.387
When she and Gagaga Magician
become Overlay Units together,

00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:32.454
then the attack points of
your Xyz Monster

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.587
on your field
are zeroed out!

00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:37.254
So your Great Moral Leader
isn't so great anymore.

Simon!

00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:40.887
It is vulnerable now!

(Bronk)
When we heard what was
goin' on, we hurried over!

Is everything okay
now, Yuma?

be friends anymore,
I'll understand.
