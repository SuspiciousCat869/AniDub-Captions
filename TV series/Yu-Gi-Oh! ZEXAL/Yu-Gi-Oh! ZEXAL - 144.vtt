WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.539
(Yuma) Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal..."

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:07.211
This duel's over.
You've won.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.047
Huh♪ Say what♪

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:11.150
Shark!

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:16.691
I lost.

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.999
But I never knew losing
could feel so good.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:26.606
You have your whole entire
future ahead of you, Yuma.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:29.444
I wish I was around to see it.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.314
(gasps) No!

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:33.317
You were great duelists,

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.688
but even better friends.

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.626
Shark!

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.596
Good-bye.

It looks like your boy
saved the day.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:49.598
Yes. The three worlds
are drifting apart.

00:01:49.598 --> 00:01:52.135
We owe it all to Yuma.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:55.807
Not saying you didn't
lend a helping hand.

00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:57.276
Thanks, Byron.

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:00.180
Oh, sure.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.083
Good of you to remember.

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.789
It's not like pushing
a planet was hard work.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:06.691
Indeed.

00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:08.225
Until next time, Kazuma.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:10.095
Until next time.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.198
And I hope it won't
be too long.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.637
(Yuma) I can't believe it.

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:17.506
Shark's gone.

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.509
(crying)

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.813
(Yuma) It's all my fault.

00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:24.417
(crying)

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.560
But I don't wanna
duel a monkey.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.260
Huh?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.629
Hey, Flip's back!

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.098
Huh?

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.439
I'm home.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.843
I'm home!

00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:44.681
How long have I been out?

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.585
(Astral) Shark's defeat has
severed the fusion

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.254
between Barian World and Earth,

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:54.429
returning those that were
defeated in our skirmish.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.169
I made it.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.274
But what about Shark?

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.845
I had faith that Yuma
would get the job done.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.620
Yeah. Same here. But it
must've been tough on him.

00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:15.293
Yuma! I knew
you'd rescue me!

00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:18.431
Because I'm your
bestest buddy, right?

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.499
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.569
I'm glad you're safe and sound.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.172
Yuma!
Yuma!

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:24.474
Huh?

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:26.443
(all) Yuma!

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:27.511
Hey, guys!

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.614
Don't forget about me!

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:30.383
Bronk!

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:32.653
Heads up, Yuma!

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:36.125
Anna!
The Sparrow!

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.332
The gang's all here!

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.505
(Yuma) I'm so glad you're okay.

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:48.243
I knew you'd never
let us down, Yuma.

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:50.446
You totally beat
those Barian bums.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.818
Thanks, guys.
That means a lot to me.

00:03:53.818 --> 00:03:58.191
Yuma. You did it.
You saved everyone.

00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:00.428
No, Heart.

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:02.698
You're wrong.

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:04.200
(Heart) What?

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.101
Not everyone, Heart.

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:09.274
I tried, but I wasn't
able to save Shark

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:12.479
or your brother Kite.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.882
Not even Rio.

00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:17.152
If I never started dueling
in the first place,

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:20.591
none of this would have
happened.

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:26.533
Poor Yuma.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:38.351
Huh?

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:42.190
What did you do, Astral?

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.193
Oh!

00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:46.530
(roaring)

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.839
(Astral) Yuma, we have finally
accomplished our goal

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.909
of gathering all
100 Number Cards.

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.215
Their combined energies allow me
to access to the Numeron Code,

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:03.523
the source of all creation
throughout the universe.

00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:05.526
The Numeron Code!

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:07.729
It gives me the power
to rewrite

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.298
both the future and the past.

00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:12.903
I shall use it fulfill
my final mission.

00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:13.738
That is my destiny.

00:05:13.738 --> 00:05:18.278
But we finished
our final mission.

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:19.246
You don't mean...

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:24.520
My mission:
To annihilate Barian World.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.356
Huh?

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:28.893
I thought you were
done with that nonsense!

00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:29.228
No.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.199
Barian World is the enemy
of Astral World.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.502
It must be extinguished.

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:35.504
Oh!

00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:38.875
Haven't you learned
anything at all, Astral?

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:41.446
Shark sacrificed
himself for us!

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:44.717
You don't have to
fight anymore.

00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:47.922
Your two worlds
can be at peace.

00:05:47.922 --> 00:05:50.793
Peace may have been your goal.

00:05:50.793 --> 00:05:52.396
It is not mine.

00:05:52.396 --> 00:05:56.201
Mine remains the destruction
of Barian World.

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:57.570
Dream on, Astral,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.807
because that ain't happening!

00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:00.841
You disapprove?

00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:02.344
You may be my friend,

00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:03.946
but I can't let you do this.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.951
And how do you plan
to stop me, Yuma?

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:10.222
Do you dare challenge me
to a duel?

00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:10.656
You bet!

00:06:10.656 --> 00:06:13.361
You must realize the foolishness
of your endeavor.

00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:17.767
Since I possess all the Number
Cards, you cannot win.

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:20.438
Do you still wish to duel?

00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:21.940
More than ever.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.943
Very well.
But when I win,

00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:26.713
I will do more than destroy
Barian World.

00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:30.954
I will use the Numeron Code
to erase your memories.

00:06:30.954 --> 00:06:33.958
It will be as if we never met.

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.261
Agreed?

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.797
Agreed.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.533
Very well.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:43.940
We shall duel tonight at the
courtyard where we first met.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.243
Where's Astral?
He just vanished.

00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:47.946
He could've
said good-bye.

00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:49.949
(Bronk) Maybe he was in a rush,

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.187
like the time I ate 16 mondo
chili dogs and...

00:06:53.187 --> 00:06:55.724
Bronk, stop sharing.

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.933
(thinking)
Can I really build a deck
that can beat Astral?

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:04.570
I thought we'd always fight
together as friends,

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.975
never against each other
as enemies.

00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:11.982
So now our first duel will
also be our last.

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:20.862
Lighten up, Astral.

00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:24.568
That's not the look of someone
who saved the entire galaxy.

00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:28.206
I can't thank you enough for
all you've done for Yuma.

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:30.577
You should not be thanking me.

00:07:30.577 --> 00:07:33.681
I am forcing your son
to partake in a duel

00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.350
that he does not desire.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.989
Sounds heavy, but do what
you gotta do.

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.960
I'm sure it's gonna be an
amazing duel.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.532
Do you not care that
I broke Yuma's heart?

00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:47.001
Maybe, maybe not.

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.674
Your carefree demeanor
puzzles me.

00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:51.975
Or maybe I know that there is

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:55.981
more to this duel
than Barian World.

00:07:57.984 --> 00:07:59.653
Uhh!

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:00.655
Gotta focus.
Okay.

00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:04.394
Not only does Astral have all
the Numbers in his deck,

00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:07.565
he also has a stackload of
Utopias.

00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:11.004
How can I counteract that?

00:08:11.004 --> 00:08:13.574
Incoming!

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.980
Aah!

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:19.016
What's up, Yuma?

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.388
You weren't
using that wall, were you?

00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:25.359
Anna!
And company.

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:27.996
We know that you're
dueling Astral.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.898
We shall not miss it.

00:08:29.898 --> 00:08:30.767
I'll say.

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:32.002
We're super psyched.

00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:33.404
We're here to help you out.

00:08:33.404 --> 00:08:37.010
Thanks, but couldn't
you knock first?

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.011
Yuma!

00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:39.813
They better not be
staying for dinner.

00:08:39.813 --> 00:08:42.685
But I made enough food
for seconds and thirds.

00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:45.455
And fourths. And fifths.
And sixths.

00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:48.460
Kari, Yuma has made many
lifelong friends,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.630
and it's all thanks to dueling.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.433
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:54.336
Maybe dueling's fine, I guess.

00:08:54.336 --> 00:08:56.472
Say, maybe if you
tried dueling,

00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:58.008
you'd make some
new friends, too.

00:08:58.008 --> 00:09:02.815
It's not like your social life
is very active, dear.

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:04.284
(groans)

00:09:04.284 --> 00:09:06.254
As much as I'd love
to sit and chat,

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.993
I don't have much time
to build my new deck.

00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:11.962
That is why we're here,

00:09:11.962 --> 00:09:14.466
to offer you
a cavalcade of cards.

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:18.038
See? In the end,
Astral's deck will be tough.

00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:20.408
Yeah, you need all
the help you can get.

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:22.345
Our cards will
soup up your deck.

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:24.047
And Astral will
never see it coming.

00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:26.784
I can't think of a more
purr-fect plan!

00:09:26.784 --> 00:09:30.623
It'll be like we're all
dueling Astral together.

00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:31.759
I guess so.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:35.030
We heroes shall
unite and fight.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.899
What do you say, Yuma?

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:39.971
Thanks for the offer, but no.

00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:44.544
I hate to be selfish, but I need
to use my own cards.

00:09:44.544 --> 00:09:48.050
This is one duel that
I have to face on my own.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.786
Sorry, guys.

00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:53.057
(Bronk)
Eh! No biggie.

00:09:53.057 --> 00:09:54.326
All right, fine.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:55.628
If that's the way you want it,

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.063
then that's how it's gonna be.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.332
But don't come crying

00:09:58.332 --> 00:10:01.871
when you lose by
a bazillion life points.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.843
Thanks, Bronk.

00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:08.414
I'm gonna build
the best deck ever!

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:12.486
I'm so feeling the flow!

00:10:12.953 --> 00:10:15.725
I'm so excited for you, Yuma!

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:18.362
You get to duel
your best friend.

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:21.734
It'll be tons of fun.

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.637
What's wrong?

00:10:23.637 --> 00:10:24.538
Tori, listen.

00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:27.074
Astral isn't who
we thought he was.

00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:30.079
I'll let you in on
a secret, okay?

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:32.082
But promise not to tell anyone.

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:34.453
I promise.

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:47.439
I assume that you
are ready to duel.

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:50.844
Oh, yeah!
And I'm gonna win!

00:10:50.844 --> 00:10:52.546
Yuma versus Astral.

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:54.616
I never thought
I'd see the day.

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:55.551
This should be interesting.

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:59.824
I'll say. The kid's got plenty
of moxie to duel Astral.

00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:01.494
Yuma's bringing the boom!

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.697
Oh, I think Astral will win.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:04.731
Good luck.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:05.766
Show 'em your fangs, Yuma.

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.604
(thinking)
They just think it's
fun and games.

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:13.043
They have no idea
what's at stake.

00:11:13.043 --> 00:11:16.082
Quattro, Trey, we should
feel privileged

00:11:16.082 --> 00:11:17.851
that we get to witness
this match.

00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:21.857
But yet something about this
duel gives me pause.

00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:24.528
But I don't know why.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:30.470
Let us begin.
Ready?

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.105
Always!

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:36.112
Time for me to
high five the sky!

00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:40.051
Duel Disk, go!

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:48.096
Duel Gazer, let's roll.

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:55.708
(computer)
Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:03.392
Let's duel.
Let's duel.

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:14.135
Let's duel.
Let's duel.

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:16.539
I'll go first.

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:17.774
My turn.

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:20.011
I draw!

00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:23.984
Let's get this show
on the road.

00:12:23.984 --> 00:12:27.422
Here's Gogogo Golem!

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.666
And then I place
three cards facedown.

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:36.903
You're up, Astral.

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:37.671
(thinking) Curious.

00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:40.642
Why would he summon Gogogo Golem
in attack mode

00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:43.580
when it is better at defense?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.149
My move.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:47.152
I draw!

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.126
I activate
the spell Parallel Unit.

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.764
This card copies your monster,

00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:58.569
so I have a Gogogo Golem
of my own.

00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.613
Next, I shall activate
Solid Overlay.

00:13:05.613 --> 00:13:11.055
This spell substitutes for a
monster when I Xyz Summon.

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:11.822
This should be good.

00:13:11.822 --> 00:13:17.764
With these two cards, I build
the Overlay Network.

00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:23.139
I Xyz Summon!

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:27.145
Rise, Number 39: Utopia!

00:13:40.098 --> 00:13:42.602
Astral has already
summoned Utopia!

00:13:42.602 --> 00:13:43.837
Yeah.

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:46.475
This is a first.

00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:49.612
I've always fought with
Utopia, never against it.

00:13:49.612 --> 00:13:54.453
Now, Yuma, I activate Double
Rank-Up Magic Utopia Force.

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:58.158
I shall utilize Utopia's
abilities to its fullest,

00:13:58.158 --> 00:14:01.463
which is something you were
never capable of doing.

00:14:01.463 --> 00:14:05.169
With this spell,
I summon two Xyz monsters

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:07.172
that are higher in rank
than Utopia,

00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:12.547
and then Utopia's two Overlay
Units are divided among them.

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:22.195
First to my field is Chaos
Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory.

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:30.908
Followed by Number 39:
Utopia Beyond.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:39.120
He's got three Utopias!

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.889
I am not done.

00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:42.992
Go, Utopia Beyond.

00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:45.029
Its special ability eliminates

00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:49.202
all of Gogogo Golem's
attack points.

00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:51.205
Yuma's in big trouble!
Yeah.

00:14:51.438 --> 00:14:54.210
How's he going to
crawl out of this mess?

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.211
So what?

00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:57.681
I activate my trap Guardraw!

00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.153
It switches my monster
to defense mode.

00:15:01.153 --> 00:15:04.592
And I also get to draw a card.

00:15:04.592 --> 00:15:06.795
When Gogogo Golem's
in defense mode,

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:08.164
Yuma can survive two attacks

00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:10.500
without taking
any damage at all.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.738
I gotta hand it to him.
That was pretty slick.

00:15:13.738 --> 00:15:17.043
Perhaps. But I doubt
it will work.

00:15:17.043 --> 00:15:18.112
Utopia Ray Victory,

00:15:18.112 --> 00:15:21.650
attack Gogogo Golem
with all your might.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.754
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:15:23.754 --> 00:15:28.895
Gogogo Golem cannot use
its special abilities.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.233
Furthermore,

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:37.842
you cannot play your spell or
trap cards during this battle.

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:39.076
Uugghh!

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:43.717
Rising Sun
Double Victory Slash!

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:58.239
Rising Sun
Double Victory Slash!

00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:06.251
I play a trap!

00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:09.523
I activate my Guard Go.

00:16:09.523 --> 00:16:11.960
You may have destroyed
Gogogo Golem,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.696
but it isn't
staying away for long

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:18.069
because this trap resurrects
it from the graveyard.

00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:20.238
Welcome back!

00:16:22.976 --> 00:16:25.212
Guard Go has another effect.

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:29.151
I get to invite two more
monsters to this party.

00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:31.990
Say hello to Dododo Warrior

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.663
and the one and only
Gagaga Magician.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.035
Impressive.

00:16:40.035 --> 00:16:42.071
You have instantly
tripled your defense.

00:16:42.071 --> 00:16:47.847
But my Utopias will erode
your wall of monsters.

00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:52.954
Continue the onslaught!

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:00.766
Is that the best you got?

00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:01.601
Far from it, Yuma!

00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:07.276
I activate Rank-Up
Magic Dark Force.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:10.180
No way! He has another
Rank-Up Magic?

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.620
When my Xyz Monster destroys
your monster in battle,

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.122
I can send it to the graveyard

00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:20.796
to summon two new Xyz Monsters
with even higher ranks.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:25.603
Utopia, make way for
Chaos Number 39:

00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:28.974
Utopia Ray V!

00:17:32.847 --> 00:17:36.953
And Number 25: Force Focus!

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.960
You've got me outnumbered
four to one.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.597
Four to one?
Let me change that.

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:45.934
I activate Grave Chaos.

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:48.137
Since Utopia was sent
to the graveyard,

00:17:48.137 --> 00:17:52.945
I can summon a Chaos Xyz Monster
that has the same rank.

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:55.281
I shall summon another Utopia!

00:17:55.281 --> 00:18:01.090
Chaos Number 39:
Utopia Ray!

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:09.102
But why stop at four Utopias
when I can have five?

00:18:09.102 --> 00:18:13.775
Utopia Beyond uses one Overlay
Unit to banish Force Focus

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:18.315
and bring Utopia back
from the graveyard.

00:18:24.124 --> 00:18:26.294
Lastly I also gain life points

00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:30.835
equal to half of Utopia's
2,500 attack points.

00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:38.914
Do you still hold
the absurd notion

00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:40.816
that you can win, Yuma?

00:18:40.816 --> 00:18:43.220
Astral summoned five Utopias!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.590
The kid's in a whole
world of trouble.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.060
I know. Astral has
a huge advantage.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.263
This doesn't look like
a fair fight.

00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:52.734
That's the understatement
of the year.

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.637
Astral's kinda intense.

00:18:54.637 --> 00:18:55.939
Actually, he's pretty scary.

00:18:55.939 --> 00:18:57.208
What's gotten into him?

00:18:57.208 --> 00:19:01.180
(Bronk)
Yeah. Wasn't this supposed
to be a friendly duel?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.652
Astral's going to destroy
Barian World?

00:19:04.652 --> 00:19:05.853
That's right.

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:08.825
And I'm the only one
who can stop him.

00:19:08.825 --> 00:19:10.962
By winning our duel.

00:19:10.962 --> 00:19:12.965
Everybody loves Astral,

00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:14.801
so I don't want them
to know the truth.

00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:19.608
So let's just keep this
secret between you and me.

00:19:19.608 --> 00:19:21.911
(Yuma)
I don't want to tarnish
their memories.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:27.786
It 's not like he" 's gonna erase
theirs, only mine.

00:19:27.786 --> 00:19:29.322
Utopia, attack!

00:19:29.624 --> 00:19:31.893
Destroy Gogogo Golem!

00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:32.660
You wish!

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.028
When Golem is in defense mode,

00:19:34.028 --> 00:19:38.399
it can't be destroyed
once per turn.

00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:42.403
But my others can attack.

00:19:42.403 --> 00:19:43.137
Utopia Ray,

00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:48.409
attack Gogogo Golem with
Rising Sun Chaos Slash!

00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:55.883
Your end is near.

00:19:55.883 --> 00:19:59.887
Utopia Ray V,
attack Yuma directly!

00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:03.624
Rising Sun Star Slash!

00:20:08.629 --> 00:20:11.065
Uhh!

00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:19.340
Yuma's taking a beating.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.411
I know. And it doesn't
look like Astral cares.

00:20:23.411 --> 00:20:25.413
Astral's playing hardball.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:27.081
Is Yuma okay?

00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:28.750
Yuma.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.285
(groaning)

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.423
(groaning)

00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:10.077
