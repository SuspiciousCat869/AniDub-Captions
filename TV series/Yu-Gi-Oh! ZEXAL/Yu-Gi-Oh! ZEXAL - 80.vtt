00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.181
When I sent Girag to
the humans' world,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.083
I made his mission clear,

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.653
he was to defeat Yuma Tsukumo
and get his Numbers.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:24.758
But clearly he is not
strong enough for the task!

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.759
Alito!

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.629
Alito, where are you?

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.066
Yes, Dumon, what is it?

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.603
Alito, you must travel to
the human's world immediately!

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:40.307
We need you to retrieve
the Numbers located there!

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.544
But why do I have
to be the one?

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.279
Send someone else
on this mission.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.581
I have no desire
to assume human form

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.715
with all their limits.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.751
Plus my dueling skills
would be completely

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.386
squandered on their world!

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.656
I have chosen you, Alito.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:56.757
I will go then, Dumon.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.392
Since you are so insistent.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.129
Remember, Barian World
is depending on you!

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.332
I promise I will not fail!

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:09.403
For all our sakes,
I hope you are right.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.372
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.074
Yuma Tsukumo must be defeated.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.743
Our world desperately
needs those Numbers.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:17.411
Why send Alito?

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:21.148
He only cares about himself
and he's far too impulsive.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.750
Mizar, I know what I'm doing.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.421
We need an expert duelist
for this mission and Alito

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.089
is certainly one of our best.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:33.594
His competitive nature
will be a great advantage.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.461
Do not fear.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.665
Yuma Tsukumo's Numbers

What a voice, what sweet music.

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:14.761
She's so good!

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.762
Hey!

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:21.368
Girag... I didn't know
you were a music fan.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.169
Who are you!

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.305
What, you don't
you recognize me?

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:29.342
I forgot we never met
in this form before.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:33.513
You asked for it, kid,
and you're gonna get it!

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.760
No human could match
my moves that way...

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.761
Alito!

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:48.762
It's you!

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.697
It's been a long time!

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.766
(Alito)
But it seems you haven't
changed a bit.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.035
Even though you look
very different now,

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:56.737
you're still a slacker!

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.672
I'm just takin' a break.

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.408
Yeah, well you've been taking
it too easy, which is why

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.644
I was sent here to get
the mission back on track.

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.681
You won't be any more
successful than me!

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.483
Of course I will,
because I'll keep

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:10.751
all my focus on dueling!

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:14.221
I'm not gonna get
distracted like you!

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:18.658
While you keep failing,
I'll get it done!

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.029
(indistinct conversation)

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.699
This mission is a total
waste of my time.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.468
I'm supposed to be collecting
Numbers, but I can only use

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.670
these pathetic
humans to get them.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.741
I guess I won't be
doing any dueling here.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.743
Oh, well!

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.615
Hey, watch out!

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.750
Oops, sorry!

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.289
Are you okay?

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:07.240
I must be dreaming!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.547
Hey, Girag...

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.751
Do you believe "love at
first sight" is real?

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.753
Because I know it is.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:23.490
It just happened to me!

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:27.561
Girag, I don't know
who that girl is,

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.062
but I'm going to win her heart.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:33.767
I'll use my classic
"counter" strategy!

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.970
This counter?

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:43.443
That math quiz was super easy!

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.747
You're the one I bumped
into yesterday.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:49.749
I wanted to apologize.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.750
Please forgive me.

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:54.254
<i>Step one: start by</i>
turning up the heat.

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:55.589
That's okay.

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:56.256
It was my fault.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:59.759
<i>Then counter your first</i>
impression by playing it cool.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.529
Heads down, dudettes!

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:06.066
You'll never catch
up to me now!

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:06.766
Who's that?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:10.136
(Yuma)
Don't be so
sure, Bronk!

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.744
Watch where you're going!

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.312
Catch you later, Tori!

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.748
Bronk, hold up,
that was interference!

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.751
Hey, wait for me!

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.488
Tori...

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.556
(boy) Marco!

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.557
(boy) Polo!

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.524
(boy) Marco!

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.193
(Alito) Hey there!

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:36.062
How's it goin'?

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:40.367
<i>Step two, use the unexpected</i>
to catch her off guard.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.635
Quit goofing around!

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:44.738
You could get hurt!

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.240
<i>Now that I've got</i>
her attention,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.076
<i>I'll give her a scare!</i>

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.747
<i>She'll be completely</i>
defenseless

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.451
<i>as I unleash one of my</i>
most disarming lines.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.622
You should be more careful.

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.190
It was actually your fault.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.693
I was so dazzled by
your gorgeous eyes,

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:09.696
that it threw off my balance!

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:13.233
My eyes... really?

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:19.172
(Yuma)
Let's do a double-dive!

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.340
C'mon Ray!

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.075
Time to high-five
the sky!

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.678
Don't make me!

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.447
Heads up!

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:31.017
Hey, look out!

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:38.525
(Alito) Excuse me, Tori?

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:41.528
I believe you dropped this.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:42.762
That doesn't belong to me.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:46.766
<i>Step three: win her heart</i>
with the perfect compliment!

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:47.767
That's strange.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.736
I was sure it had fallen
from one of your wings

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.540
since you're
such an "angel."

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:04.751
Cover your mouth!

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.587
Sorry!

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.222
Wait, where're we going now?

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.759
(Tori)
Get back here,
you hear me?

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:17.097
(Girag)
Your strategy
didn't work?

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.498
No!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:22.168
Maybe you need to come up with
a different strategy, Alito.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.104
No, I'm sure it would've
worked if that

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:26.506
other kid hadn't
kept interfering.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.675
It was like he was
trying to sabotage me

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.744
every step of the way!

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:34.014
Sounds like you got a rival.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.750
And in that case, there's
only one thing you can do.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.386
You've gotta prove to
her that you're better

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:40.754
than this other guy.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.757
Challenge him to
a no-holds-barred,

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:44.524
one-on-one duel.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.761
Show her that you're a winner
and she'll fall for you.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.096
You may be on to
something, Girag.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.564
Listen, your problem is solved

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.733
if you just do this one thing.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.001
Win!

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:58.271
Now fuel up for your duel!

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:02.675
I will duel, and win!

00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.479
Hey!

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:09.749
A note?

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:10.283
Huh...

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.752
"Meet me on the roof
to duel for Tori."

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.387
Hey, who is that from?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.723
Where'd you come from?

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.060
Morning, I'm glad
to see you too!

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:32.505
Hi.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.175
Look, I got a note that
says you're challenging me

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:38.344
to a duel over Tori, but
I'm sure it's a joke!

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.146
My note was serious
and I demand

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.148
an answer from you right now!

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:45.985
Do you accept my
challenge or no?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.022
If you refuse, Tori
will realize I am

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:51.391
the only one who is
truly worthy of her!

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.127
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:57.997
But I never turn down
the chance to duel!

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.737
Duel Disk, go!

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.745
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:19.152
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established!

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:21.354
Let's duel!

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:26.392
Let's duel!

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.461
I'll get us started!

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.530
I draw!

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.765
<i>Whatever card I pick</i>
should help me take charge

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:36.269
<i>of this duelright</i>
from the start.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.736
<i>I know!</i>

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:41.608
First I summon Battlin'
Boxer Headgeared!

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.413
Great!

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:51.518
And next I'm going to activate
spell card Ring Announcer!

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:54.120
Now the sparring can
really get started,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.522
'cause this spell
lets me summon

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:58.758
another of my Battlin'
Boxer monsters!

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:05.098
In my corner, it's
Battlin' Boxer Glassjaw!

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.738
I'm far from done, cause,

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:17.277
I now I overlay
Headgeared and Glassjaw!

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:22.649
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:28.755
I Xyz Summon Battlin'
Boxer Lead Yoke!

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:39.232
I've handled tougher
Xyz monsters than that.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:40.767
You should be extra cautious.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:41.734
What do you mean?

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.571
I am sensing that there
is something different

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:47.440
about this opponent.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.274
<i>No!</i>

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.676
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.744
<i>That must be... Astral!</i>

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.481
<i>He's the one who came</i>
from Astral World.

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.650
<i>And that can only</i>
mean one thing.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.754
<i>That kid is Yuma Tsukumo!</i>

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:07.026
I'll place two cards facedown.

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.127
It's your move!

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:13.132
<i>This duel should be more</i>
interesting than I expected!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.767
It's my turn!

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:15.535
I draw!

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:19.739
I'll start off by
summoning Gagaga Magician.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.043
And I'll follow
it up by activating

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:27.447
my spell Blustering Winds!

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.750
This spell packs
the force of a hurricane,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.087
boosting my monster's
attack points by a thousand!

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.689
And it's all heading your way!

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.758
Work your magic, Gagaga!

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.226
Blast Lead Yoke!

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.361
Quick, Lead Yoke!

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.630
Use your special ability now!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.199
It can use an Overlay
Unit to shield itself

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:49.435
from being KO'd in battle!

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:51.237
What?

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:55.008
But that won't protect
you from damage!

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.350
You call that an attack?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.521
I forgot to mention Lead Yoke's
other special ability!

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.423
Whenever it loses
Overlay Units,

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:14.727
Lead Yoke gains 800
attack points!

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:20.767
As I feared, this monster is
not to be taken lightly, Yuma.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.369
Guess I'll have
to end my turn.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.605
Which means I draw!

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:29.742
Straightaway, I'll activate
my spell Mano a Mano!

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.544
If I were you,
I'd brace myself!

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:35.248
If either of us takes damage in
battle, this spell increases

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:38.084
that damage by
a thousand points!

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:42.422
Now Lead Yoke, Ko
Gagaga Magician!

00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:43.756
I won't be pulling any punches,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.293
'cause I want you to
throw in the towel!

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.029
(Alito)
I won't be pulling
any punches,

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.166
'cause I want you to
throw in the towel!

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.535
Throw in the towel?

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:06.245
You had enough, or should
we go another round?

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.113
You know it.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:10.750
You're up now, but I'm gonna
be the last man standing!

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.753
You've got spirit even
if you are gonna lose!

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:17.323
Except I'm not gonna lose!

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:21.594
To start my comeback,
I'll summon Dododo Warrior!

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.563
I don't need to tribute
to summon this monster,

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:27.467
because I'm going to lower
its attack points by 500!

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.235
After that, I'll
activate a spell

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.238
to bring back my Magician!

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:35.041
I play Monster Reborn!

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.410
Gagaga has an awesome
trick up its sleeve.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.748
Once per turn, it can change
its Level between one and eight,

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:44.751
so I'm switching
its Level to six.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:48.721
Now I overlay my Level
six Dododo Warrior

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.756
and Gagaga Magician!

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:54.761
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:59.499
I Xyz Summon a monster
that's packed with power...

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.100
Gauntlet Launcher!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.737
Then I'll activate Gauntlet
Launcher's special ability!

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.039
By using an Overlay Unit,
it can destroy

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:10.243
one monster on the field!

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:10.743
No way!

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:13.713
I could never block that!

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:17.049
Unless of course,
I play this...

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:19.218
the trap Xyz Block!

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:23.756
All I have to do is remove an
Overlay Unit from my Xyz Monster

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:29.462
and then Xyz Block negates your
monster's special ability!

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.031
Yuma, I am afraid this monster

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.767
presents us with
a serious challenge.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:41.007
Every time Lead Yoke loses an
Overlay Unit it grows stronger!

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:49.215
That monster has muscles
on its muscles!

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:53.152
This will require you to
rethink your strategy.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:57.757
I'll put two cards facedown
and then end my turn!

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.760
Sure thing!

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.297
You can finish them
off now, Lead Yoke.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:07.233
Go ahead and attack
Gauntlet Launcher!

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:12.238
Charge full speed ahead
and pummel it into oblivion!

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:15.741
I activate the trap
Battle Rush!

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:19.745
This trap prevents your
monster from being destroyed,

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:23.182
and he takes any damage
that you would have taken.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:25.751
Well played, Yuma.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.753
I expected that!

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.387
What?

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.089
With my incredible
"counter" strategy,

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:32.725
I can block practically
any move you try!

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:35.761
I activate my Fancy
Footwork trap card!

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:39.765
Any trap you activate
in battle is destroyed,

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.168
so it's bye-bye
Battle Rush!

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.738
Now, go for the victory
blow, Lead Yoke!

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.975
The damage you take will
be increased substantially

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:51.444
by his spell Mano a Mano.

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:54.514
You will be down
to 100 life points.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.549
Not if I use Xyz Strike!

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.018
You cannot Yuma,
that is too risky!

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.454
I have no choice!

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:06.759
If it works, my trap
will counter his trap!

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.161
I have to draw one
card from my deck.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.330
If it's a monster card,
then the two monsters

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.165
battling will swap
attack points,

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.968
then the attack points
of my opponent's monster

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.570
get zeroed out!

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.739
Yes, but the damage
you take will be doubled

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:22.308
if the card you draw
is not a monster!

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:26.679
I have to take the chance
or I don't deserve to win!

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.047
Yuma!

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:32.485
I'm feeling the flow!

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.423
Oh, yeah!

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.058
A monster card!

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:44.063
Gauntlet Launcher, bash
him with a Turbo Jab!

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:01.247
I won?

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.149
I'm amazing!

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:06.752
Thank you, thank you!

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:12.725
He was prepared to utilize the
spell card Flaming Knockout!

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:16.195
If Yuma had not used his trap
card to destroy Lead Yoke,

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.230
then his opponent's spell
card Flaming Knockout

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.334
could have been activated
and dealt him damage equal

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:25.271
to his own monster's
attack points!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.276
If that was the case,
then Yuma would certainly

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.410
have lost the duel.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.746
It seems that whenever
Yuma finds himself

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.181
backed into a corner,

00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.316
he always believes he
will find a way to

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.218
"high five the sky"...

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:42.722
I am glad when he does not
fall flat on his face.

00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:45.324
Best win of all time!

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.160
(Tori) Yuma!

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:49.629
Tori!

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.163
What's wrong?
Sorry, Yuma.

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:53.466
I didn't mean to blab
about the note to Tori,

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.169
but I'm afraid that keeping
secrets is not exactly

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.138
the Ray way.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.740
I can't believe it, Yuma!

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:05.311
Are you really dueling over me?

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.445
Over you?

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:07.747
(Alito) Yuma Tsukumo!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.584
I can't believe
you defeated me!

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:14.053
Not by much, though.

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:16.455
Still...

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.592
Look, it's no big deal.

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:24.330
If we dueled again, it
could turn out differently.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.765
No, enough!

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:29.435
I don't want you dueling
over me anymore!

00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:32.405
Excuse me.

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:33.739
Oh, well.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.574
That was amazing!

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:36.742
What?

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:39.345
I thought this duel
would be easy!

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.746
What a mistake!

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:43.416
Oh by the way,
my name's Alito.

00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:45.484
Remember that name
'cause you and I are

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:50.056
gonna be dueling a lot, Yuma!

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:51.023
What's wrong?

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.759
You don't wanna duel more?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.130
Of course I do!

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.600
Hey!

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.336
What about me?

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:06.539
(Yuma)
I'm winning our
next duel, too!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.042
(Alito)
The only thing you're
winning is a one way ticket

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.210
to Loser World!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.345
(Yuma) Oh, yeah?
