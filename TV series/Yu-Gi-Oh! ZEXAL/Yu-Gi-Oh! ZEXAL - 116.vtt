and flipped some cards for a box
of old stained glass.

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:21.794

together and I made this...

you build it here, Flip?

be able to come to and think

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:30.770
about all the good
times we had with Astral.

important, Bronk.

remember and move on.

not the way Yuma did.

And I couldn't always see or
talk to Astral like Yuma could.

he wasn't my friend.

Yuma, the card is so powerful

that it can determine
the fate of every world.

00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:28.453
We believe that Barian World
and Astral World

00:10:28.453 --> 00:10:30.722

gets it first,

destroy Astral World.

We need to get it

without Astral.

You and I both know

the ancient ruins on purpose.

and send you there.

the stored energy

00:14:36.802 --> 00:14:39.871

one shot to open the portal.

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:55.187

But, sir I...
Just do as I tell you!

(Quinton)
He won't get near the teleporter
till you're through the portal.

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:10.896
We'll both make sure of that.

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:15.433
Okay, thanks guys.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.435
(chuckling) So be it.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.906
I'll take you two
down first then!

00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:24.442
(gasping)

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:28.747
In this field,
my life points are doubled

00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:31.383
and your life points
are halved.

00:16:31.383 --> 00:16:33.451
Like that's gonna help you.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.319
Let's do this.

00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:38.190
I'm going to love taking
the two of you down.

00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:48.767
I can't wait to
get under your skin!

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:50.702
(laughing)

00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:53.405
Somebody call pest control.

00:16:53.405 --> 00:16:56.308
(Yuma) Quinton, use this!

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.445
This was <i>my</i> Number Card.

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:02.714
I figured it might
come in handy.

00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:06.218
I appreciate the card
and I'm positive that it will.

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:09.454
I have to admit, I never thought
the day would come when we'd be

00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:11.456
dueling together
like this, Kite.

00:17:11.456 --> 00:17:14.960
Just do the best you can
to keep up with me, Quinton.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.460
Keep up with you?

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.064
If it wasn't for me
you wouldn't know how to duel.

00:17:19.064 --> 00:17:22.400
The student frequently
outshines the master.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.171
Then I think we should be able
to squash this mosquito.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:29.374
Go Photon Transformation!

00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:34.446
We're going to swat you down!

00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:35.146
This, I promise!

00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:39.451
(Kaninja)
You shouldn't make promises you
know you can't keep.

00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:41.286
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:47.459
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.395
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:53.431
My turn, I draw!

00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:57.769
First, I summon
Deep-Space Cruiser IX.

00:18:02.841 --> 00:18:07.345
Then I activate
the spell Hologram Projection.

00:18:07.979 --> 00:18:09.447
This lets me make a hologram

00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:12.450
of my
Deep-Space Cruiser IX

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.919
so now I have two.

00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:21.459
Yeah!

00:18:21.459 --> 00:18:23.161
Way to start the duel!

00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:26.731
I overlay my two
Deep-Space Cruisers.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.168
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network.

00:18:30.168 --> 00:18:33.438
I Xyz Summon the Number that
Yuma gave back to me...

00:18:33.438 --> 00:18:36.441
Number Nine, Dyson Sphere.

00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:49.821
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:52.223
I can assure you that
try as you might,

00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:53.992
my monster will not fall.

00:18:53.992 --> 00:18:56.961
But you however,
will not be as fortunate.

00:18:56.961 --> 00:18:58.763
Time to take you down.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:18:59.764
My turn.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:00.865
I draw.

00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:04.102
First I summon Photon Thrasher!

00:19:08.907 --> 00:19:12.043
Next, I summon
Photon Chargeman!

00:19:12.043 --> 00:19:14.045
And I think I'll charge
it up right away

00:19:14.045 --> 00:19:17.382
by doubling its attack points.

00:19:17.382 --> 00:19:19.084
I tribute my Photon Thrasher

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:24.189
and Chargeman to summon
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:19:28.693 --> 00:19:30.362
(roaring)

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.200
It's your move, bug boy!

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.436
Dyson Sphere
and Galaxy-Eyes,

00:19:38.436 --> 00:19:40.305
just where I want them.

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.439
(laughing)

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:43.808
My turn, I draw!

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.244
I summon Mosquito Force!

00:19:46.244 --> 00:19:47.879
But I'm not done.

00:19:47.879 --> 00:19:50.448
I'm gonna add reinforcements.

00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:53.151
You see Mosquito Force's
special ability

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:57.188
lets me add another
Mosquito Force to my hand.

00:19:57.188 --> 00:19:58.456
Next, I activate the spell

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.826
Ninjitsu Art of
Mosquito Marching.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.696
I can now summon two
Mosquito Forces

00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:06.097
to the frontline to

00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:09.134
strengthen my skeeter squadron!

00:20:11.436 --> 00:20:12.937
Three Level 2 monsters.

00:20:12.937 --> 00:20:14.773
I know what he's hatching.

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:15.907
I overlay three

00:20:15.907 --> 00:20:19.377
Level Two Mosquito Forces.

00:20:20.812 --> 00:20:22.347
With these three monsters,

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.015
I build the Overlay Network

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.451
and Xyz Summon Number Two

00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:29.120
Ninja Shadow Mosquito.

00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:43.435
Did it just disappear?

00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:46.337
What's this bug brain up to?

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:47.739
I don't see it.

00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:48.873
Do you?

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.308
No, It's gone!

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:51.209
I can assure you,

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:54.212
my mighty and magnificent
monster is here.

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.114
And you'll soon
learn the hard way

00:20:56.114 --> 00:20:59.083
