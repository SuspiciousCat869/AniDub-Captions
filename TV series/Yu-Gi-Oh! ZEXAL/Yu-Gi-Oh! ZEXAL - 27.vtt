00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.060
Yuma: Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.430
Mr. Heartland: Welcome
duelists to heartland city.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.330
Welcome to the
world Duel carnival!

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.260
Now then, here are the rules!

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.830
The field of play
is the entire city,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.930
and the first phase of this
tournament will last three days.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.660
During these three days, if
you are challenged to a duel,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.560
you must accept that challenge.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.090
How do you accept a challenge?

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.560
Simple: You will
Wager your heart piece.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.290
Lose your heart piece,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.030
and you lose your spot here.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.390
But if you win...

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.660
you win a heart piece!

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.390
Assemble All five pieces and
you'll have won a spot in the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060
tournament finals.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060
So let the duels begin!

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.930
TORI: Wonder who'll
make the first move?

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.030
Yeah,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.330
and who that person's
gonna challenge!

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.390
CROWD: What's his problem?

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.390
STRIKER: Outta my way!

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.330
Move it!

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.390
Since winning this tournament is
my goal, I'll let my soccer ball

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.560
pick my opponent.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.930
What's your problem?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.390
This is a duel tournament,
not a soccer match!

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.290
For me they're one and
the same. Now then,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.530
get up ball boy,
'cause we're duel

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530

Let's duel!

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.930
After All, this soccer
ball picked you!

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.930
Now there's no going back.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.030
Huh? Is this guy for real?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.130
Yeah I'm for real, and you're
in real trouble. Because if you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.560
think I have skills when
it comes to kickin' it,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.030
just wait till you see the moves
that I make out on the duel

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.260
field.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.560
Are those cards on there?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.690
Now,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.460
put up your heart
piece and let's go!

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.660
Aw Yeah!

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.260
I like your style,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.360
straight to business.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.060
Oh Hey, I'm yuma tsukumo.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460
Who are you?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.360
The name is striker.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.860
Caswell: Did he say striker?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.960
You know him?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.130
Maybe.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.090
That name sure
sounds familiar.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.390
[cheering]

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.990
man A: Alright, here we go!

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.090
Time to kick this carnival off!

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.430
Let's do this!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.460
Cuz I'm...

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.790
feeling the flow!

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.090
Duel Disk go!

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.990
Now, time to set my
sights on winning!

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.890
Duel gazer, let's roll!

Computer VOICE: Augmented

Together: Now let's duel!

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.930
Since you challenged,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.730
I'll make the first
move. I draw!

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.590
and it'll be a quick one. I'll
just play one monster facedown

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.060
in defense mode.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.630
Astral: Gogogo golem played
in defense mode?

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.060
Smart move.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.390
With all the trash talk our
fancy foot-Working friend was

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.690
kicking up, I figured you would
foolishly go on the attack.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.230
Clearly I am rubbing off on you.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.530
Ya know,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.230
if you keep taking the
credit I'll attack you!

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590
I don't know who you're
talking to over there,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.230
but I know that
after my first move,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.590
you won't be talking to anyone
cuz you're gonna be speechless.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.130
Here we go...

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.630
I draw!

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.960
Just what I was hoping, it's
the field spell card known as

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.030
stadium of dreams!

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.630
Huh?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.890
You're kiddin' me!

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.330
This is not my look.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.630
Cathy: So cool!

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.190
It's like we're
at a soccer game!

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.630
Indeed it is, and it looks like
we're gonna be the ones calling

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.090
it in front of all
these fine people!

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.860
And If their cheers are any
sign, I'd say this stadium of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.890
dreams is their dream Come True!

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.660
[Cheering]

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.730
whoa! T-this can't be!

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.060
It can and it is.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.630
And there's more too, cuz now
stadium of dreams switches all

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.830
facedowns in defense
mode to faceup!

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.930
What?

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.530
But I'm not finished.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.560
Next I summon wing captain.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.660
Now captain, attack!

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.760
Just 1100 attack points?

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.760
Sorry but cappy's totally
outranked by gogogo!

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.230
Not once I activate the
spell card perfect pass!

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.290
Take it, wing captain!

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.360
And take it to gogogo golem!

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.090
Cuz Now, since golem's defense
points are greater than wing

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.330
captain's attack points, my
captain's attack points double!

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.890
You can double-Team golem all
you want but it won't matter,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.490
its special ability keeps it
from being destroyed in Battle

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.890
once per turn!

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.360
Oh didn't I mention?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.230
Perfect Pass negates your
monster's special ability!

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.660
What?

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.430
Can you say,
gogogo-Goaaaaallll!

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.890
[Screaming]

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.860
SCOREBOARD: Gooooal!

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.460
No fair!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.260
When you destroy a monster in
defense mode, it's not supposed

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.990
to take away any life points!

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.530
It does when cappy's attack
points are greater than your

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.160
monster's defense points.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.490
Don't ya just love
captain's special ability?

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.730
You know what I'd love?

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.160
To last more than one
round with this guy!

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.260
I'm ending my turn
with a facedown.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.230
Your draw yuma, if you dare!

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.590
Fight on, yuma!

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.860

us to cheer you on!

all believe in you!

If they do,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.490
then I believe too.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.560
Alright,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.160
I draw!

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.190
Nice!

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.990
I summon gagaga magician!

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.460
Now Let's kick it, gagaga!

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.430
Attack Wing captain!

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.890
Great coaching!

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.460
Gagaga Magician has 1500 attack
points and wing captain's attack

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.190
points are back to normal,
so this is a mismatch!

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.660
Alright, yuma!

Nice Play, yuma!

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.360
That last goal is negated.

Negated?

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.460
How come?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.760
I smell a trap card.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.990
And it stinks!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.590
Tough luck yuma, but as you can

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.590
see, I've activated my
facedown card, offside trap.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.030
I see now.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.930
And you're about to see wing
captain Come back too, because

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.790
with this card, my monster isn't
destroyed and I also take no

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.330
damage, plus your turn
comes to an end.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.390
What?

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.030

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.760
No way.

thinking man's game; you should

Your best?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.930
Is that what you call
those weak moves?

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.730
It's my turn!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.330

summoning out top scorer!

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.190
How did he summon a level 5
monster without a tribute?

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.160
Yeah, you're so not
allowed to do that!

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.930
Ha, I am when the field spell
stadium of dreams is out.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.930
It lets me summon top scorer
without tributing another

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.030
monster!

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.460
No fair!

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.560
Now go ahead and strike
away, top scorer!

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.060
Attack Gagaga magician!

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.660
And with your defense
now in disarray,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.960
I'll take shot Number two!

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.360
Wing Captain, attack!

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.130
Goal!

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.460
Yuma!

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.860
I can't watch anymore!

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.960
Guess what?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.230
I'm not done!

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.930
Next I activate a spell card,

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.530
and it's an eyeful too.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.930
Eye contact!

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.090
Don't blink, cuz now offside
trap returns to my hand!

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.490
Next I place one
card facedown,

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.790
and end my turn!

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.630
This is some game plan Striker
has come up with. If that

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.560
facedown he just threw is
another offside Trap, that means

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.390
he'll stop any attack I make and

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.590
then my turn will be over.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.430
Hey, are you even listening?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.030
Of course I am listening, yuma.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.430
So what do you think?

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.360
I think you summed it up well.
Things seem quite hopeless.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.560
That's your advice?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.960
Things are hopeless?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.930
Thanks a ton coach, way
to build up my confidence here!

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.860
Oh Yes, you know it's over!

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.290
My sick skills have
you completely covered!

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.730
And there's not a thing
you can do about it, yuma!

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.960
CROWD: Ah! Dempsey!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.260
Man C: Amazing!

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.330
Oh my!

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.160
It's Dempsey and Donovan,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.090
the quick kicking brothers
Who play for heartland United!

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.660
But why are they here?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.330
Wait just a minute, now I know

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.560
why striker's name
was so familiar.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.290
It's because he's related
to Dempsey and Donovan.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.690
He's their kid brother!

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.290
And Third son...

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.530
to world-Class
coach Keller crossit!

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.260
Talk about a family with
Some serious soccer skills.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Together, they've won
more championships

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.060
than anyone out there!

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.760
So if you're such a soccer stud,
why are you here in a duel

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.790
tournament?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.160
I'll tell you why!

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.460
Cuz I'm nothing like my two
brothers or my father!

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.430
Do you two hear that?

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.860
I'm a duelist, not a soccer
player because in a duel,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.030
there's no passing or assists.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.690
It's all about getting
the job done yourself!

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.290
Somewhere, somebody once said
there's no 'I' in the word team.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.560
Well, in dueling,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.660
the word 'team' doesn't exist,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.330
and I like it that way!

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.830
What are you talking about?

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.060
Dueling is all about team work.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.960
What are you doing, yuma?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.930
I'm setting striker
Straight, that's what.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.260
Dueling's all about
working together!

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.690
Aw, gimme a break!

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.130
Think about IT: Wing
captain and top scorer?

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.430
They're not just monsters,
they're your teammates!

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.830
At least, that's always been the

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.360
way I look at the
monsters I summon out.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.260
For that matter, how I look
at every card in my deck!

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.330
All your cards?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.860
Teammates?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.960
Focus, yuma.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.190
It is our turn to draw now.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.360
Oh Yeah.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.730
Hold on, why are you
suddenly so anxious to draw?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.390
Because of you, yuma.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.790
That speech you gave
has given me an idea.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.760
To win!

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.830
Time to put on your rally cap

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.760
yuma, because it
is comeback time.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.360
I don't have a cap!

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.430
But I'm all for the rally!

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.490
My turn,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.790
draaaaw!

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.930
And now...

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.760
I summon zubaba Buster.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.960
Would you please not
interrupt meeee!

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.560
I summon zubaba Buster!

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.430
Then I will use the spell card
monster reborn to summon back to

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.160
the field gogogo golem!

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.360
Hey,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.760
you're stealing all my lines!

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.660
Now Now, just consider this part
of the whole teamwork thing!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.030
Yeah, but you forget, astral
no one can see or hear you.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.060
Next up I'm activating the
spell card monster reborn!

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.590
And I'll use it to bring back
gogogo golem in defense mode!

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.130
Fine with me, because nothing
you bring out can possibly beat

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.060
my offside trap!

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.060
Hate to say it, but
he's gotta point there.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.690
Maybe, but you have
got something better.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.390
Activate the spell card cross
attack from your hand.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.430
Do it now.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.760
Of course!

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.430
I activate the spell
card cross attack!

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.790
Now since we have two monsters
on the field with the same

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.290
number of attack
points, one of

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.860
them can attack
striker directly!

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.630
Goal!

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.530
He scored a goal on me!

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.660
Go Yuma go!

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.030
Go Yuma go!

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.330
Yeah!

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.590
What a dazzling display!

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.890
You can say that again!

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.460
In fact, I'll say it for you.
What a dazzling display!

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.930
Alright.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.530
So you found out offside trap
can't activate against Direct

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.560
attacks!

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.730
Big deal!

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.190
It is a big deal.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.560
After all yuma, not only does
striker now take damage from

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.690
zubaba Buster's attack, But the
monster with the fewest attack

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.590
points on his field
is also destroyed.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.090
Sure, zubaba Buster pays a
penalty of 800 attack points

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.860
when it uses this ability, but
that is a small price to pay to

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.690
destroy a monster.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.360
Wait just a minute,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.190
here's another card I can use.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.890
And I'll use it now!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.130
I play the spell extra blast!

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.790
Since a special ability
destroyed your monster, you take

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.660
500 points of damage.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.260
It's all tied up now!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.960
Yuma's right back
in this thing!

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.960
Way to go, yuma!

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.030
Ya See?

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.130
That's what teamwork
can do for ya!

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.060
Now to end my turn,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.530
I'll throw this!

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.690
And I'll throw up if ya
keep talking teamwork!

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.260
I've never believed in it!

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.390
Here, come on,

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.530
I'm open!

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.590
Pass it!

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.090
Now look what you did,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.590
you should've kicked it to me!

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.960
We might lose cause of you!

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.330
Cause of you all!

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.590
What's with him?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.790
i'll just have to
win all by myself!

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.790
Teammate a: I'm open!

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.660
Teammate B: Striker,
come on, pass it here!

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.090
why, so you can mess it up?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.160
no way.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.360
i got this.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.930
Opponent a: He's Dempsey
and Donovan's Younger bro?

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.860
Opponent B: You wouldn't know
it from his soccer skills.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.790
I guess we all know who was born
with Two left feet in that

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.660
family now, don't we guys?

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.260
Hey, are you okay, striker?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.730
I'm fine!

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.160
It's all you guys
that are the problem!

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.730
This was all your fault!

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.060
DONOVAN: That's enough, striker!

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.460
The Truth is that
you're the one to blame.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.190
Dempsey: And if you don't see
why, then you don't have any

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.030
business being here.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.630
It was on that day that
I turned my back on soccer.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.490
And vowed to show my brothers
that I was right. That I could

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.890
be a champion without
anyone's help!

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.990
So here I am yuma,
doing exactly that!

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.030
And no one is going to
stop me, especially not you!

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.290
Well you know what?

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.390
You're wrong!

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.690
Maybe I will stop you,
maybe I won't.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.290
But just take a
look at your deck.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.460
You haven't turned
your back on soccer,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.190
it's still your passion!

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.990
I mean,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.090
every card you have just
flat out screams it!

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.730
That's not True,
I'm over soccer now!

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.330
Yet here we are dueling
on a soccer field.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.190
That was formed with your card.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.660
Come on, it's okay to admit it.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.530
You still love
the game, don't ya?

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.630
Do I?

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.890
Uh...

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.460
guess I do have
some soccer cards...

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.930
it... it...

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.230
it's my turn!

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.890
Here goes!

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.930
Perfect!

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.290
Uh Oh...

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.630
straight from my hand, I'm
summoning defending sweeper!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.990
And when stadium of dreams
is on the field,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.430
it gains one full level!

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.990
But I'm not done yet, I may not
believe in team work, but I

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.490
believe in this card,
the spell all for one!

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.530
and there's another!

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.590
These are all soccer
themed duel cards!

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.790
And they could
mean the end of us.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.360
Since there are two monsters on
the field with the same type and

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.260
level, all for one allows
striker to summon an additional

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.830
monster from his graveyard so

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.090
long as it is the same
type as the other two.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.790
Suit up wing captain,
you're back in play!

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.990
But not only does all for one
bring the captain back, it also

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.360
lets me give him
one extra level!

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.360
So now he has
three level 5 monsters?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.830
But that means...

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.160
that means I can now overlay
level 5 top Scorer, defending

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.630
sweeper and wing captain!

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.360
And now that the overlay
network has been created,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.790
I can xyz summon!

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.830
Come on out playmaker!

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.660
2600 attack points?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.760
Oh No, that's enough to

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.590
eliminate yuma from
the duel carnival!

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.260
Come on out playmaker!

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.630
2600 attack points?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.760
Oh No, that's enough to

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.930
eliminate yuma from
the duel carnival!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.690
Now playmaker,
attack zubaba Buster!

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.460
Yuma, you have a trap to play!

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.090
You bet I do astral, and
I'm gonna play it right now!

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.130
I activate half unbreak!

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.230
Go!

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.490
Now Zubaba Buster
won't get busted,

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.460
so go ahead and do your worst!

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.990
And the best part
of half unbreak,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.490
it cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.590
Well more Damage
is coming your way!

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.490
I activate playmaker's ability!

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.590
Now, by using One overlay Unit,
playmaker's allowed to attack

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:57.490
again, and this time, it's gonna
take on your strongest monster!

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.090
Go ahead, cuz my strongest
monster is gogogo golem and like

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.360
I told ya before, it can
withstand one attack per turn!

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.330
I'll just attack it again then.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.490
And I think I'll use
my final overlay unit

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.460
for one more attack!

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:35.090
Zubaba Buster's the only one
left, so attack it playmaker!

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.330
I don't think so striker, cause
half unbreak is still in play!

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.960
Goal!

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.030
Yuma, no!

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.090
It's cool, Tori.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.290
I'm fine.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.690
Actually, I'm not just
fine, I'm great!

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.230
And Ya know why, striker?

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.660
Cuz I'm winning!

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.530
What are you talking
about, you're winning?

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.930
I just blasted
your monsters and

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.990
you only have 100
life points left!

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.090
Yeah, that's True,

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.590
but when you believe
in your teammates,

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.530
you're always winning.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.730
Now then,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.730
my turn!

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.960
Draw!

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.490
I'm summoning gagaga girl!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.460
Just 1000 attack points?

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.460
How on earth is that
gonna help you...

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.730
now Yuma's got
two level 3's out.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.530
Well done, yuma!

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.590
Now you can summon
an xyz monster!

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.760
Yeah!

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.560
That's what happens when
ya believe, so go now,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.230
I overlay level 3 zubaba
Buster and gagaga girl!

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.090
And Now, with the overlay
network in full effect, I'm

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.930
gonna full on xyz summon!

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.690
And as you're about to see, this
monster really hits the right

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.430
chord!

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.990
Behold, muzurhythm
the string djinn!

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.430
Next I activate the equip spell
giant Hunter and equip it onto

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.960
muzurhythm.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.430
Talk about a tune up.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.860
Nice work, yuma.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.430
Now striker cannot use spell or
Trap cards until the battle is

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.590
over this turn!

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.160
Wait, but that means I'm not
allowed to use offside trap!

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.490
That's right, and when a monster
equipped with Giant Hunter

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.460
attacks, if I have fewer life
points than you, your monster's

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.730
attack points are cut in half!

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.830
Aw, there goes my offense.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.960
Next I activate

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.290
muzurhythm the string
djinn's ability!

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.990
Now, by using One overlay unit,
when muzurhythm battles your

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.690
xyz, it's attack
points are doubled.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.330
Talk about strumming up a storm.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.290
Finish him, muzurhythm!

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.090
Goal!

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.730
Gooooalll!

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.790
Yuma Comes from behind
with an unbelievable finish!

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.660
Alright Yuma,
way to go, hooray!

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.790
Three Cheers for yuma!

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.230
You did it, yuma.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.630
You won.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.760
Yeah, but I couldn't have
done it without my teammate.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.190
Thanks astral.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.590
[laughing]

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.890
huh?

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.930
What gives?

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.690
What gives is you were right!

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.290
I haven't turned my back on
soccer, it's still my passion.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.960
But it took this duel
to realize that.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.990
Awesome.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.330
And by watching you yuma,

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.460
I learned something else.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.590
Teamwork.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.530
I finally saw how
it really works.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.230
Is that so, striker?

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.490
Then maybe it's time
you return to the pitch.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.460
And be part of our team, bro.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.730
Do you really mean it?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.230
We sure do, striker.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.530
After all,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.390
we're family, and that's
the closest team of them all.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.390
I realize that now.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.260
And I promise you both
that I'll never forget it.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.390
So ya lost But ya won, too.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.760
Yeah...

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.060
but you're always winning when
you believe in your teammates.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.060
I can't thank you enough, yuma.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.960
I'm sure you'll be a
soccer champion in no time.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.430
And you, a duel champion.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.960
All right!

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.790
I won my first heart piece!

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.390
But I'll need more than that,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.090
to reach the finals
I'll need all five!

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.160
So watch out everybody!
