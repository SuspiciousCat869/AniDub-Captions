Yuma: Last time on
Yu-gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.060
My first fan mail. I'm so
excited, I can't wait to see it!

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.560
Haha! Hey, this is a baby
tiragon Card just like the one

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.330
flip tried to give me.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.890
I can't believe I've
got an xyz monster!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.990
FLIP: Yes, indeed you do, yuma.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.990
And I've got you right
where I want ya.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.660
I'll summon Forth Baby tiragon!

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.330
Thanks to ultra c, when baby

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.430
tiragon is summoned
out to your field,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.560
I can summon one xyz monster
straight from your deck!

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.030
Which means...
utopia is all mine!

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.260
ASTRAL: Flip planned this
from the very start.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.430
Ah! So then that card
sent by you?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.530
That's right. And
that note on your back

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.730
tells you what
we're dueling for.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.290
If I lose this duel,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.260
I agree to give flip
a card from my deck.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.630
Which card of mine is it
that we're playing for?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.630
Why the card you beat shark with
of course,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.460
your utopia card!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.160
Utopia is a number card.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.930
If yuma loses that, then
I too shall be lost.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930
Now ultra C,
activate!

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.330
And with your power, I summon
utopia from yuma's deck!

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.160

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.790
is now under my control.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.990
And utopia stays with me as long
as it's equipped with Ultra c.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.130
There's no way you can stop me.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.630
Victory will be mine and so will
your precious utopia card!

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.030
Ugh, I can't believe flip
tricked me into this jam.

whoa, you okay?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.630
No yuma, I'm not okay...

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.290
I feel much, much
better than okay.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.230
What on earth is going on?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.590
Something... taking over...

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.330
Eerie Voice: Yes, let
the number take hold.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.860
[screaming]

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.290
it seems flip has been
infected by a number.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.060
By a number?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.490
[Eerie Giggling]

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.730
whoa - 39.
That's utopia's number.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.160
This isn't good.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.830
Astral!

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.230
My... my body.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.390
What's going on? What's
happening to you?

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.590
In a duel where number
cards are used,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.290
the Winner absorbs
the loser's number cards.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.830
And if I recall correctly,
if that happens,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.390
it means bad news
for astral.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.030
Quit talking to yourself.
After all,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.030
we have a duel to finish.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.330
Yeah, and the stakes have never
been higher. If I'm gonna

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.960
stand a chance, I'm gonna need
to take down utopia. But to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
beat a number monster, I need a
number monster. Good thing I

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.330
have TWO: Leviathan Dragon and
terror-Byte. Problem is,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.930
right now level 4 gagaga and
level 2 full elf won't help me

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.660
in summoning either of them.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.490
so that means,
i've got no other choice...

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.630
I end my turn.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.490
Given up already, yuma?

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.290
Let me show ya how a
Winner duels.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.930
Watch and... learn!

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.730
I think I'll start things off
with a bang. Actually,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.530
make that a slash!
Utopia, attack full elf!

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.360
Looks like I've just taken the
lead in life points.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.230
And I aim to keep it!

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.260
I now place a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.390
There, that's how ya take a
turn with some talent.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.830
Why don't you try it again?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.360
Careful What ya wish
for, flip. Here goes!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.390
Perfect! This card should
get my duel motor runnin'.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.790
I summon level 3 rai Rider!

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.730
[Engine REVVING]

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.030
next I activate
gagaga's ability!

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.890
Which means, this
card's level

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.690
can change to a number between 1
and 8 until the end of the turn.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.390
So I'll be changing gagaga
magician to level 3,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.260
just like rai Rider, and you
know what that means...

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.060
I can overlay gagaga
magician and rai Rider.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.590
And now I'll use this overlay
network to summon out...

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.760
a mighty xyz!

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.590
So say hello to, number 17...

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.560
leviathan Dragon!

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.660
[Roaring]

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.490
number 17?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.890
So then I guess there
are a bunch of numbers.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.660
All the more for
me to snatch up.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.590
I activate the
trap card...

Whoa, what's going on now?

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.630
A fog is rolling in.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.590
And it's about to roll back your
life points, yuma. Because now,

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.760
I gain control of the monster
you just summoned!

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.230
Leviathan Dragon, no!

twice as bad for me.

behind all this?

looking for you.

already lost your mind.

so you can lose this duel too!

I'm not mean, the world is!

the hard way, yuma.

You see, I wasn't
always like this.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.430
Spencer?

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.430
He's not here.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.130
Well he's gotta be somewhere.
Let's keep looking.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.760
Spencer?

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.190
Spencer!

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.790
And so it began...

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.790
and the more I studied the way
of the flip side,

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.030
the more I learned.
It applied to everything.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.760
"And I took advantage. If my
enemies were pretending

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.530
to be nice but were truly mean,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.260
I would pretend to be
fair But would truly

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.630
cheat!"

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.890
[screaming]

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.560
"and it worked."

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.690
"I got all my cards back, and
something I didn't see coming...

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.360
respect.
Soon I developed all sorts of

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.260
different strategies
to get what I wanted

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.160
with my flip side method."

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.890
And without fail,
it always worked.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.630
I won at everything.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.990
Including Duels, where
winning matters the most!

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.890
But that's where
you're wrong, flip!

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.690
Dueling's not just
about winning.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.560
It's about having fun,
and doing the best you can do.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.890
You know who says things like
that, yuma?

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.990
Total losers like
you who never win.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.630
Any luck, bronk?

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.190
I got nothing.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.560
Aw, and we've looked
everywhere.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.230
Wait, did you go
to the old gym?

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.590
I thought you did.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.930
Let's move out.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.360
Spencer!

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:04.060
[Dominos clicking]

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.860
what do you want? I was
so close to Being finished!

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.430
Sorry Spencer, we didn't
mean to interrupt your uh...

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.390
your Uh, actually,
what exactly are you doing?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.190
I'm setting up dominos.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.890
Flip said he'd give me an xyz
monster if I spent all day in

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.060
here making this
line up for him.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.030
Together: Flip said that?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.530
Of course...

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.230
Flip Sent those photos out and
tricked Spencer into hiding out

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.660
here, so that Spencer wouldn't
be able to tell anyone

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.190
the toad photo's a fake!

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.290
But the question is why?

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.660
TOGETHER: A duel!

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.530
The only number monster I have
left is terror-Byte,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.260
and I can't waste any
time in summoning it.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.460
So it's a good thing I have the
spell release lease.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.160
Hopefully, it'll give me a new
lease on this duel.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.890
Cause with it, I can get rid of
a monster on my field, to add a

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.030
level 3 monster to my hand.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.630
Now let's get to it,
and release baby tiragon.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.490
Yuma, you must
protect Baby tiragon.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.890
Huh?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.860
It is our only hope.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.890
Astral, are you okay?

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.690
Protect Baby tiragon.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.390
But baby tiragon can't
defeat a number monster!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.790
Protect Tiragon...

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.390
[Whimpering]

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.830
alright, I'm switching baby
tiragon Into defense mode!

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.590
Then I'll place one card
facedown, and end my turn!

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.590
And it will be the last
card that you play.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.730
Cause now it's my turn.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.530
And that means you're...

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.840
through!

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.160
Where could yuma be?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.490
The only place we haven't
checked is the mall.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.960
I play leviathan
Dragon's ability!

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.390
And now yuma,

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.590
by using up one of
it's overlay units,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.590
leviathan gains
500 attack points!

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.390
Next, I'm going
to do a flip summon!

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.990
What's a flip summon?

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.060
I thought we'd been
over this yuma...

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.790
I can turn a monster that's
facedown

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.660
and in defense mode -
Face-up.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.860
Oh, and I can make it change
into attack mode as well.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.530
See for yourself.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.790
Rise, flipangutan!

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.560
Now to use flipangutan's
flip effect!

00:13:51.560 --> 00:14:01.030
It switches your monster from
defense mode to attack mode!

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.060
Oh No, so much for
protecting baby tiragon!

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.460
Now go,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.190
make that baby go boom,
leviathan Dragon!

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.190
Sonic Shredding stream!

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.490
I activate the trap
half unbreak!

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.930
But it gives me a big break,
cause now one monster

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.690
on my field can't be destroyed
this turn. Also, the damage from

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.660
your attack is cut in half!

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.630
So your trap protects
you from full damage.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.430
But if you recall, utopia has
2500 pounding attack points.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.760
So this attack is still gonna
pack a heavy punch!

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.760
So let him have it, utopia!

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.090
[Screaming]

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.330
but I'm not done yet.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.690
I'm now activating the spell
card book of flip!

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.790
With this card, I can now flip
flipangutan facedown.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.290
Which means I can use it's
special ability again.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.960
So if I switch baby
tiragon to defense mode,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.530
if flip attacks,
flipangutan's special ability

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.260
will change it back
to attack mode.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.090
And I'll be in big trouble.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.430
Bingo!

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.460
Also, you only have 300 life
points left.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.760
Which means,

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.390
as soon as it
becomes my turn again,

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.730
I'll be able to
take you out for good.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.360
And take your utopia!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.630
This is bad.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.590
Yuma!

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.230
Tori! Bronk!

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.690
Yuma, what's happening?

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.760
I'll tell you what's
happening.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.880
I'm about to beat
your Buddy!

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.860
Whoa, flip's
winning by a ton!

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.030
Yeah, and why are utopia and
leviathan on his field?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.630
Those are yuma's
monsters.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.130
They were his, till I
snatched them from him.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.230
it's my turn, but I only have
300 life points left.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.790
i've gotta protect them.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.760
Here goes... I draw!

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.260
aw, stinging swordsman?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.560
that's not the kinda
defense I was hoping for.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.330
[laughing]

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.360
by your expression I'd say you
didn't get the card you wanted.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.130
ugh, guess I don't have much of
a poker face.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.130
Yuma...

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.730
Well, don't blame
your duel deck too much.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.660
After all, I doubt you could do
much with any card at this

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.230
point. What, with the useless
xyz monster you have out on your

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.790
field, it's points are a
joke!

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.030
Points don't make
the monster.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.060
"Protect Tiragon..."

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.690
Wait, I wonder if astral
meant... of course.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.190
He wanted me to protect tiragon
for its ability,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.130
not it's defense points.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.760
A great ability is the flip side
of lots of weak monsters.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.030
And now, get ready tiragon!

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:05.060
I summon stinging swordsman!

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.160
Only 300 attack points?

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.360
That monster can't
possibly hurt me!

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.130
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.060
And would ya like
to know why, flip?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.590
Cause baby tiragon's
not so useless.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.330
And cause I'm feelin' the flow!
Baby tiragon,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.260
by using your overlay unit, my
level 1 monster

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.190
stinging swordsman
Can attack flip directly.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.490
So now, let's do it!

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.590
Take it to him!

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.230
Excuse me if I don't
go running for the hills,

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.530
but 300 points of damage isn't
exactly flinch worthy.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.790
Oh yeah?

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.160
Try this.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.830
I play stinging
Swordsman's ability!

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.190
Stinging SWORDSMAN:
Slash hurricane!

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.460
Slash hurricane?

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.130
You see flip, when stinging
Swordsman successfully

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.530
deals you damage,
then all spell and trap

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.090
cards on your field
return to your hand.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.560
All of them?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.990
Bingo!

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.290
And if the cards that snatched
utopia and leviathan Dragon

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.930
return to your hand, then
utopia and leviathan Dragon

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.330
return to me.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.430
No please, you can't
do this to me!

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.930
Yeah! Welcome home,
you two!

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.630
Astral, you okay?

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.930
Not yet.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.460
Huh?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.760
Go leviathan!

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.830
Attack that facedown
card!

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.930
No, it's my duel,
don't go!

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.330
Then again,
that's a pretty good call!

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.590
Leviathan, attack flip's
facedown card!

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.260
Go Sonic shredding
stream!

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:29.890
Alright!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.390
Flip doesn't have any monsters
left on the field now!

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.460
Utopia, go and
take him down!

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.960
Rising Sun slash!

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.060
[Screaming]
Mommy, ahh!

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.990
[Cheering]

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.330
Yeah!

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.060
That's how ya flow!

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.330
Yuma!

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.030
Way to go, Buddy!

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.830
Female VOICE: There are
two for one pretzels

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.330
in the food court today. Get
your coupons at the mall kiosk.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.930
Nicely done.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.860
You saved me from a
very bad fate.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.690
Aw, I didn't do it for you,
I just wanted to win.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.730
Yuma!

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.060
That was an amazing
comeback, bud.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.890
Yeah, I guess it
was pretty great.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.090
All my tricks...

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.430
and still I...
lost.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.560
Hey, flip?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.290
Huh?

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.690
I believe
this belongs to you.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.130
It did.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.590
It does. Take it.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.060
You earned it flip.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.190
Just like you earned my
respect the right way,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.830
by not cheating.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.560
That's gotta feel good
inside, doesn't it?

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.530
Yeah, I guess it
sorta does.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.930
Sorta?

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.490
Listen, all the respect you
think you got by cheating,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.360
wasn't real at all. You were
just tricking yourself.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.190
Maybe... or maybe
This is just a trick.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.790
And the flip side is you're
gonna make me look

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.730
like a big fool.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.930
Come on,
that's impossible.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.530
I mean, there's no way I could
make you look foolish.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.960
Not with those dope specs
you're always sporting.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.560
They're pretty hip!

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.060
You think my
glasses are... hip?

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.160
Yeah, totally.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:24.590
[crying]
yuma!

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.460
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me!

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.190
Forget the flip side,
life can be pretty great

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.430
when you just take
something at face value!

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.190
So I'm turning over
a new leaf right now.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.860
You keep the card, yuma!

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.130
Huh? Are you sure?

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.760
Yeah.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.460
[laughing]
thanks!

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.390
I did kinda form a
little bit of a bond with it!

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.730
And Hey, like you
said before flip,

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.130
this card can be a
symbol of our friendship!

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.490
Sounds Good!

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.160
[Laughing]

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.430
maybe there's no
flip side to this,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.930
but there is an
annoying side.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.290
Observation #9:
Glasses are hip.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.760
Okay, you guys can stop
laughing now. Really.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.730
My last domino.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.130
Wait...no...
no... noooo!

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.030
[Dominos clicking]

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.020
I am so gonna flip out!
