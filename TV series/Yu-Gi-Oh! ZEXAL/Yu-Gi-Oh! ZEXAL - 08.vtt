WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.530
Yuma: Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.030
SPARROW: It is nice to meet
you, my name is Nelson.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.330
Hey, what do you
say we get to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.360
know each other more
with a duel?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.260
Sparrow's mom:
There you are!

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.730
Who's this boy, Nelson?

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.290
Mom! Uhhh...

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.390
you're not to speak to anyone
except for authorized personnel!

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.560
If people found out what kind
of a kid you really are, the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.830
illusion of the Sparrow
would be shattered.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.590
It's a card...

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.890
NUMBER: Yes Nelson, let the
number take hold.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.390
Nelson has started thinking that
he's actually the Sparrow.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.690
Yuma, I didn't want it to come
to this, alas, if you're with

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.390
the dark emperor, then I have no
choice but to battle you!

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.860
Together: Let's duel!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.660
I xyz summon!

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.060
Kneel Before number 83 -
Galaxy queen!

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.560
I have journeyed through time
and space to fight the forces of

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.330
evil, and restore justice
to the galaxy!

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.230
Well you know what? I've
journeyed from my

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.860

You can't defeat the Sparrow!

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.490
Aw man, he really thinks
he's a superhero.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.290
'think about how many people
depend on

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.590
you being the Sparrow.'

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.030
'Nelson Andrews doesn't
matter...'

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.190
she's what this is all about.
The number card wouldn't be

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.460
messing with him like this
if it wasn't for his mom.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.030
I got it!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.290
[Phone ringing]

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.760
TORI: You have any idea
how late it is?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.490
Tori, you gotta listen
to me. It's important.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.830
I need you and bronk
to find Nelson's mom.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.230
Who's Nelson?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.030
Oh right, um Okay, look, I'm
dueling Nelson Andrews

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.960
aka, the Sparrow right now.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.060
You know that scary lady
who produces the show?

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490
That's his mom.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.060
I need you to find her and bring
her here to the sound stage.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.490
She needs to see this.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.030
Okay yuma.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.390
I'll find her!

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.390
I'll see you soon.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.590
Okay, I know that you're
still in there, Nelson.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.730
But don't worry,
I'm gonna do whatever

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.960
it takes to get you back!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.460
ASTRAL: Yuma, star Sparrow
can deal damage even

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.130
if your monster is in
defense mode this turn.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.460
If you want to survive that
attack, you need utopia.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.290
Do you think I don't
know that, astral?

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.890
Problem is, I've only got one
level 4 monster in my hand so

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.230
unless I manage to get another
one on my next draw, busting out

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.630
utopia's a no-go.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.960
No sense in waiting.
I draw!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.390
Alright!

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.760
I summon gagaga magician
to the field!

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.660
And that lets me summon
kagetokage as well.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.890
And now, since both of 'em are
level 4, I can d the overlay

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.330
network and Xyz
summon number 39!

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.660
Utopia!

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.390
I would advise you to use
this moment to defeat at

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.130
least one monster.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.030
Well Yeah, duhhh!

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.830
I wanna take out galaxy queen,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.530
but I can't cause of
furious Max's curse.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.890
Interesting...

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.460
what?
What's interesting?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.830
You are not arguing
with me tonight.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.090
Well, yeah!

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.960
Believe it or not, not
everything is about you!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.790
This duel is about
saving Nelson.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.160
I want to save him as well.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.830
You're acting different
too, ya' know.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.960
It's not like you to fixate so
much on someone else!

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.090
Nelson is lonely.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.290
Huh?

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.390
'Nelson Andrews
doesn't matter...'

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.030
I think I understand that
feeling and so I want to help.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.530
You're lonely?

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.330
It would seem that you
and I can work Well

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.290
together when our goals
are one and the same.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.390
Stop trying to get
"Buddy-Buddy" with me.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.930
Are we gonna do
This thing or not?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.230
Let us do it.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.590
Nice!

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.830
Alright big guy,
it's all you!

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.690
Attack Beast Warrior Puma!

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.330
Not good enough!

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.990
Cause I play the
wings of unity trap.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.130
And since I played it with esper
star Sparrow on my field,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.260
I can put a stop your attack!

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.430
And furthermore, it also lets me
summon Phoenix beast gairuda!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.990
If he keeps bringing monsters
out like this, we're done for.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.460
That gairuda looks like trouble!

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.260
Phoenix BEAST GAIRUDA: Did
someone say my name?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.060
Esper star SPARROW: Glad
you could swing by!

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.130
Beast WARRIOR PUMA: What took
you so long, gairuda?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.490
Luggwig captured the
sundarian Princess again.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.730
Is it just me, or are
these guys totally acting

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.260
like they do on the tv show?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.760
How wonderful to see it play out
before my very eyes!

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.330
You didn't abandon
the Princess, did you?

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.590
No!

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.690
I defeated the troll, saved the
girl, and now I'm here.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.160
I'm glad you are.
You too, Puma.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.590
Of course!

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.830
That's nice.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.460
Those guys seem to
really have a thing.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.530
I don't know why, but there is a
strange warmth filling my heart.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.560
We can't be admiring them!

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.530
We're supposed to be
worried and freaked out

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.490
that he's got four
monsters on his field!

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.960
Now, due to Phoenix beast
gairuda's ability,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.560
I'm able to draw one
card from my deck!

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.030
This is not good.
I have no idea what to do.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.690
You have to get
defensive!

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.030
Go with the card
on the right.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.390
You sure?

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.360
Positive.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.190
Well you better
be right, astral.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.360
I play one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.690
It's my turn!

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.330
I draw!

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.660
I'm summoning another
ally to join me!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.330
Aww, another one?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.630
When esper star Sparrow, beast
warrior Puma and Phoenix beast

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.860
gairuda are United on my field,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.530
I can summon their
friend from my hand.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.590
Forged in a factory on
the d-6 asteroid,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.260
the hero of keilos!

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Ironhammer the giant!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.530
[Roaring]

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.290
ironhammer , you made it!

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.360
Ironhammer was built by
Dr. Implausible.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.330
The doctor almost tossed him
into the lava pits of kelsedor,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.560
because he did not have enough
screws in his head.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.760
But the Sparrow swooped
in, and saved him.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.660
Ironhammer the GIANT: Duuuh,
what do ya' need me to do, boss?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.930
That looks like a toy robot I
used to play with, But real!

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.160
And really huge...

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.030
yuma!

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.690
Bronk: We got
the lady!

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.360
Quick warning,
she's not happy.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.230
What is going on?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.360
What is the meaning of...

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.590
Nelson? Is that you?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.160
What are you doing here?
It's past your bedtime.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.430
How did you get past
the guards?

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.460
Explain yourself, young man!
Right now!

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.260
Are you speaking to me?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.830
I hardly think that's
an appropriate

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.890
tone to take with your mother!

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.730
My mother?
I think you might be confused.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.660
My mother is right here.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.690
Nelson...

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.160
My name isn't Nelson.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.890
I am known as the one
and only Sparrow!

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.860
I'm not playing
around, Nelson.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.690
Hey, Nelson's mom!

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.360
You know how someone was
running around and

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.530
attacking people dressed
as the Sparrow?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.790
Yes...

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.330
It was him.
It was Nelson!

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.630
That is
preposterous!

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.190
It can't
be True!

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.390
You pressured him so much
to be the Sparrow,

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.860
that now he thinks he is.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.160
He doesn't know how to be
himself anymore.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.960
He's stuck in the
friction world!

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.390
"Friction?"

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.390
think he meant to say
"stuck in the fiction world."

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.860
Oooooh!

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.990
This can't be...
Nelson!

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.330
Number 83 GALAXY QUEEN: The
Sparrow lives only to serve me!

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
[laughing]

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.660
I do not cackle like that,
I...

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.330
you're in big trouble,
young man.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.560
When we get back to the...

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.160
...will you knock it off!

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.660
I think you should just watch
this duel, Nelson's mom.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.360
This duel will show
you how he sees you

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.130
and what you've done to him!

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.890
Let us continue!

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.990
I'm using an overlay
unit to once again

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.690
activate galaxy
queen's ability!

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.960
Just as before, the galaxy
queen grants all my monsters

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.560
immortality, and the ability to
deal damage even if your monster

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.960
is in defense mode this turn.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.860
Feel the power of darkness
flowing through you!

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.030
Embrace This power!

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.890
Defeat those who
would defy me!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.430
Yes, my queen!

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.290
I activate
gairuda's ability!

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.430
So now it gains
300 attack points.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.660
Go, gairuda!
Attack utopia!

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.830
Yuma!

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.230
I know, I'm on it!

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.130
I use one overlay unit to
activate utopia's ability!

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.860
And with that, gairuda's
attack is shut down!

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.260
Perhaps,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.730
but there's still plenty more
where that came from!

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.460
I am just getting started.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.760
Esper star Sparrow, take out
utopia with mega Punch surprise!

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.260
Bring it on!

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.460
Cause I can activate
utopia's ability again,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.130
and block your attack!

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.130
But now utopia has
no overlay units!

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.830
Meanwhile, I've still
got some tricks up my sleeve.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.530
Allow me to show you
what I mean by

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.660
activating ironhammer's
special ability!

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.960
Since ironhammer is on my field,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.460
one of my monsters can
attack directly!

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.990
Aw, no!

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.190
Go, Puma!
This is your moment!

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.260
Go dark slash!

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.190
[Screaming]

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.160
you okay?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.490
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.030
I'm not...

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.560
I'm fading away...

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.030
This is not good.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.490
Yuma quickly, activate
your trap card!

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.060
Are... are you sure?

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.030
You have to trust me.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.530
Alright.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.560
I activate my trap!

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.230
The trap is heartfelt appeal,
and we can activate it

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.030
because we took damage from
his direct attack.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.230
Great, but will the trap do?

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.730
It gives us control of his
monster with the highest defense

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.430
points until the end of
our next turn.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.090
Whoa...

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.330
that's better...

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.530
Ironhammer!...

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.690
what is this?

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.860
You're turning
against us?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.260
Duuuh, I can't help it, boss.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.230
I just suddenly have the urge to
protect this weakling behind me.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.990
You mean me, don't you?

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.430
You'll pay for this!

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.960
But for now, I'm ending my
turn with a facedown card.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.290
So umm... Why
did we snag ironhammer?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.490
I mean, if he's gonna go back to

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.290
Sparrow's side on his
next turn, then...

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.790
...it was the right move.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.630
Taking the giant was a necessary
step toward defeating them.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.330
If you say So, then you say so,
but look, if you've got a plan,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.660
then fill me in, okay?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.390
Or be like that.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.930
I know how things
will unfold.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.030
Huh? How do you know?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.330
Because I saw the
ending of the tv show.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.030
I can't believe you
based our strategy

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.390
on a science friction show.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.530
Forget it!

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.060
Moving on!

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.130
Aw man, I'm just not sure what
to do. But I can't give up.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.430
Okay, this ought to
buy me some time.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.260
I now activate the attraffic
control spell card!

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.030
So as long as you've got three
or more monsters on your field,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.360
this spell will prevent you
from being able to attack!

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.930
Yuma, that is it!

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.190
Hang on a sec!

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.330
You did it.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.090
The pieces are
all in place.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.590
We're going
to win this.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.790
Are you sure we're
dueling the same duel?

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.460
Cause in the duel I'm dueling,
the galaxy queen can't be

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.590
destroyed thanks to furious
Max's curse, and all the other

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.830
monsters can't be destroyed
thanks to the galaxy queen!

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.260
Everyone's invincible!

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.860
It is just like the show...

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.160
aw, here we go...

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.690
I saw this episode. Trust me.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.830
Sparrow gathered his allies
together, and transformed

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.090
ironhammer into the dimensional
iron jet, and together,

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.160
they defeated
the torian Prince.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.230
Just join the
fan club already!

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.690
Listen, play those
two cards in your hand.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.990
Huh?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.130
Play both of 'em?

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.530
I really hope I
don't regret this.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.090
I'm playing two cards facedown,
and ending my turn!

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.260
You're trying to stall.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.090
But this ends now!

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.690
I draw!

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.490
First, your trap card's
effect wears off.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.060
So ironhammer returns
to my field.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.730
Uhhh... what was I
doing just now?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.090
You must put a stop
to this threat!

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.360
Together: I will do as
you say, mother!

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.790
I don't like this!

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.590
Nelson, listen to me!

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.090
We're going back
to the hotel.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.860
We'll get some
ice-Cream.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.160
You don't have to be the Sparrow
right now,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.390
you can just be your...

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.630
...that's enough!

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.160
I have to be the Sparrow!

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.090
Do you have any idea how many
people are depending on me?

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.160
Nelson...

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.230
you think you managed to cage me
in with attraffic control.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.560
But I'm activating the change
to jet iron Trap card!

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.230
When Sparrow and his allies are
all gathered on the field

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.030
together, they can unite to form
the dimensional iron jet!

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.460
Whoa...

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.060
With twin titanium engines and
dual sonic thrusters,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.890
dimensional iron Jet packs
enough attack power to defeat

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.830
you, and win this duel!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.430
Oh man, that thing has
enough attack power

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.590
to end this duel
right now!

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.990
Deep breath...

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.760
Just play a trap card.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.030
Oh, a trap card?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.790
Play a trap card?

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.560
Which one should
I activate?

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.960
Oh, wait!

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.860
I need some
Duel fuel!

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.230
There we go!

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.090
He must really
be unsure.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.890
I am totally
feelin' the flow!

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.290
Now about that trap card...

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.660
I give you fiery fervor!

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.490
Alright, that trap doubled
utopia's attack points!

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.530
Maybe so, But iron
jet is still more powerful.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.490
Aaaah! Can I take
that move back?

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.990
Not a chance, yuma!

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.590
And as much as I'd hate to kick
you when you're down, I'd like

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.290
to point out that my four
monsters have become one.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.090
Which means your
attraffic control spell

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.060
is no longer effective!

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.560
Aaaahh!

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.060
Activate a trap!

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.730
Guess we've got nothing
better to do!

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.790
I'm activating the
reserve cyclone trap!

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.890
This trap card activates
because he took

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.330
ironhammer the giant
back from you.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.160
And that is precisely
why I had wanted you

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.860
to take control of
it in the first place.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.560
Aw sweet, that means we can get
rid of furious Max's curse!

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.960
Say goodbye to your
Trump card, chump!

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.390
What's this?

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.930
No!

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.630
Now, there are no cards
protecting the galaxy queen.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.960
You may have broken
Max's curse,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.430
but now I'm going
to break you!

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.560
Jet Iron, attack
number 39: Utopia!

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.030
Go Iron Phoenix!

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.430
Aaargh!

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.160
Here Comes defeat from above!

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.860
It is going to be fine.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.030
Remember, there is still one
trap card on our field.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.630
Oh, right!

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.790
'the pieces are
almost in place!'

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.460
oh wow, you did know it
would go down like this.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.790
Well then, I activate
my trap card!

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.530
Vector change!

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.730
This trap lets me force your jet
iron into defense mode.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.360
This is not good...

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.860
and it forces your
monster playing defense

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.090
to get its attack mode on!

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.860
Impossible!
Now I can't attack!

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.390
Mother...

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.960
I have...
let you down...

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.130
no, this isn't
over yet!

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.430
You're going
to lose, yuma.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.660
I end my turn.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.160
I draw!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.360
Nice!

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.190
All he has to do is
attack galaxy queen.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.560
You've got this, yuma!

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.960
Actually, there is
still a risk factor.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.660
If that facedown card is a trap
card that counter attacks,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.190
he might win.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.330
And I might...

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.990
but... This is our only
chance to save Nelson...

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.090
I know.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.560
So... are you with me?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.230
Let us do it.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.960
So get ready Sparrow!

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.190
E I am so feeling
the flow!

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.230
Utopia, attack galaxy queen!

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.590
Go Rising sun slash!

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.130
Not so fast, yuma.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.330
I activate the trap card
star Sparrow forever!

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.460
What is it?

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.760
Is it a counter card?

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.890
This card allows me
to bring star Sparrow out

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.790
of my graveyard with
zero attack points!

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.090
And like he always does,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.790
Sparrow jumps in to protect
those being attacked!

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.660
[Screaming]

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.230
Nelson, no!

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.530
You did it yuma!

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.930
Yeah, you did it!

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.730
It wasn't a trap
that could hurt me...

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.530
so what was the point?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.290
Bringing star Sparrow
to the field with

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.860
no attack points had no
strategic merit.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.490
Why would he do something
that was pointless?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.830
It wasn't pointless.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.230
He wanted to protect her.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.030
He was protecting his mom.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.630
This memory is...

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.360
there she goes.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:07.590
Nelson...

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.990
mom?

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.790
I don't know what
happened to me.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.190
Don't worry, it...
it... it's over now.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.860
Nelson, I'm sorry I've been
pushing you so hard.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.190
It's okay.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.260
I want you to be you.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.190
I really do.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.560
Thanks, mom.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.790
Mom!

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:39.590
[laughing]

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.260
I'm getting all
teary-Eyed!

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.130
Maybe now he won't
feel so lonely.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.890
So, I'm hungry.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.930
Who's up for a little spicy
Pizza cheeseburger action?

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.760
If you knew the truth
about those attacks,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.660
why didn't you tell me while we
were out running around?

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.390
I figured if you found out
that the Sparrow was

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.390
behind all those attacks, you
would've gotten all sad.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.630
Uh...

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.930
aww!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.030
You care about my feelings,
don't you?

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.730
No, that's gross, I don't care!

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.590
You're just annoying when
you're sad, that's all!

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.860
I'm annoying?

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.690
You should try talking to
you one day, yuma!

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.090
Besides, when have you
ever seen me sad?

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.390
Are you serious?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.790
How about the time you
gave Ashton Williams

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.360
that Valentine card, and and he
said 'No thanks?'

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.730
unnnh!

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.790
Let's just go!

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.190
How are you able to
resist my scepter's power?

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.460
[Screaming]

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.260
Sparrow...

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.190
you did it.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.260
Mother...

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.830
[crying]

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.630
what a wonderful story!

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.960
Right?

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.090
Observation number 10 - The
bond between a human parent

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.930
and a human child is strong.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.660
Very strong.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.990
That memory...

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.060
I was remembering the
moment I was born.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.360
Female voice:
Your name... is astral.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.730
And you are being entrusted
with the future of our world.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:46.030
[♪...]
