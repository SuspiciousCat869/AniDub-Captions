WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.835
(Yuma)
Last time
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal..."

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:07.379
(Dr. Faker)
Fix your fearful eyes on
Heart-Earth's true form!

00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:11.450
Number 92,
Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.426
Neo Galaxy-Eyes,

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:16.387
attack with Ultimate Photon
Stream of Destruction!

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.169
Set Hart free now.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.804
Release him!

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:28.805
I can't!

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:29.939
You think you're helping Hart,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.207
but you're only putting him
in greater danger!

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.810
Your younger brother
cannot hope to survive

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.745
unless Astral World is destroyed
once and for all!

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.482
In my quest to save the boy,

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.186
I decided I had to look
outside our world

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.054
for a solution.

00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:46.189
I abandoned everything else.

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:48.191
Even my own principles.

00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.760
I soon discovered Barian.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.795
It was a strange world with
energy resources

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.531
that seemed to be unique.

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.166
I did not hesitate to make
a deal with them.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.435
They promised me that they
would save Hart...

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:01.204
and in exchange,

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:02.772
I agreed to destroy
Astral World.

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:05.208
(Barian)
Dr. Faker!

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.709
You almost succeeded.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:08.544
But at the critical moment,
you faltered!

00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:11.547
Stay away!

00:01:11.547 --> 00:01:13.516
I will have to complete
what you began.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:16.185
You three believe you
can defeat me?

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:19.188
Then I will give
you the chance to prove it!

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:22.125
This duel is far from over!

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.961
What do you mean...
Who are you?

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.863
I am from Barian World!

You're from Barian?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.102
And you're out to
destroy Astral World?

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.471
That is correct.

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:42.672
And I will not let
anything or anyone interfere

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:45.641
with the completion of
my mission!

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:48.211
He took over Dr. Faker so he
can finish the duel!

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.184
Barian!

00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:57.086
Now to complete my takeover

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:58.721
so I can finish you off.

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:00.556
Much better!

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.527
Now I have an
unpleasant surprise for you.

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:07.497
Heart-Earth Dragon has
another ability

00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:09.866
you were clueless about.

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:11.467
If it has no Overlay Units
when it is destroyed,

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.203
it can come back one last time!

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.106
Heart-Earth's attack points
are equal

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:18.574
to the number
of banished cards,

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.209
multiplied by one thousand!

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.211
Looks like we've
gone back to square one.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:26.182
Your situation has become
even more desperate

00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:28.784
than you realize.

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:30.853
Your Neo Galaxy-Eyes is
now switched to defense mode.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.193
Oh, great!

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:38.194
What are we gonna do now?

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.929
Kite!

00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:42.465
His misery will soon end!

00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:45.101
In fact, none of you will
survive this turn!

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:48.204
I draw!

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:49.705
Your downfall is assured
as I activate

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:51.574
the spell Barian's Gateway!

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:53.843
Every time your monster is
sent to the graveyard,

00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:56.179
it bombards you
with 800 points of damage!

00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:59.182
Uh-oh!

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:00.183
Think quick!

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:03.586
We only have a hundred life
points left, guys! Too late!

00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:07.190
Heart-Earth Dragon will strike
your monster downending this duel
and your last chance

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.791
to oppose my plans!

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.093
Attack Neo Galaxy-Eyes!

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:13.129
Dragon Cannon Blast!

00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:18.201
I activate
the trap Photon Escape!

00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:21.204
This card banishes
Neo Galaxy-Eyes

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:23.472
and ends the battle.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.941
So your attack fails!

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.776
You have only delayed
your unavoidable defeat.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.713
It is true you will
take no damage,

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:33.182
but since you banished a card,

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:35.017
my Heart-Earth will
now grow

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.652
one thousand
attack points stronger!

00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:38.788
It'll be even
harder to destroy it now

00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:41.190
I can't give up.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.161
But you're not well.

00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:46.596
I don't care!

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:47.730
If you wanna take my
little brother,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.198
you've gotta get past me first!

00:04:49.198 --> 00:04:51.634
And I'm never gonna let
that happen!

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:54.503
Hart!

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:57.206
That was Kite.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:59.475
I'm activating Dimension
Wanderer's special ability!

00:05:01.978 --> 00:05:05.147
By sending Dimension Wanderer
to the graveyard,

00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:07.483
I can combine the attack points

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:09.652
of two banishes monsters and
then deal the point total

00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:12.188
to you as damage!

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:14.090
I choose Shark Drake Veiss
and Neo Galaxy-Eyes.

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:18.494
That's 7,300 points of damage!

00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:21.130
And that means this
duel's over!

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.199
Ready?

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.500
You bet!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.801
You first,
Neo Galaxy-Eyes!

00:05:27.203 --> 00:05:29.639
Go Ultimate Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:33.109
Now you, Shark Drake Veiss!

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:37.613
Chaos Stream!

00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:53.029
I admire your
effort, but it means nothing,

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.098
because my Barian's Gateway
spell has another effect!

00:05:56.098 --> 00:06:00.102
All I have to do is
send this card to the graveyard

00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:03.205
and I take no damage!

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:10.446
He dodged yet another
attack of ours!

00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:13.082
Oh no, Kite, are you okay?

00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:17.853
Not you, too!

00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:21.190
Now that I have
worn down two of you,

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.494
I can end my turn.

00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:27.196
Only you stand in my way
now, Yuma Tsukumo,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.700
but not for much longer!

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:40.676
Your life points are almost
gone, Yuma Tsukumo.

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:43.412
With your friends
down and your field empty,

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:45.948
you stand alone.

00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.017
Which means
that you are destined

00:06:48.017 --> 00:06:49.418
for complete destruction

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.187
just like Astral World!

00:06:51.187 --> 00:06:53.756
No!

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:54.657
We've come too far!

00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:56.625
Yuma and Kite are trying their
best to save me.

00:06:57.193 --> 00:07:00.963
But now&amp;
I must try to save them!

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:11.107
No Hart, what are you doing!?

00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:14.210
Brother.

00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:23.786
That power!

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:25.421
No, Hart...
All that energy...

00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:28.624
It belongs to Barian World!

00:07:28.624 --> 00:07:31.060
It is the power I infused
in you!

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.697
The field!

00:07:34.697 --> 00:07:35.731
It is destabilizing!

00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:38.534
Now's your chance, Yuma.

00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:40.202
You and Astral can end this!

00:07:40.202 --> 00:07:42.605
Your combined
powers will be too much

00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:44.206
for that thing to handle!

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:46.208
(Astral) Yuma...

00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:47.810
It is true!

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.145
We must join together!

00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:53.115
Let's do this!

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.189
Here goes!

00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:06.562
Yuma!

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.100
I'm feelin' the flow!

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:13.836
All set?

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:17.940
You betcha!

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.475
All right, it is time
for you and I

00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:20.810
to build the Overlay Network!

00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.617
Get ready, Astral!

00:08:29.084 --> 00:08:30.586
When two distant souls
become one,

00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:35.424
the power of Zexal is revealed!

00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:39.061
Zexal Morph!

00:08:50.473 --> 00:08:54.477
This must be the power I have
heard so much about.

00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:57.580
That's right!

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.181
And I'll defend Astral World no
matter what it takes!

00:08:59.181 --> 00:09:02.051
You can't win, Barian!

00:09:02.051 --> 00:09:03.919
The bond that the two of
us share is simply too strong

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:06.722
for you to ever break!

00:09:06.722 --> 00:09:08.090
It's my turn!

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.159
(Astral)
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:13.929
He can even
generate the very card

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:15.898
that he needs to draw!

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:18.200
Let's do this!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.203
Go Shining Draw!

00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:23.472
I summon
Zexal Weapon Ultimate Shield!

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:36.552
Next, I activate its special
ability!

00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:39.188
Once I summon this card,

00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.056
I can bring back up to three
Xyz monsters

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:43.192
that had
been previously banished,

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:45.094
as long as I negate their
special abilities.

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:47.563
Three monsters!

00:09:47.563 --> 00:09:49.031
Return, Chaos Number 39,
Utopia Ray!

00:09:56.205 --> 00:09:59.608
Yuma, it's time.

00:09:59.608 --> 00:10:01.710
We can all combine our
powers now.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.146
I call on you, Chaos Number 32,

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:07.716
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:13.422
Return to battle, Neo
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:21.063
Three banished monsters are now
back on my field,

00:10:21.063 --> 00:10:23.666
which means your Heart-Earth
Dragon is forced to give up

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:25.935
3000 attack points!

00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:28.170
You see?

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:31.674
Standing together, we're too
powerful for you!

00:10:31.674 --> 00:10:34.610
Or so you believe!

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.612
But you are still destined
for destruction!

00:10:36.612 --> 00:10:39.048
Just look!

00:10:39.048 --> 00:10:40.182
Now what?

00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.818
Oh no, the Sphere Field Cannon!

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:45.187
Even without Astral,

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.855
the cannon now has more
than enough energy

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.791
to obliterate Astral World!

00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:51.560
Nothing you do can stop
me from completing my plan!

00:11:04.044 --> 00:11:05.207
In a moment, Astral World will
be wiped out of existence

00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:08.811
and all of you along with it!

00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:10.846
No!

00:11:11.814 --> 00:11:14.116
I'll hold you off by equipping
Ultimate Shieldonto Utopia Ray!

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:16.118
That will give Utopia Ray 2000
more defense points!

00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:26.095
On top of that,
I equip the spell Xyz Unity

00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:29.098
on Utopia Ray!

00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:31.066
This switches Utopia Ray into
attack mode!

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:36.939
But that is not all!

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:41.043
Utopia Ray gains the attack
points of all Xyz monsters on our
field in defense mode!

00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:43.178
Therefore, Utopia Ray has 9,800
attack points!

00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:47.082
Impossible!

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.183
Now...

00:11:48.183 --> 00:11:50.486
Get 'em, Utopia Ray!

00:11:50.486 --> 00:11:52.187
Fool!

00:11:53.188 --> 00:11:56.191
Raising your monster's attack
points was a mistake, because
Heart-Earth Dragon

00:11:56.191 --> 00:11:57.593
bounces the damage back to you!

00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:01.030
And that's why I'm activating
Xyz Unity's other effect

00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:07.636
by sending Shark Drake
Veiss to the graveyard.

00:12:07.636 --> 00:12:10.205
Utopia Ray can attack again

00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:12.207
only now it can attack
you directly!

00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:15.210
Unless I put a stop to it,
that is!

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:18.113
I activate the trap
Barian's Battle Buster!

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.417
Now by banishing a Barian card
in my graveyard,

00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:24.720
I can stop two monster
attacks during this turn!

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.923
I banish Barian's Gateway,

00:12:27.923 --> 00:12:30.192
thus stopping your pathetic
direct attack!

00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:39.201
No sweat!

00:12:39.201 --> 00:12:40.669
I'll just
send Neo Galaxy-Eyes

00:12:40.669 --> 00:12:42.204
to the graveyard so that I can
attack you

00:12:42.438 --> 00:12:44.206
one more time!

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:45.941
And once again, I attack you
directly!

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:49.845
Worthless move!

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:51.113
All I have to do is activate
Barian Battle Buster's effect!

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:55.184
Then your direct attack is
stopped again!

00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:58.487
Plus, when
I send Barian's Battle Buster

00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:01.190
to the graveyard,

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.625
I can force one monster on
the field to engage in battle!

00:13:03.692 --> 00:13:07.029
We're cooked!

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:08.030
If he picks Utopia Ray...

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.531
then 6,800 points of damage

00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.200
will come bouncing back at us!

00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:22.945
Victory!

00:13:22.945 --> 00:13:24.580
It is doomsday for
you and Astral World!

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.584
You just lost.

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:30.185
What?

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.420
I activate Ultimate Shield's
special ability!

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.823
Ultimate Shield
not only stops that damage,

00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:36.959
but that amount is added to
Utopia Ray's attack points!

00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:40.929
But there's more,

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:42.931
Heart-Earth Dragon's special
abilities are negated!

00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:49.104
Oh, no!

00:13:49.104 --> 00:13:50.205
No way!

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.607
It cannot be!

00:13:53.142 --> 00:13:56.545
This battle is over!

00:13:56.979 --> 00:14:00.182
Get set, Utopia Ray!

00:14:00.415 --> 00:14:02.184
Attack with Rising Sun
Ultimate Slash!

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:24.139
You will pay for this!

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.842
I warned you!

00:14:28.777 --> 00:14:30.078
Our bond is way too strong
for you!

00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:40.489
No!

00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:41.190
Hart!

00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:42.157
Hart!

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.598
I gotcha!

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.503
Kite, I'm free!

00:14:54.503 --> 00:14:56.205
Yes, you're free Hart.

00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:58.707
It's all over.

00:14:58.707 --> 00:15:00.676
You're gonna be safe now.

00:15:06.915 --> 00:15:10.118
Tori!

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.119
Are you okay!?

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.455
Orbital!

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.456
I command you to wake up!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.191
That's an order!

00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:18.193
Sir...
I'm wide-awake!

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:20.729
Where am I?

00:15:23.198 --> 00:15:26.134
It's Kite...

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.636
and Hart!

00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.205
Father!

00:15:30.205 --> 00:15:31.974
No... Father!

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:38.146
Orbital, take care of Hart.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.182
You're leaving?

00:15:40.182 --> 00:15:41.183
But, Master!

00:15:41.183 --> 00:15:42.184
I have to go!

00:15:42.184 --> 00:15:44.186
Brother!

00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:46.889
Kite, come back!

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:49.524
I will Hart.

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:50.826
After I save our father!

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.895
Tori, look after Shark.

00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:56.064
Good luck.

00:15:56.064 --> 00:15:58.567
Thanks Shark.

00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:00.502
Hang on, Kite!

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.570
I'm on my way!

00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:12.748
Now where's my Dad?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.555
Dad!

00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:26.762
I got you!

00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:29.831
You came for me?

00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:31.833
Let's go.

00:16:37.105 --> 00:16:40.208
Yuma!

00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:44.713
Why are you helping me, Yuma?

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.182
I once betrayed your father.

00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:50.185
I despise what you did,

00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:52.120
but I also understand
that you thought

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.522
you were helping your
son, Hart.

00:16:53.522 --> 00:16:56.191
If my dad were here, I'm sure
he'd help you, as well.

00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:07.169
You are just like your father.

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:10.205
But I don't deserve any mercy.

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:12.774
My actions were
truly unforgiveable.

00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:15.911
No!

00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:17.179
If you're sorry...
(Vetrix)
Faker!

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:19.548
Those you wronged will
be revenged.

00:17:20.682 --> 00:17:23.885
Vetrix!

00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:25.420
Hang on tight, folks!

00:17:26.888 --> 00:17:28.190
This could be a really
rough ride!

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.892
Yuma!

00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:33.195
Yuma!

00:17:35.197 --> 00:17:38.500
Vetrix...

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.102
Don't do it.

00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:41.603
Hasn't there
been enough suffering?

00:17:43.171 --> 00:17:46.508
Please, Byron,

00:17:46.508 --> 00:17:50.012
I deserve whatever vengeance

00:17:50.012 --> 00:17:51.446
you want to carry out,

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:52.848
but Kite and Yuma are innocent.

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:54.583
Let them go!

00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:55.851
Then you can settle
things with me.

00:17:55.851 --> 00:17:57.786
Father!

00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:02.891
Let go of your rage!

00:18:04.926 --> 00:18:08.096
I will now show you...

00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:10.832
my great power!

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:27.182
Don't worry, you guys.

00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:29.584
I'm sure Yuma and Kite
will be okay.

00:18:29.584 --> 00:18:33.121
They'll find a way out somehow.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:47.135
Wait, what happened?

00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:49.571
Hey, we made it!

00:18:51.873 --> 00:18:54.009
Yuma, you made it out?

00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:59.181
Kite!

00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:00.182
Father!

00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:01.516
Okay, you can stop crying
now, Tori.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.119
I'm totally fine.

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.887
Ha!

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:06.922
You don't understand a thing!

00:19:06.922 --> 00:19:08.423
I wasn't crying because
I was worried,

00:19:08.423 --> 00:19:10.926
but because you came back

00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:12.427
to complicate my life
even more!

00:19:13.995 --> 00:19:15.197
Byron.

00:19:21.103 --> 00:19:24.206
Byron.

00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:26.975
Yes, Faker.

00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:29.978
Byron, I'm so sorry.

00:19:31.012 --> 00:19:34.416
Goodbye, my friend.

00:19:37.018 --> 00:19:40.689
May you and your sons
find peace!

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.625
After all that I did,
he forgave me.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:53.135
How's he doin' there, Dextra?

00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:55.170
He should pull through
just fine.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.105
Let's head for the med
center, Nistro.

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.074
Will do!

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.208
Bye, Shark.

00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.577
I know you're in good hands.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.446
(Dr. Faker)
Forgive me, Hart.

00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:06.748
I have much to make up for...

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.184
to you and your brother.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.987
I hope that in time,
we can be a true family again.

00:20:13.722 --> 00:20:17.025
It is over.

00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:18.560
Well done, Yuma.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.795
Wait, it's not over yet!

00:20:20.795 --> 00:20:23.198
I still get to have one
wish granted

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.000
for winning the Duel Carnival!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.068
And for my wish I
wanna have a duel against Kite!

00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:30.205
C'mon, What do you say?

00:20:30.205 --> 00:20:32.741
That sounds intriguing

00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:35.210
This would be the Carnival's
real final, Kite.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.547
Well, then.

00:20:38.547 --> 00:20:39.447
In that case, I say...

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.183
when do we start?

00:20:41.183 --> 00:20:43.185
The sooner the better!

00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:45.921
And may the best duelist win!
