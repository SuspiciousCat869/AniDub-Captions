00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.190
Yuma: Last time,
on yu-Gi-Oh zexal...

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.060
CRASHBUG: Crashbug!

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.490
Mr. Kay: Time to go viral.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.990
Buggy buggy buggy!

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.130
You guys know the legend behind

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.690
crashbug, right?

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.030
Crashbug's this little

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.490
electrical spirit... and he

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730
likes to zap what he calls bugs.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.290
Bugs are those feelings that get

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.630
in our way.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.230
Caswell: Crashbug
doesn't actually exist.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.490
Of course it
exists I've seen it.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.260
-Tori: Look. Isn't that...?
-YUMA: Caswell...

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930
Yeah, and he's acting
suspicious.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.830
Hey, what are you doing?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.730
[Gasps]

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.190
caught red-handed!

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
I'm not behind this,
I'm being used.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.590
If I can pinpoint the location
this machine was just accessed

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.830
from, then we'll know where the
criminal is and... Wait...

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.560
there's our location!

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.590
Mr. Kay: You finally put
the pieces together.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.790
Mr. Kay is the
criminal mastermind

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.190
behind the malicious virus!

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130
[Laughing]

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.190
a number.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.590
[together]: Let's duel!

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.930
Prepare to meet your defeat.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.660
Here comes number 34!

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.560
Terror-Byte!

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.130
Kari: I've broken through the
viral program's firewall.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.690
Now where's the
deactivation code?

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.060
In the end, you're going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.890
lose this duel, and I'm going to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.530
infect the entire city's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.030
control system.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.090
And that's been the case
since the very beginning!

Mr. Kay: Your defeat is coming
yuma, I can assure you.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.190
But for now, I place one card

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.430
facedown and end my turn.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.190
Uhh okay, um lemme think,
lemme think...

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.960
COMPUTER: Attention. Viral
release will occur in

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.730
exactly 20 minutes.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.260
Astral: It is my turn.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.490
I can do this
by myself, astral!

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.660
Yuma keeps yelling and
screaming at someone

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.090
who clearly isn't there.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.690
In the end, should we be
concerned about him?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.360
No no, he's fine.
Don't worry, Caswell.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.530
This is just what yuma's like

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.160
when he's really
feelin' the flow.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.130
It's my turn. I draw!

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.690
I suggest that you summon
ganbara Knight.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.230
Go away, and
duel your own duel!

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.460
A number card is on the
line here, yuma.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.030
If we don't get that
number, I may fade away.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.590
Oh, yeah? Well maybe I
should let him win then.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.790
You need me, yuma.
You cannot duel without me.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.460
You are not good enough.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.890
Stop talking to me,
and just go away!

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.730
I'm not gonna do anything you
tell me to do in this duel.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.490
Why would you disregard
my valuable advice?

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.560
If you tell me that I should
go to the right, then I'm gonna

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960
break to the left.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.630
You say I should bust out
ganbara Knight?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.690
So I'll summon achacha Archer!

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.760
Bad move.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.130
Fire away!

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.930
Aaahhh!

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.530
Woohooo!
See what I did?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.330
I managed to damage
his life points.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.390
Perhaps, but you missed out.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.730
Huh?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.090
If you had summoned ganbara
Knight as I advised you to,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.160
you would have been able to
combine it with your golem,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.660
and then xyz, summon utopia.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.860
Oh, I hadn't thought
about that.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.490
Unnhh, I mean it's all
part of my master plan.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.690
You're messing
with my perfection.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.630
But fortunately,
I've got a trap.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.290
Damage vaccine Omega Max!

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.130
And since I just took damage, I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.760
can use this card to regain all

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.460
the life points I just lost.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.130
Are you telling me
my attack was pointless?

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.690
In a way, this entire duel is

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.260
pointless, my dear boy.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.760
Someone like you can't defeat

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.860
someone like me.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.590
Aaah, I can see my future now!

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.230
They're gonna think I was part
of this and they're gonna throw

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.730
me in jail for life!

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.160
I'm never gonna be valedictorian

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.760
and I'll never get a job and

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.230
yuma's running out of time and

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.360
that means...

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm running out of time!

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.560
The deactivation code Should
be somewhere in the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.260
vpn tunnels ahead.
I'm on to you, virus!

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.360
Ehh... I end my turn.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.760
You accomplished nothing!

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.630
Just as I did on my last turn,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.130
I can use my number Card's

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.760
overlay unit to seize control of

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.130
your monster!

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.430
Wait Wait, what?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.060
no, no, hang on, don't, wait,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.230
no, that's...

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.090
aaaahhh!

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.160
Arrrrh!

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.230
He got my gogogo Golem again!

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.160
If you had summoned utopia,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.190
then he would not have been able
to take control of your golem.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.130
-Really?
-Terror-Byte's ability allows

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.130
it to take control of a monster

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.490
with a certain level.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.430
But xyz monsters like utopia

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.390
have ranks, not levels.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.590
Understand?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.430
You are clearly inexperienced.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.890
You should listen to me.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.560
Forget that.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.960
So I take a little damage.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.160
Big deal.
Gogogo golem's gonna

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.530
return to my field.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.590
And when that happens...

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.090
-[laughing]
-Huh?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.630
Do you seriously expect me to

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.560
use the same exact Strategy two

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.430
turns in a row?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.930
This time around, I'm activating

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.630
-Two continuous spells!
-[crying]

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.590
do you know what a
continuous spell is?

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.460
It's just like a normal spell,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.360
only its effect stays active for

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.060
as long as the card remains on
the field.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.260
Now please Let me go back to
freaking out.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.460
With infected mail
once a turn, any level-4

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.630
or below monster on my field
can attack you directly.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.930
But after it attacks,
it's destroyed.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.990
Oh no...

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.690
and since it's on my field,
I'm going to attack you with

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.590
your very own gogogo golem!

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.630
Aaahhh!

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.660
So sorry yuma, but now it's

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.130
time to say goodbye to your

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.260
precious golem.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.530
Oh man, this is not good!

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.060
I'm afraid it gets worse!

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.060
for it's at this moment that my
second Continuous spell

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.660
activates.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.360
Since infected mail destroyed
your golem, cracking slams you

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.760
with an additional 800
points of damage!

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.260
[laughing]

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So what do ya' think of my
special patented terror-Byte

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.690
combo?

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.060
Uh well, I think your special
patented terro-Byte combo...

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.590
stinks.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.160
Huh?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.460
That's weird.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.830
Uh... why are you more
see-Through than before?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.630
Every time you lose life

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.530
points, I can feel my life force

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.190
fading.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.690
Fading... like...
that must mean...

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.330
you weren't kidding.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.130
"Failure is not an
option for me."

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.860
Yuma seems like he's lost
some of his enthusiasm.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.860
Of course he's
lost his enthusiasm.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.490
He's losing this duel.
He's gonna totally get me...

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.460
...uhh... I know...
Hey, yuma!

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.690
Huh?

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.630
Be like the, the Phoenix!
And rise from the ashes...

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.430
Why are you?
What are you?

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.460
Nah, forget the Phoenix.
Yeah, there's a Dragon in your

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.830
heart, yuma.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.990
A... a... a... giant sleeping
DRAGON bird monster.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.460
In the end, what I'm saying is

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.930
that you've got tremendous

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.230
potential inside of you.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.590
Uh I do?

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.430
All you have to do is wake
that potential up and this duel

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.930
is yours!

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.490
Uhh... Thanks, uhh...

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.730
that's a really cool
thing for you to say.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.930
Let's go.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.430
Let's wake up the Dragon.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.530
Observation number 6:

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.360
Praise motivates humans.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.960
Yuma, I also have something I

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.760
have been meaning
to say to you.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.430
What, astral?

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.690
You are illogical, and
you anger too easily.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.230
You are clumsy and Lacking
athletic ability.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.860
You are stubborn
too. And odd.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.430
But these are all
excellent traits.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.990
So earlier, when I said
you were inexperienced,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.890
I meant to say - Incredible.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.760
Yeah, right.
Now you're just making

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.190
fun of me!

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.090
What's that?
What's going on?

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.230
Why is the room moving?

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.860
Oh whoa...
the ceiling's opening.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.560
We're we're going up, we're...

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.490
we're outside!

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.960
Are we going all
the way to the top?

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.630
Bingo!

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.490
The viral code Should be just
beyond that door.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.930
Crash...

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.160
buuuggg!

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.190
You want a piece of me,
do ya'? bring it on.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.830
You're about to learn a valuable
lesson. Never underestimate a

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.760
black belt in codebreaking!

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.630
Aaahhhh!

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.290
From up here,
we'll have the best view in the

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.390
city to witness the results of
the viral bug.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.690
I'm placing one card facedown,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.560
and ending my turn.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.190
if yuma loses this duel,

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.430
I will fade away...

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.230
how can I get him
to listen to me?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.890
"I'm not gonna do anything you
tell me to do in This duel!

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.360
If you tell me that I should go
to the right, then I'm gonna

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.790
break to the left!"

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.890
that gives me an idea...

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.360
here I go.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.760
It's my turn!

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.160
I draw!

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.590
Ha, sweet!

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.490
I drew a great card.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.890
Goblindbergh,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.860
take to the skies!

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.260
This is what I call a very
promising development.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.390
Because when goblindbergh comes

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.790
to the field, it can bring

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.830
another monster with it!

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.030
Yuma, use this opportunity to
summon zubaba Knight.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.960
Thanks for the suggestion,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.790
since you think I should
go with zubaba Knight,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.290
I think I'll go with
ganbara Knight.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.460
Whoa, I just realized...
they're both level 4.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.030
That means
I can xyz summon utopia!

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.460
I am feeling the flow like you

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.230
would not believe.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.760
I'm high-Fiving the sky, baby!

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.260
I'm not just in the zone,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.490
there's like another zone inside

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.930
the zone, and that's the zone

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.260
I'm in!

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.790
Now check me out as I xyz
summon...

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.330
number 39, utopia!

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.430
Whoa, utopia.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.490
Yuma, listen.
Do not lay down a trap card.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.660
You're not skilled
enough to use one.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.460
Not skilled enough?
I'm all about skill,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.930
you floating bag of wind,
I'll show you.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.890
I'm placing one card facedown.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.360
It's all you, teach.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.130
[boxing]

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.460
delete my entire hard drive
and erase my scoop, did ya?

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.390
I did it.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.530
Bug... bug, bug!

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.590
It's my turn now!

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.790
And once again, I activate

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.490
terror-Byte's special ability.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.790
This time, I'll be taking

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.290
control of achacha Archer.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.990
Use your own
monsters for once.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.630
Why should I?
Thanks to my terror-Byte combo,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.590
I get so much more out of
turning your monsters

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.930
against you.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.430
Because of Mr. Kay's combo,

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.360
Archer will go down, and then
take yuma down with him.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.560
Aaah! You mean if this
succeeds, my goose is cooked?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.730
Too bad utopia is so useless.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.330
If only it had some ability...

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.190
Wait a second!
Utopia has the perfect ability.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.660
I got an overlay unit for ya',
Mr. Kay.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.190
Go ahead and hit me with your
best shot,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.930
cause thanks to utopia,
I can put a stop to one

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.130
monster's attack.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.590
Infected mail's effect only

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.190
activates when the monster's

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.890
direct attack succeeds.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.330
Since utopia has stopped the

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.130
attack, not only is Archer safe,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.990
But cracking will not be able

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.030
to activate either.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.090
Ha, yeah. I can stop you from
pulling off your combo.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.330
Well it seems I may have
underestimated you.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.060
Yuma's been displaying some
rare bursts of intelligence.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.460
It's probably the invisible

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.230
duelist telling him what to do.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.030
You were serious about that?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.460
Now your teacher has used up

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.090
all of his overlay units.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.360
Nice.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.060
You can't do your combo anymore.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.490
You don't honestly think that

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.990
I failed to gauge your strategy
just now, do you, yuma?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.730
Maybe.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.060
You've managed to pave a new
road leading straight towards

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.490
my victory.
I now activate,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.990
the bug switch Trap card!

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.790
When crashbug x, y and z are

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.060
in my graveyard, I switch one of

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.030
my monsters to summon super

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.560
crashbug in defense mode.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.190
Super bugman: Super crash!

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.830
Oh, boy, that's a relief.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.490
For a second there, I thought
you were busting out some huge

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.030
monster in attack mode.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.390
Now why on earth would I go

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.760
and do something as ineffective

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.160
as that?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.560
When I can activate super
crashbug's special ability.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.490
Now all monsters in Attack mode

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.090
Swap their attack and
defense points!

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.930
Terror-Byte had 2900
defense points,

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.360
but now it's got 2900
attack points.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.990
Ahh... are you serious?

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.690
It was strong before, but...

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.330
aw man, and now my
monsters are weaker.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.290
And that means, it's the
perfect time to attack!

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.660
Go, terror-Byte.
Attack utopia!

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.090
-Don't Dodge this!
-I'm absolutely dodging it!

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.690
I'm activating utopia's ability.
By using up its last overlay

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.760
unit, I can stop your attack.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.460
-Nice.
-No, not nice.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.730
Now utopia's completely out of
overlay units!

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.330
Without those, yuma can't
prevent future attacks.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.690
I place one card facedown,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.130
and end my turn.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.430
I think I know what that
facedown card is.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.990
This will all be over
on my next turn.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.390
Computer: Viral release will
occur in

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.360
approximately five minutes.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.660
Terror-Byte is so much

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.290
stronger than my monsters now.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.630
Mr. Kay is right.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.830
If I don't beat him this turn,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.560
then I'm done for.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.730
Yuma, listen to me.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.230
Whatever you do, do not use

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.030
zubaba Knight and achacha Archer

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.160
to xyz summon leviathan Dragon.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.590
That is a bad idea.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:31.830
Oh yeah... that's right,
I've got another number card.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.890
And since you think
this is a bad idea,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.130
then I think it's the
perfect idea.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.390
Zubaba Knight: Zubaba Knight!

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.830
Now that my Knight is out and

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.390
about, I'm gonna overlay it with

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.090
achacha Archer to form the

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.590
overlay network.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.160
Mr. Kay, I'd like to introduce
you to number 17,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.560
leviathan Dragon.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.960
[roaring]

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.190
interesting.
But you seem to have forgotten

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.390
about the effect super crashbug

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.660
will have.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.830
Remember, the attack and defense

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.160
points of a monster in attack

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.590
mode are swapped.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.830
Which means your leviathan

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:19.830
Dragon now has zero
attack points.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.960
Ahh! All that effort and
excitement right down the drain.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.360
See, I told you that
was a bad idea.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.460
It's like when you told
me not to Dodge.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.290
If I had just stood
there, then... ooohh...

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.130
"don't Dodge this!"

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.690
that was bad advice,
even for him.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.930
"if you tell me that I should go
to the right, then I'm gonna

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.060
break to the left."

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.590
You were playing the opposite
game with me.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.930
You should activate Thunder
short from your hand, yuma.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.160
With that, your victory
will be assured.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.690
Argghh...

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.130
no games this time.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.590
If you don't do this,

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.290
I will vanish from this world.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.190
From my hand, I'm activating

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.860
the thunder short spell card!

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.430
Thunder Short dishes out 500

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.190
points of damage for every

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.660
monster you have.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.230
You can multiply big numbers,
right, Mr. Kay?

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.830
Arrghhh!

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.830
This isn't funny anymore.

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.630
Once again, I activate damage

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.390
vaccine Omega Max.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.960
And once again, just as I did

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.760
before, I regain life points

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.130
equal to the damage I took.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.130
I just can't make a
Dent in this guy.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.890
I think you are forgetting
about your trap card.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.690
Huh? My trap card?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.790
Oh Yeah.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.930
I activate the
overconfidence trap.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.760
The, the what?

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.660
Since you regained life
points, I can destroy your

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.130
monster, or to put it in a way

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.760
a math teacher would understand,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.660
what do you get when you
subtract super crashbug from

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.930
your field?

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.690
With super crashbug gone, all

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.390
the monsters on the field revert

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.960
back to their normal
attack and defense points.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.790
This can't be!

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.930
Now terror-Byte has no
attack points.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.160
Do your stuff,
leviathan Dragon.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.790
Attack with
Shock Stream blast!

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.660
Aargghh!

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.530
And now utopia's
gonna bring it home!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.690
Direct attack!

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.490
Rising Sun slash!

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.290
Aahhh!

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.890
Hooray!
You did it, yuma.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.360
A miraculous
come-From-Behind victory.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.630
[laughing and cheering]

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.830
I totally did it.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.630
I beat my math teacher.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.190
I'm somewhat amazed that we

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.930
pulled that off.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.160
Hey, how did you know
that Mr. Kay was gonna restore

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.190
his life points like that?

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.330
Your math teacher was
aiming for perfection.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.690
It became clear to me that your

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.330
teacher did not want to lose any

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.090
life points, that he would put

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.560
his desire to be perfect above

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.860
everything else.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.090
So I reasoned he was going to
try to regain his life points

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.660
even if he did not
need to at the time.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.360
This card contains a memory that

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.890
was once a part of me.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.960
Number 34...

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.160
I remember
the place where I came from.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.430
A different galaxy.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.060
Astral world.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.760
That is where I'm from.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.060
That is all I remember.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.630
Mr. Kay?

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.460
Mr. Kay. Wake up!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.030
What are all
you guys doing here?

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.960
Hurry! You said you'd stop the
viral countdown thing!

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.330
The viral countdown?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.630
I can't.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.990
The viral release doesn't have a

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.790
cancellation code.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.160
Are you serious?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.790
You mean the city is doomed?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.890
Haven't you
had enough?

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.490
Craaaash... bug!

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.360
I did it!

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.530
Huh? Why is the
clock still ticking?

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.260
Computer: 3... 2... 1...

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.280
aaaah!

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.230
Aahh, we're doomed!

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.230
It's all over.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.760
What are you guys shouting
about over here?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.830
Your virus!

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.930
Weren't you trying to crash the

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.390
city's systems and cause panic

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.590
and chaos?

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.760
Why would you think I'd
do something like that?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.030
Uh everything
does seem normal.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.160
I'll admit that during

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.460
my preparations, I accidentally

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.390
caused some trouble, but...

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.790
but what?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.760
What did that program
do just now?

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.390
Ah, there we are.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.730
You wanna know what I did?

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.390
Just put on your duel gazers and

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.990
look up at the sky.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.930
This is getting
weirder and weirder...

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.130
whoa!

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.930
What is... is that...

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.460
EVERYBODY: There's a giant
crashbug in the sky!

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.960
I was looking at the patterns

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.660
in the city's night lights, and

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.160
I noticed that they seemed to be

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.660
forming an incredibly complex

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.490
matrix code.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.030
With my duel gazer, I scanned

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.560
the pattern and realized it was

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.360
just one optical fragment away

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.260
from being an exact replica of

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.960
the crashbug q-Code.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.830
And I realized the museum's
dome isn't normally

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.090
lit up at night.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.490
So then all of this was just
you trying to turn on those

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.160
lights and make a giant crashbug
appear in the sky?

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.990
Yeah, you got it.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.560
Well that's weird.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.860
Yuma, look.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.590
Your crashbug card.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.490
You rubbing it in that you
beat me yesterday?

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.960
Read the description.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.690
Boy a: Whoa, it's crashbug!

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.330
Girl A: Crashbug is the best!

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.090
Everybody: Yeah, crashbug,
alright!

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.860
Guess maybe I just wasn't
meant to have a big

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.190
scoop this week.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.430
Crashbug is an electric

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.890
spirit that eats the bugs in our

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.330
lives. Sadness, doubt,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.360
frustration, no bug is too big

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.760
for crashbug!"

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.730
"if you see crashbug on
the night of a full

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.360
moon, it brings you good luck."

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.190
Don't you get it yet?
In the end, Mr. Kay

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:17.490
just wanted everyone to
have good luck.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.690
Observation number 7:

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.630
Number cards affect people.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.290
They change them.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.890
They seem to amplify

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.390
their individual wants

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.560
and desires, almost to the point

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.560
that they take over.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.530
I need to remember that.
