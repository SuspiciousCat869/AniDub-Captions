00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.816
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal..."

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:05.594
(man on TV)
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:08.215
<i>People around the world are</i>
losing their minds.

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.117
Welcome to Freakopolis.

00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:11.852
All this chaos is the result

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:14.688
of people picking up
Number Cards.

00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:16.223
(all) Number Cards?

00:00:16.223 --> 00:00:16.991
See for yourselves.

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:19.226
How people got the Numbers
is a mystery.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.095
Whoever is behind this...

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:22.896
Are experts in mind control.

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:23.864
The Barians.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.000
What's so serious
that you had to call

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.603
an emergency meeting of
the Imperial Council?

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:32.206
No!
That couldn't be!

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:33.640
Nash?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.209
But that's impossible!

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:38.045
He's really alive?

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:41.815
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:50.157
Since this world is slowly
transforming into Barian World,

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.526
this duel will be
just like dueling

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:53.927
in a Barian Sphere Field.

00:00:53.927 --> 00:00:58.232
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.200
Number One!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.572
Behold, Infection Buzzking!

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:09.109
Aah!

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:11.745
(gasping)

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:16.517
Looks like he's done,
so that means I'm the winner!

00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:20.220
(Yuma)
You're celebrating too soon!

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:27.127
Aah!

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.098
We're back...

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:34.735
and ready to get in
on the action.

You're supposed to be trapped
in another dimension!

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.770
They're both safe!

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.505
I can't believe it!

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.241
I just knew you'd rush back here
to see me, Yuma!

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.843
I haven't been this happy
since finals week!

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:51.812
Welcome back, guys.
(chuckles)

00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:54.748
Thanks a lot.
We missed you all, too.

00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:57.584
Look, Yuma.
Kite is down.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.219
Kite!

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.655
Kite, are you all right?

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:02.456
Give me a sign!

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:07.227
Hey!
You gotta wake up, buddy!

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.864
What took you so long?

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:12.733
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:16.236
That's okay.

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:18.238
Wake up!

00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:20.240
(thinking)
I'll make this right.

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:24.211
(speaking)
Quinton, look after him, please.

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:25.746
Do not worry.

00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:28.015
Heartland did this.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:29.149
I'm gonna make you sorry

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.685
you ever came back here
and messed with us!

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:34.755
Yeah?
And how will you do that?

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.990
Here's how.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.926
I'll duel in Kite's place.

00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.528
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:42.663
I enjoyed crushing Kite,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:46.900
but taking you down will be
my crowning achievement!

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.235
After sealing this victory,

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:53.240
I'm sure to become one of the
seven Emperors of Barian world!

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.210
To celebrate,
I'm going full Barian!

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.645
What do you think
of my new form?

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:01.081
Doesn't it make you
purple with envy?

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.785
You're revolting no matter
what you look like.

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.954
Uhh!

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:10.190
Duel Disk, go!

00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:13.227
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:19.833
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:26.607
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:28.675
If it's a duel you want,

00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:30.811
it's a duel you'll get.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.816
Aah!

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:37.117
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:39.953
What are you up to,
you Barian bozo?

00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:43.190
Barian World is assimilating
your world,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.727
turning it into a gigantic
Barian Field.

00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:52.666
The power of the Barians is
truly shocking, isn't it?

00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:53.834
(groaning)

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.535
Astral, are you okay?

00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:58.005
This Barian field is strong,

00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:00.907
but it will not be enough
to defeat us.

00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:02.209
Ready?
You know it!

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.212
Even when Kite's down,
he's still got my back,

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:07.648
because he left me
Prevent and Draw

00:05:07.648 --> 00:05:09.483
which lets me draw one card!

00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:12.919
And I know
it's gonna be a good one!

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:13.787
Hyah!

00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:16.723
Kuri, Kuri!
Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:05:16.723 --> 00:05:18.025
A useless card.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:20.961
It can't help you survive
my final strike!

00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:24.231
Infection Buzzking, attack!

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.233
It's not happening, Heartland!

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.568
Get him, Kuriboh!

00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:29.536
Kuri, Kuri!

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:31.238
This little guy
may look harmless,

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:32.939
but it's a powerful protector!

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.677
Its special ability stops
Infection Buzzking's attack!

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:39.680
Nice going, Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:48.021
You're safe for now, but you
won't be for much longer...

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:51.224
and neither will Kite!

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:57.230
Nash and Marin!

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.932
Impossible!

00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:00.000
They survived?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.003
I was sure I got rid of them
both a long time ago.

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:05.605
Are you not happy
to see them, Vector?

00:06:05.605 --> 00:06:06.740
Of course I am!

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.210
They assumed human forms
and identities on Earth.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.713
In that world, they were
our enemies,

00:06:12.713 --> 00:06:15.048
Reginald and Rio Kastle.

00:06:15.048 --> 00:06:16.016
What?

00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:18.585
They were Shark and Rio?

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:19.119
Precisely.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.122
They had no memory of their
lives as Barians

00:06:22.122 --> 00:06:24.891
and truly believed
that they were humans.

00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.594
This situation is bad,
very bad.

00:06:27.594 --> 00:06:29.229
If they remember
what I did to them,

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.765
they're gonna be looking
for some payback!

00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:34.568
Calm yourself, Vector.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:34.968
Don Thousand!

00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:39.673
Nash or Marin do not know
all that you did to them.

00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:40.474
Fortunately for you,

00:06:40.474 --> 00:06:44.211
some memories still
remain in the shadows.

00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.479
Vector.
Huh?

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.882
You must be suspicious
of Marin and me.

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:49.583
I can understand that.

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:53.720
After all, when we were in human
form, we were your enemies.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.957
We have now returned to our
true Barian forms, however.

00:06:56.957 --> 00:06:59.926
And I am committed to leading
you and the other emperors

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:01.228
to defend our home world.

00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:03.897
I am convinced that
with our combined powers,

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:04.698
we will succeed.

00:07:04.698 --> 00:07:07.868
But if any of you doubt my
loyalty to the Barians,

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:11.138
I invite you to challenge me
right now!

00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:11.805
Nash,

00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:15.208
Marin and I stand with you,
our fellow emperors!

00:07:15.208 --> 00:07:18.779
We will fight for the Barians!

00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:21.548
Oh, joy.

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:22.549
Now that that's settled,

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:23.717
we have another matter
to attend to.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:28.221
Someone is trying to fuse Barian
World with the human world.

00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.189
I'm shocked.

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.160
Such an enterprise requires
incredible energy, Vector.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.495
Only the great deity
Don Thousand

00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:36.496
possessed such power.

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:40.233
Who do you think
could have revived him?

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:42.836
I don't know, but they
should be congratulated.

00:07:42.836 --> 00:07:46.239
Perhaps it was the work of
a little fly I rescued.

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.074
You mean Heartland?

00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:49.009
Exactly!

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:50.210
This must be his doing!

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.678
With Astral and Yuma
out of the picture,

00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:55.148
this is the perfect opportunity
to strike at the human...

00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:56.149
Vector.
Huh?

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:00.887
You should not underestimate
Yuma and Astral.

00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:02.122
Why's that?

00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:04.224
Those two never submit.

00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:04.958
No matter what,

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.961
I am sure they will return
if they haven't already.

00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:09.663
Here.

00:08:09.663 --> 00:08:11.231
I offer you my power.

00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:15.235
Use my strength
to take them down.

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:18.238
Show no mercy!

00:08:22.476 --> 00:08:24.177
Here goes!

00:08:24.177 --> 00:08:25.212
Hyah!

00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:27.180
Ready?
All set!

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.215
First...

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:33.487
I'm gonna summon Gagaga Ceasar!

00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:39.659
And that lets me summon
Gagaga Clerk to join it.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.966
It's time to get this thing
started!

00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:47.667
Gagaga Ceasar will
start things off

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:51.037
by giving its special ability
a whirl!

00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:53.807
By banishing a monster
in our graveyard,

00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.742
the levels of all our monsters
on our field

00:08:55.742 --> 00:08:59.846
become the same as the level of
the monster that was banished.

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:03.216
Caesar, go ahead and banish
Paladin of Photon Dragon

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.853
so you can raise both your
Levels to four!

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:09.723
I'm really feelin'
the flow now!

00:09:09.723 --> 00:09:13.560
Next, I'll overlay both
of my Gagagas!

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.230
Okay, you two, let's build
the Overlay Network!

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.499
Time to turn this duel around!

00:09:19.499 --> 00:09:25.005
I Xyz Summon Number 39, Utopia!

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.079
Strike now.
Yeah.

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:37.217
Utopia, take out
Infection Buzzking!

00:09:37.217 --> 00:09:37.884
Wait!

00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:41.021
Utopia is not as powerful
as Heartland's monster!

00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.023
I wasn't hatched
yesterday, Yuma!

00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:44.658
You're gonna stop
Utopia's attack

00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:46.760
so that you can then
double its attack points

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.495
with the spell
Double or Nothing!

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.063
I saw you do
the exact same thing

00:09:50.063 --> 00:09:52.198
during the World Duel Carnival!

00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.201
Watch and weep
as I tear your plan to shreds.

00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:57.971
I play the trap Overlay Hunt!

00:09:57.971 --> 00:10:00.240
Thanks for attacking
my Xyz Monster

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.841
with an Xyz Monster
of your own!

00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:04.611
Because your monster's
abilities are now nixed.

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.613
And that's not all,
Infection Buzzking

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:09.215
snatches away all of
Utopia's Overlay Units.

00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:13.219
That means Utopia
won't have any Overlay Units
to stop its attack!

00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:15.221
Since Utopia's attack
continues,

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.725
Infection Buzzking's
taking out Utopia.

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:20.894
I tanked your plan.

00:10:20.894 --> 00:10:22.562
Only one of our plans.

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:27.233
Since you already figured out
plan A, we'll use plan B.

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:27.968
B?

00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:31.671
We have more than one way to
stop Utopia's attack.

00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:32.472
Check this out!

00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:35.475
I'm activating the spell
Stop Hammer!

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:38.211
(Astral)
We have the power to stop
Utopia's attack

00:10:38.445 --> 00:10:41.748
by reducing its
attack points by 500.

00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:47.220
And now, like you expected,

00:10:47.454 --> 00:10:51.224
I'll activate
Double Or Nothing!

00:10:51.224 --> 00:10:52.592
Oh, no!

00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:55.495
(Astral)
When Utopia's attack
is stopped,

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:56.229
it can attack again,

00:10:56.463 --> 00:11:00.133
but this time with double
the attack points.

00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:04.204
Ready, Utopia?

00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:06.239
Then attack Infection Buzzking,

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:08.241
and this time I won't stop you!

00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:12.646
Go Rising Sun Twin Blade Slash!

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:19.853
Aah!

00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:24.224
Oh, yeah!

00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:25.925
Now that the battle is over,

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:29.796
Utopia's attack points once
again return to normal.

00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:34.234
All right, I'm not
playing nice anymore!

00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:37.737
In fact, I'm gonna get
downright nasty!

00:11:37.737 --> 00:11:41.474
For starters, I'll activate
the trap Infection Medium!

00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:44.144
You may have destroyed
Infection Buzzking,

00:11:44.144 --> 00:11:47.480
but it's leaving a bunch of
creepy crawlers behind,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.217
and they're buzzing with
excitement to do my dirty work!

00:11:51.217 --> 00:11:53.219
Individually, they are weak,

00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:55.221
but we must keep our guard up.

00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:56.156
No doubt.

00:11:56.156 --> 00:11:59.893
Heartland, I end my turn
with a facedown.

00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:00.593
Your move.

00:12:00.593 --> 00:12:02.962
It will be my pleasure, Yuma.

00:12:02.962 --> 00:12:03.563
I draw!

00:12:03.563 --> 00:12:07.233
Now I'll play my first
Infection Bug token.

00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:10.236
It will attack Utopia.

00:12:11.237 --> 00:12:14.074
Why is it attacking
when it's so weak?

00:12:19.212 --> 00:12:21.648
Thanks to Bug Token's
special ability,

00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:23.850
not only don't I take
any damage,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.220
but I can also instantly
eradicate your monster!

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.789
Plus, to add to your misery,

00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:33.226
your life points
take a 300-point hit!

00:12:33.226 --> 00:12:35.895
Uhh!

00:12:36.996 --> 00:12:40.033
With Utopia gone, you're
completely defenseless.

00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:45.238
Bug Token number two will now
attack you directly!

00:12:45.238 --> 00:12:49.209
I use Rainbow Kuribow's
special ability!

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:50.210
Since you're attacking me,

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.646
I can summon Rainbow Kuriboh
from my graveyard.

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:55.115
It will make no difference.

00:12:55.115 --> 00:12:59.719
My Token's taking out
your Kuriboh!

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:02.222
Rainbow Kuriboh!
You saved me!

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:04.190
That puny monster
didn't save you,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.060
it just delayed your destruction
by a few seconds.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.728
Bug Tokens three,
four, and five

00:13:08.728 --> 00:13:10.463
are gonna attack
one after another

00:13:10.463 --> 00:13:13.533
and continue their assault
against you! Ha!

00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:16.236
Move out, my bug swarm.

00:13:16.236 --> 00:13:18.071
Attack!

00:13:21.474 --> 00:13:24.711
Aah!
Aah!

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.219
I'm not finished.

00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:35.021
You're teetering
on the edge of defeat,

00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:38.691
and I'll give you a push
with Infection Extension!

00:13:38.691 --> 00:13:40.827
Think of this spell
as a "token"

00:13:40.827 --> 00:13:42.962
of my loathing for you
and Astral.

00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:46.232
It lets me summon one
Infection Bug Token!

00:13:46.232 --> 00:13:49.235
Too bad we don't have some
insect repellant.

00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:50.236
I should also mention

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:52.772
that once Infection Extension
is activated,

00:13:52.772 --> 00:13:55.041
you can only summon your
monsters in attack mode!

00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:58.211
That means Yuma's gonna have a
hard time protecting himself!

00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:02.215
Don't forget that if your
monster destroys my Bug Token,

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:04.717
your monster will
also be destroyed,

00:14:04.717 --> 00:14:07.220
and you'll lose
300 life points!

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.087
(sinister laugh)

00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:10.223
Heartland's got Yuma
boxed in good.

00:14:10.456 --> 00:14:13.226
Yuma cannot go on
the offensive.

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:15.228
If he does, he's doomed.

00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:17.063
What will you do, Yuma?

00:14:17.063 --> 00:14:20.200
Astral and I will do
what we always do...

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.167
keep fighting!

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:22.735
Since you brought out
that Bug Token,

00:14:22.735 --> 00:14:24.237
I can make a move
you didn't expect.

00:14:24.237 --> 00:14:26.706
Let me shed some light
on what it is.

00:14:26.706 --> 00:14:30.610
I activate
the trap Returning Light!

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.744
This trap lets me summon

00:14:31.744 --> 00:14:34.180
a Light Attribute monster
from our graveyard.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.817
And all I have to do
is lower its attack points
by a thousand!

00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:41.221
And I know which monster
Yuma's bringing back.

00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:43.890
Yeah, yeah!
Master Kite's go-to!

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.494
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon,
welcome back!

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.633
No matter how powerful
your Dragon is,

00:14:53.633 --> 00:14:56.236
it's still five-on-one, Yuma!

00:14:56.236 --> 00:14:58.037
Our situation is dire,

00:14:58.037 --> 00:15:01.441
but there is still a way
we can rebound and win this.

00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:03.209
Yeah, I know.

00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:06.913
This whole duel
is riding on my next draw.

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:08.748
We need just the right card.

00:15:08.748 --> 00:15:10.884
(sinister laugh)

00:15:10.884 --> 00:15:12.218
Give it up, Yuma.

00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:13.519
I know what you're
trying to pull.

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:16.823
You won't "Zexal"
your way out of this mess.

00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:20.526
See, I have something
even stronger!

00:15:20.526 --> 00:15:22.061
Barian power!

00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:27.927
I call upon the darkest forces
of Barian World!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.037
(rumbling)

00:15:31.037 --> 00:15:32.238
(all gasping)

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:38.211
Feel Barian World's wrath!

00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:40.747
Aah!

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:42.882
(sinister laugh)

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:45.218
Stop! What are you
doing to them?

00:15:45.218 --> 00:15:46.019
I'm weakening them!

00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:49.689
Now they won't have enough
strength to work together.

00:15:53.693 --> 00:15:56.796
You're wrong, Heartland.

00:15:56.796 --> 00:15:59.532
Impossible!
I'm always right!

00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:01.234
It doesn't matter
what you throw at us.

00:16:01.467 --> 00:16:05.204
Nothing can stop Astral and me
from working as a team!

00:16:05.204 --> 00:16:08.908
Astral, this is it.

00:16:08.908 --> 00:16:09.809
No way!

00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:12.812
You should both be
totally wiped out!

00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:13.613
We're not!

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:19.118
(both)
Together, we will
high-five the sky!

00:16:27.026 --> 00:16:29.796
(Astral)
When two distant souls
become one,

00:16:29.796 --> 00:16:32.799
the power of Zexal is revealed!

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.601
(both) Go Zexal Morph!

00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:43.509
You are going down.

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:45.611
Heartland...

00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:48.214
it's over!

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:54.587
Amazing.

00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:57.924
It's like new and improved.

00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:03.730
All my power couldn't stop you!

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.098
Your power comes from hate,

00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:08.067
but the power of Zexal comes
from friendship,

00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:10.203
and that's a lot stronger,
Heartland,

00:17:10.203 --> 00:17:13.106
and you're about to
find out how strong!

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:14.073
No way!

00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:16.976
My Barian Field's
been destroyed!

00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:18.611
It's time.

00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:19.879
I draw!

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:22.949
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:27.153
He can even generate the very
card that he needs to draw.

00:17:27.153 --> 00:17:32.091
When you feel the flow,
duelist and deck become one.

00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:35.928
Go Shining Draw!

00:17:36.662 --> 00:17:38.731
That is so totally awesome.

00:17:38.731 --> 00:17:39.899
Yes, Yuma, it is.

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:41.534
Heartland, it's over!

00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:46.005
'Cause I'm summoning
ZS Vanish Sage!

00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:50.109
You don't realize it yet,

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:53.212
but we're about to mangle
your master plan!

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:54.914
Go, Galaxy Eyes!

00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:59.218
Pick a Bug Token, then
go ahead and take it out.

00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:01.621
(growling)

00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:02.722
(roaring)

00:18:02.722 --> 00:18:06.225
I activate Galaxy-Eyes'
special ability!

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:09.929
Both of our monsters
are banished!

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.066
Way to go, Yuma!
What a super move!

00:18:13.066 --> 00:18:16.235
They've got Heartland
exactly where they need him.

00:18:16.469 --> 00:18:19.038
Huh. So you got rid
of one bug.

00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:19.939
I've still got four left,

00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:22.842
and Galaxy-Eyes can't use
that trick again!

00:18:22.842 --> 00:18:23.609
Oh, yeah?

00:18:23.609 --> 00:18:26.079
I activate Vanish Sage's
special ability.

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:27.747
I banish Vanish Sage

00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:31.818
to bring back Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:41.494
(roaring)

00:18:41.894 --> 00:18:44.630
With Galaxy-Eyes back,
you're finally finished,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.632
'cause all monsters with
fewer attack points

00:18:46.632 --> 00:18:51.104
than Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon
are banished!

00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:52.238
Oh, no!

00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:53.573
That's right, Heartland.

00:18:53.573 --> 00:18:56.609
Since Galaxy-Eyes
has 3,000 attack points,

00:18:56.609 --> 00:18:58.211
it gets rid of your Bug Tokens.

00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:01.848
You've got nothing
to protect yourself with.

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:08.588
Yuma!

00:19:08.588 --> 00:19:12.191
All right, Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon,

00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:14.927
attack Heartland directly!

00:19:14.927 --> 00:19:15.561
Uhh!

00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:19.565
Go Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:26.038
Aah!

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:36.215
That was the best
comeback ever!

00:19:39.218 --> 00:19:41.521
You'll pay for this!

00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:42.955
Just you wait!

00:19:42.955 --> 00:19:46.192
Once the Barian Emperor's
hear what you did...

00:19:46.192 --> 00:19:49.795
Uhh!

00:19:57.236 --> 00:19:59.005
My cards!

00:19:59.005 --> 00:20:00.239
Wait, no!

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:01.073
No!

00:20:01.073 --> 00:20:03.042
What's happening to me?

00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:04.210
Vector, give me
a second chance!

00:20:04.443 --> 00:20:07.547
I can beat them,
best two out of three!

00:20:07.547 --> 00:20:11.784
Aah! Aah!
(sinister laugh)

00:20:11.784 --> 00:20:12.785
It is you!

00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:15.488
(sinsister laugh)

00:20:15.488 --> 00:20:18.691
What was that, Astral?
Heartland's number?

00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:22.528
No, it was the Barian,
Don Thousand.

00:20:22.528 --> 00:20:24.597
Great.

00:20:24.597 --> 00:20:27.466
(thinking) Don Thousand.

00:20:29.235 --> 00:20:30.570
Guys!

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.171
That was Zexal-utionary!

00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:35.208
Heartland hit you with every
trick he could think up.

00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:36.709
But you played him perfectly!

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:38.644
Thank goodness you
returned in time.

00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:42.215
I'm so happy you two are
home safe and sound.

00:20:42.215 --> 00:20:43.216
We are, too.

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:45.484
It's great to be back home.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.688
(groaning)

00:20:48.688 --> 00:20:51.057
Oh, Master Kite!
Are you okay?

00:20:51.057 --> 00:20:53.125
That depends on
who won the duel.

00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:58.030
It was Yuma and Astral
in a blowout.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.067
Flip was taken up
to Barian World?

00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:03.236
Uh-huh.

00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:05.204
There's only one thing to do.

00:21:05.204 --> 00:21:08.241
We gotta take down the Barians.

00:21:08.241 --> 00:21:11.811
Look!

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:09.895
