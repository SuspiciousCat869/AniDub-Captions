WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.079
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...
You and your friends
are doomed...

00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:07.348
doomed...

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:09.519
because of you!

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.989
You're through,
Yuma.

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.893
There's nothing
left for you.

00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:14.997
(Caswell)
I can't believe
Ray was a Barian.

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:17.603
I can't believe Yuma knew it
and kept it a secret from us!

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:21.009
I'm really
sorry!

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.013
Yuma.

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:25.017
Together we
can do this.

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:26.955
(both)
Go Zexal Morph!

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.830
(Vector)
Astral, do you really think
you can be one with Yuma?

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:35.038
After what he's done,
how can you ever trust him?

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:39.815
Don't listen
to him!

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:41.418
Your bond
is no more!

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:45.961
When two distant souls
become one,

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.798
the power of
Zexal is revealed...

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.836
Astral, stop.

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:51.038
Something's happened
to you!

00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:52.675
Correct!

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:53.910
My eyes have been
opened to the truth.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.914
Oh no!

00:00:55.914 --> 00:00:57.050
No!

(Yuma)
Where...

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:18.017
Wait, I know
where.

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.357
I got
pulled into--

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:22.960
Hold up.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.828
Astral.

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.134
What is that...?

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:29.740
Astral?

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.448
I gotta
go find him.

00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:35.419
Astral!

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:43.169
(gasping)

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.404
Well,
well, well.

00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:46.175
It seems the power
of Zexal

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.179
has taken a
turn for the worse.

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:51.151
(Yuma)
Astral...

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.657
Astral I gotta make
this right.

00:02:53.657 --> 00:02:55.427
I'm so sorry...

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:56.796
I'm so sorry I kept
the truth about Ray a secret.

00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:01.139
Yuma, you have
betrayed me.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.545
Your dishonesty has
destroyed my trust in you.

00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:07.719
(rumbling)

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.198
It's my move.

00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:15.735
Now let's see what kind
of trouble I can summon up.

00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:21.213
Dark Draw!

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:24.186
Oh please...

00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:26.190
First I summon...

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.860
Darx Zexal Weapon
Chimera Clad!

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:36.645
Now witness the dark power of
Chimera Clad's special ability!

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.887
This card destroys your
trap Vain Betrayer!

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.697
And now that that
card has been vanquished,

00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:48.570
Chimera Clad equips on
to Utopia Ray V!

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.244
When Utopia Ray V is
equipped with Chimera Clad,

00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:55.250
it loses its special
abilities,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.221
but its dark power
makes it invincible.

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:03.199
Utopia Ray V
finish Masquerade!

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:11.650
What?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.886
What are you
thinking?

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:14.656
Masquerade has
more attack points!

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:17.262
Even if Utopia Ray V
isn't destroyed,

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:20.067
you still
take damage!

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:23.708
Thanks to Chimera Clad's
special ability,

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:26.046
when I take
damage from battle,

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:27.683
Utopia Ray V can attack again
with double its attack points.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.758
Dark Charge!

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:32.994
It can?

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:37.269
Utopia Ray V attack
Masquerade again!

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:41.278
I activate the trap
Extra Hundred!

00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:45.119
Thanks to this trap, you
can't destroy my monster!

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.541
Unfortunately...

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.043
your Utopia Ray V
can attack again.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:01.720
Utopia Ray V,
take out Masquerade!

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.294
I activate Extra Hundred's
other effect!

00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:09.102
Now when Masquerade
is attacked,

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:11.039
its attack points become
100 more than your monster!

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:24.333
I don't care if it's
a 100 or a 1,000!

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.105
I double Utopia Ray V's attack
points and attack you again!

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:32.249
Utopia Ray V
you know what to do!

00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:36.291
Extra Hundred's effect
activates!

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.568
So you take
damage once again.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.313
(Vector)
He's lost his mind...
he's destroying himself!

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:50.353
And that makes my job
so much easier...

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.992
Yuma, I now realize that
you are a devious individual.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:04.569
Your actions have stained my
spirit with sadness,

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.743
doubt and anger.

00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:09.780
(growling)

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:15.245
Let's do this again,
shall we?

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:17.616
Dark Charge!

00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:19.386
Utopia Ray V,
attack Masquerade!

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:22.660
The fact is...

00:06:24.397 --> 00:06:25.966
I can no longer
trust you.

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:31.144
(Flip)
Guys, this is
absolutely disastrous!

00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:33.950
If Yuma keeps this up and he
gets down to 500 life points,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.390
Sargasso's effect's gonna
wipe him out!

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.296
Yuma!

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.331
You have
to stop this!

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.077
??

00:06:48.413 --> 00:06:50.083
Astral.

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.425
Yuma.

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:56.228
Why are
you here?

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:58.066
I...

00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:59.436
I wanted to come
here and say sorry to you.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:02.275
There is no need
for that.

00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:05.815
You betrayed me by
keeping your friendship

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:08.320
with a Barian secret...

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.324
so I lost my
trust in you.

00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:14.099
But as a result, I have
acquired a new power.

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:19.944
Evil, Yuma.

00:07:19.944 --> 00:07:21.347
Evil.

00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:24.420
Now I see.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.923
Your betrayal and your lies
have created within me

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:29.096
the power
of anger.

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:30.098
Let's do
this again!

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:35.476
Utopia Ray V, do
what you do best!

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.998
Please, stop!

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.400
One more attack and
it'll be all over for Yuma!

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.741
Look, Yuma--
Just look at me!

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.482
I am filled with
so much power!

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:57.488
I want more
lying, more betrayal.

00:07:57.488 --> 00:07:59.492
They lead to doubt, anger.

00:07:59.492 --> 00:08:01.329
The hatred they create
within me

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:03.133
will then even
give me more power!

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.072
Astral...

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:07.341
I did this!

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.811
This is my fault!

00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:10.348
So true, and I
am grateful to you.

00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:14.523
You brought about this
transformation in me.

00:08:14.757 --> 00:08:16.862
Now the darkness that
is within me gives me power

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.537
to destroy anything
I desire!

00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:24.811
The darkness
fuels my anger

00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:27.115
and my wrath will
conquer all!

00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:30.322
No!

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:32.026
(laughing)

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.817
(screaming)

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:46.289
Dark Charge!

00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:47.791
Yes, attack me
and seal your doom!

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:52.765
(gasping)

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:07.817
(screaming)

00:09:07.817 --> 00:09:09.287
What?

00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:10.323
(screaming)

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.026
Astral!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.193
Yuma, listen.

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:22.396
You have to stop
Utopia Ray V's attack!

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:25.398
Stop it now, Yuma, or
it's all over!

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.104
I end my turn!

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:34.641
Fine.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.444
Then suffer
Sargasso's effect.

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.347
Astral!

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:50.635
You only have 100
life points left...

00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:53.074
and you're down to
your last card!

00:09:53.074 --> 00:09:55.344
And speaking of down, your
friend's looking a little down

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.384
on his luck, Yuma.

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:00.154
Just give up.

00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:02.258
(Yuma)
No... never!

00:10:02.258 --> 00:10:05.799
There's no way you
can stop me.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.173
Yuma...

00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:11.946
Have it
your way.

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:14.217
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Barian's Force!

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:22.901
I rank up Masquerade
into a Chaos Xyz Monster!

00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:27.844
I overlay Rank 4 Masquerade!

00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:32.220
With it, I rebuild
the Overlay Network!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.226
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:10:40.237 --> 00:10:44.179
Appear Chaos Number 104:
Umbral Horror Masquerade!

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.414
Vector's Chaos Number!

00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:03.451
Due to Barian's Force,
my Chaos Xyz Monster

00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:07.459
absorbs all of
Utopia Ray V's Overlay Units.

00:11:12.437 --> 00:11:16.077
Since it took one
Overlay Unit,

00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:17.914
your monster now
loses 300 attack points!

00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:21.688
And things only get worse
because Umbral Horror Masquerade

00:11:22.992 --> 00:11:26.465
destroys one of your spell
or trap cards!

00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:29.705
I destroy
Chimera Clad!

00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:33.847
Destroy Step!

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:36.219
Oh no,
Chimera Clad!

00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:41.195
It appears that shaving
away your own life points

00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:43.701
to raise Utopia Ray V's attack
points has all gone to waste!

00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:48.277
You're done!

00:11:48.277 --> 00:11:50.047
Umbral Horror Masquerade,
attack Utopia Ray V!

00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:55.491
Yuma!

00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:57.295
I activate the trap card
Xyz Revenge Shuffle!

00:11:58.765 --> 00:12:02.339
I won't let you
destroy Utopia Ray V!

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:04.978
I send it back to my deck
and I take no damage!

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:09.120
But I'm
not done yet.

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:12.526
Unfortunately,

00:12:12.526 --> 00:12:13.896
your Umbral Horror Masquerade
gets to attack again.

00:12:13.896 --> 00:12:16.802
But lucky for me, I get
to summon an Xyz Monster

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.508
from my graveyard to take
Utopia Ray V's place!

00:12:19.908 --> 00:12:23.349
So I summon Utopia!

00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:25.153
You forgot.

00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:27.524
If you summon
an Xyz Monster,

00:12:27.524 --> 00:12:29.528
Sargasso's effect will
finish you off!

00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:32.534
I activate Interceptomato's
special ability

00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:35.006
from the graveyard!

00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:36.375
By banishing this card, I
don't take damage from Sargasso,

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:39.482
so I'm still alive and
kicking your butt!

00:12:40.216 --> 00:12:42.388
This changes nothing!

00:12:43.557 --> 00:12:45.127
My Masquearade
will attack Utopia

00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:46.563
and finish you
off anyway!

00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:48.467
(Yuma)
If I had an Overlay Unit,
I could stop the attack.

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:52.175
I banish Spell Recycler
from my graveyard

00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:54.547
to activate its
special ability!

00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:57.553
That lets me send one card from
my deck to the graveyard

00:12:57.553 --> 00:13:00.826
to return the spell card
at the bottom of my graveyard

00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:03.398
back to my deck.

00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:05.402
(Yuma)
I memorized all
the cards I played

00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:07.106
and the ones Vector sent
to the graveyard.

00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:09.578
So if I
remember correctly,

00:13:09.578 --> 00:13:11.180
the final card in my deck is
the card I need now to win.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.488
I hope I'm right.

00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:16.225
I am!

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:17.594
I discard Xyz Agent
to retrieve a spell card

00:13:17.594 --> 00:13:20.600
and put it back
into my deck!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.205
Whatever!

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:24.574
Umbral Horror Masquerade,
finish this!

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.082
My Xyz Agent's
special ability

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.324
activates when it's in the
graveyard, Vector!

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:34.595
Huh?

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:36.599
By banishing
Xyz Agent,

00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:38.403
Utopia can activate
its special ability

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.607
without using an
Overlay Unit!

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:48.891
Go Light Wing Shield!

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:51.330
Your friend managed to survive,
but he will not next turn.

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:58.611
Still, for some reason,
you believe he will win.

00:14:00.348 --> 00:14:03.622
Yes, I do.

00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:05.291
Tell me... Why?

00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.628
Because I've seen Yuma duel
and he never gives up!

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:09.901
Your friend is in
for rude awakening!

00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:12.373
Still thinking you
have a chance?

00:14:14.644 --> 00:14:16.648
Well I'll use Umbral's
special ability to fix that!

00:14:17.116 --> 00:14:20.657
By using one Chaos
Overlay Unit,

00:14:20.657 --> 00:14:23.161
not only do I send a card
in your hand to the graveyard,

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:26.469
but you also lose half
your life points!

00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:29.141
So I'll think I'll use two Chaos
Overlay Units to double the fun!

00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:38.494
Say bye-bye to two cards
that you can't afford to lose!

00:14:39.362 --> 00:14:43.237
You have 25 life points,
one card in your deck,

00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:47.679
and no cards
in your hand.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.917
Still think you
have a chance?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.200
You seem a
little distracted.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.339
Are you not worried
about your friend?

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:03.712
Why should
I worry?

00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:05.215
I'm not the one who's
going up against Yuma.

00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:08.388
The one who should be
worried is Vector.

00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:11.461
(Vector)
This'll finish
him off.

00:15:11.461 --> 00:15:13.699
Barian Explosion deals
1,000 points of damage

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:16.939
for every Barian card
in Yuma's hand.

00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:19.678
Ta, ta Yuma!

00:15:19.678 --> 00:15:21.348
I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.221
Well?

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:26.125
It's you move.

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.293
But is it really
worth taking?

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.534
You've lost this duel
and your good friend, Astral.

00:15:32.738 --> 00:15:36.379
Maybe you're right.

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:37.748
I lost Astral because
I bought into your lies

00:15:37.748 --> 00:15:40.521
but you're wrong about
me losing this duel.

00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:43.493
No matter what dirty trick
you have planned for me,

00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:46.232
I still
believe in hope.

00:15:46.232 --> 00:15:48.738
Nothing you do can
change that...

00:15:48.738 --> 00:15:51.142
and that's what's
gonna defeat you.

00:15:51.277 --> 00:15:54.984
You should listen
to yourself, Yuma!

00:15:54.984 --> 00:15:57.756
Your belief is based
on a lie!

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.061
The only hope
you have left

00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:01.564
is that card from a "friend"
that didn't exist.

00:16:03.535 --> 00:16:07.042
Yeah I guess
that's true.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:09.781
But right now I'm dueling
for a real friend.

00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:13.522
I have to believe
in hope and draw.

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:16.428
This is for Astral!

00:16:22.073 --> 00:16:25.347
Yuma, no!

00:16:25.347 --> 00:16:26.782
Yuma.

00:16:26.782 --> 00:16:27.784
I'm so sorry.

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:32.127
Yuma, I can no longer
trust you as I did before.

00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:35.801
And yet, despite all
that has happened,

00:16:38.507 --> 00:16:41.813
I still have not lost my
faith in your spirit of hope.

00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:47.058
Yuma.

00:16:47.058 --> 00:16:48.193
Astral.

00:16:48.193 --> 00:16:49.763
Let's high five
the sky!

00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:53.103
No!

00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:57.078
The time is now.

00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:58.615
Let's do this.

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:05.495
(Astral)
When two hearts join together
in the spirit of hope,

00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:08.568
nothing is impossible!

00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:10.607
(both)
Go Zexal Morph!

00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:23.665
It's over Vector!

00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:26.766
(cheering)

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.221
That's quite
the getup!

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.856
But it
changes nothing.

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.391
You can dress up anyway you
like, but you still won't win!

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:42.428
We'll see
about that.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.465
It's time for me to unleash
the true power of this card

00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:48.468
and shine the light
on victory!

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:51.037
Shining Evolution!

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.042
What?

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.310
They changed
the card!

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.446
The light of hope
shatters the darkness

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.816
and calls forth Limited Barian's
Force's true form!

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:07.620
I activate
Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force!

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:13.025
This card ranks up Utopia
into a Chaos Xyz Monster.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:17.997
I rebuild the Overlay
Network with Utopia!

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.767
Go Chaos Xyz
Evolution.

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:26.705
Appear,

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:27.873
Chaos Number 39:
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:49.929
Utopia Ray Victory?

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.064
I think not!

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.666
Sargasso's effect
will finish you!

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:57.436
The only one finished
here is you, Vector!

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.039
When Numeron Force
is activated,

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.607
it negates
Sargasso's effect!

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:04.043
No!

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.313
Now Utopia Ray Victory attack
Umbral Horror Masquerade!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:11.383
I activate Utopia Ray
Victory's special ability!

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:14.720
By using one
Overlay Unit,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.388
Utopia Ray Victory gains
your monster's attack points!

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.025
Victory Charge!

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:28.000
5,800 attack points!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.536
Go, Utopia Ray Victory!

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.806
Destroy Umbral Horror
Masquerade and end this duel!

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.944
Rising Sun Double
Victory Slash!

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:53.058
(screaming)

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:06.705
Yeah, all right,
gimme five!

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:07.973
You did it,
Yuma!

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.241
He really
came from behind.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.677
Yeah, took him
long enough.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:14.246
(rumbling)

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:16.515
What's going on!?

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.850
This wasteland is collapsing
in on itself!

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.953
Mizar, we
need to go!

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:21.687
Dumon!

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:22.688
Listen to me...

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:25.390
The energy from Vector
and Yuma's battle

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.660
has thrown
Sargasso out of balance.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.994
So what?

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.297
Do you want to be stuck in
this wasteland forever?

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:33.732
Next time...

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.835
You think you've won,
but you're wrong!

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.670
Mark my words!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.708
The lie that stained Astral's
heart will never go away!

00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:44.710
It'll last forever!

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.947
It'll gnaw at your bond
and destroy it!

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.070
We won,
didn't we, Astral?

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.007
Yes.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.242
But I believe our most
difficult challenge

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.211
still lies
before us, Yuma.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.118
Well I say...

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.786
Bring it on!

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:28.154
♪♪

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:31.436
