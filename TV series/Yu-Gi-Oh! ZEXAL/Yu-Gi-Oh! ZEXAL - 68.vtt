WEBVTT

00:00:00.622 --> 00:00:02.856
(Yuma)
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.156
The winner of the World Duel
Carnival is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.523
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:15.256
Vetrix, what's going on?!

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.990
The Numbers!

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.856
(Tori)
Yuma!

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.856
(Yuma)
Vetrix!

00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:34.723
(Vetrix)
I'm gonna save us!

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:37.790
Now I release all the souls
I captured!

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.490
And so goodbye, Yuma...

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.223
Astral.

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.156
Vetrix!

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.723
I'm so sorry, forgive me,
my sons.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.323
Yuma!

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:14.056
(Dr. Faker)
I've been waiting
for this moment!

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.056
(laughing)

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.290
Dr. Faker.

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:21.756
Now it's time for
the grand finale

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.856
and that grand
finale happens to be

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.623
the total destruction
of Astral World!

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.756

(laughing)

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:33.756
This is the grand finale?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.023
I was kinda hoping for a parade
and maybe some fireworks.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.223
There will
be fireworks all right

00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.123
for you are about to become
part of the energy blast

00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:44.690
fired by my
Sphere Field Cannon!

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.923
It's going to be beyond
glorious!

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:50.323
"Sphere Field Cannon?"

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:52.656
(Astral)
Yuma, look down.

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:58.823
(Yuma)
Hey, this is that garbage
facility from before.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:02:59.956
What are we doing here?

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:02.990
At this very moment,

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:05.956
this Sphere Field you're in
is being loaded into a cannon.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.090
Once it's online,

00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:10.323
the cannon will set
its sights on Astral World.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.156
Astral World?

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.423
(Astral)
These memories I have been
experiencing...

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.523
It is Astral World.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:21.023
You've helped me create
the ultimate weapon.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:23.990
This Sphere Field has gathered
all the Numbers' powers

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:26.923
into one massive
confluence of energy.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.656
Once the cannon fires
this energy,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.990
there will be
no saving Astral World.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.990
(Kite)Hart.

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:46.523
What happened to Hart?

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:48.756
Find out where he is,
Orbital Now.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.290
I'm on it.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.890
I get it now.

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:54.690
You gathering
the Numbers.

00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:56.190
It was all for this.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:59.990
Yes, as was creating
the World Duel Carnival.

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:04.223
I'll admit, I grew a bit nervous
when Kite lost to Byron.

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:08.423
But my plan became a reality
regardless of his failure.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.423
The only thing that
mattered was that the Numbers

00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:13.090
ended up gathered in one
place during the finals

00:04:13.123 --> 00:04:15.356
and that's
exactly what happened.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.756
(Yuma)
That means me, Vetrix, Kite,
Shark, Trey and his brothers.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.856
We were all just puppets
in your big master plan.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.156
Isn't that right,
Faker?

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.156
Well,
here's the thing.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.490
It's not gonna happen.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.723
What the huh?

00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.823
You cannot stop
me now.

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:38.856
It's time to shine,
Hart.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.690
The moment we've been waiting
for is almost upon us, my boy.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:44.856
Oh no-- Hart!

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:47.990
Are you sure this
is the right place?

00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.023
Positive.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.656
Signals indicate
that Master Hart

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.123
is at the bottom of
this tower, underground.

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.890
How's he doing,
is he okay?

00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:58.790
He's normal, but...
at that location,

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:01.490
Master Hart is...
Master Hart himself

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:04.423
is being used as part of
the Sphere Field Cannon.

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:07.390
Huh-- He's what?

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.556
(Yuma)
Hart, hey, Hart.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.690
Snap out of it!

00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:14.423
C'mon, Hart,
please!

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:15.890
His destiny awaits.

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:17.690
Soon, Hart will become
the trigger

00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:20.423
that will seal
Astral World's fate.

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:22.156
What is he
talking about?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.456
I see.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.056
He intends to position Hart
as an energy conduit.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.323
(Yuma)
What does that mean?

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:30.123
(Astral)
He is going to use
Hart's power

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:33.256
as a trigger to fire
the Sphere Field Cannon.

00:05:36.223 --> 00:05:38.356
(Dr. Faker)
Once Astral world
is destroyed,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.823
Barian's power
will be mine.

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:45.290
And with that, this entire
world will kneel before me.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.286
Did everyone get out okay?

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.519
(Flip)
I don't know.

00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:56.819
Hey, where's Tori?

00:05:56.853 --> 00:05:59.519
I thought she was
right behind me.

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:01.486
Do you think that she
went after Yuma?

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.986
Kari.

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:07.386
Hey, is everyone okay?

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.519
Uh, Yuma kinda disappeared
along with the duel field.

00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:12.386
And we're not sure
where Tori is.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.819
We've gotta find them.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.519
No, it's coming down.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.219
Yuma!

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:35.319
What's going on
with my deck?

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:41.053
Neo Galaxy-Eyes.

00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:43.619
This card is connected
to Hart.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:44.986
Hart's
calling out to me.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.653
(Orbital 7)
Master Kite.

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:03.519
(Dr. Faker)
Excellent.

00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.319
Keep it up, my boy.

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:08.886
(Kari)
Tori.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.353
Tori,
can you hear me?

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:12.353
Come in.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.319
(Tori)
<i>Kari?</i>

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:18.152
(Kari)
Tori, you had us worried.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:19.852
Where are you right now?

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:22.352
(Tori)
I'm at the bottom
of Heartland Tower.

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:25.486
(Kari)
<i>That thing is falling apart,
what are you doing there?</i>

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:28.019
I'm looking for Yuma,
he's gotta be here.

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:29.019
(Orbital 7)
Master Kite.

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:30.586
(Kari)
<i>Tori, get out of there.</i>

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.819
(Orbital 7)
Master Kite,
say something.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.186
Oh no, what happened?

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:38.319
<i>Uh, gotta go,
Kari, bye.</i>

00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:41.352
Wait, Tori, don't hang up,
Tori!

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:44.252
Be careful.

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:52.886
(Shark)
Yuma, where are you?

00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:02.519
C'mon, put your
motor into it.

00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:04.152
Do you want me
to overheat?

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.886
It's not budging
at all.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:10.686
(Shark)
Out of the way.

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:11.752
Where'd you come from?

00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:13.252
It's you again.

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:14.886
The robot and I can
lift that.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:18.086
As soon as we do,
you pull him outta there.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:19.286
Hello? Move!

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.652
Uh, right, okay.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:21.719
Get ready.

00:08:25.952 --> 00:08:30.652
(Orbital 7)
Master Kite, I'm so glad
you're okay.

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:31.786
Thanks, Shark.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:32.986
Don't thank me.

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:35.619
Just get him outta
here, Tori.

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:38.819
(Kite)
No, I'm not leaving.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.852
(Orbital 7)
But Master Kite...

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:43.152
(Shark)
The place is comin' down, man.

00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:45.786
I'm not leaving
without my brother.

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:46.786
What?

00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:48.852
You mean Hart
is here too?

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.152
Do you know
where he is?

00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:52.052
It's rather
complicated, actually.

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:53.519
That's enough.
It's--

00:08:53.552 --> 00:08:55.519
Where he is?

00:08:55.552 --> 00:08:56.752
Tell me where
Hart is.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.186
Out with it,
you bucket of bolts!

00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:00.986
Hart is being
used by Dr. Faker

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:04.519
to power the Sphere
Field Cannon.

00:09:04.552 --> 00:09:06.786
What is a Sphere
Field Cannon?

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:10.152
(Orbital 7)
It is the ultimate weapon
created to destroy Astral World.

00:09:10.186 --> 00:09:11.819
In order for Dr. Faker
to complete it,

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:13.786
he made Master Kite
assemble the Number Cards

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.119
so that he could gather
their energy in one place

00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:17.819
to create
a devastating blast...

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:20.052
All right, it's bad news,
we got it.

00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:22.919
So where is this thing
and how do we get to it?

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:24.652
This doesn't
concern you.

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:26.619
Let's go, Orbital.

00:09:26.652 --> 00:09:28.352
(Shark)
Where do you
think you're goin'?

00:09:30.652 --> 00:09:33.919
I don't have time to settle
a score if that's what you want.

00:09:33.952 --> 00:09:35.586
It's not.

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:37.519
All I wanna do
is save Yuma.

00:09:40.152 --> 00:09:42.152
If he's still
in the Sphere Field

00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:44.219
and they're using
it as a weapon

00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:46.386
things aren't
going to end well.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.152
(Tori)
What can we do?

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:50.619
(Shark)
I-- I don't know.

00:09:50.652 --> 00:09:52.786
All I know is that
I can't do nothing

00:09:52.819 --> 00:09:54.886
when my friend is
in trouble.

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:57.586
Now talk, ya'
lousy vacuum cleaner.

00:09:57.619 --> 00:09:58.886
The Sphere Field Cannon.

00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:00.519
How do we
get to it?

00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:02.786
I am not
a vacuum cleaner.

00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:06.219
I am a highly sophisticated
artificial intelligence unit.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:11.819
Kite, please,
I wanna help save Yuma, too.

00:10:11.852 --> 00:10:14.219
We have to
work together.

00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:18.719
Yuma was always worried about
Hart, you know that, right?

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:20.819
Please, Kite,
let's all work together

00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:23.519
and save the people
we care about.

00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:25.652
C'mon, Orbital,
let's go.

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:26.852
Understood.

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:28.319
But Kite...

00:10:28.352 --> 00:10:30.252
We're done
talking about this.

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:34.186
We need to get to the garbage
treatment facility.

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:36.752
Was that his way
of saying "follow me?"

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:39.686
I guess so?

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.886
(Yuma)
I feel so tired.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.719
I fear that
is my fault.

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:47.152
My life force
is weakening by the minute.

00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:49.719
Don't say that.

00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:51.352
Please hear me.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.119
We might be able
to save you.

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.719
But for me,
there is---

00:10:54.752 --> 00:10:55.752
Don't even say it.

00:10:55.786 --> 00:10:58.286
Nobody is leaving
anybody behind.

00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:01.052
All three of us are
getting out of here together.

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:05.819
(Orbital 7)
This is the underground
access tunnel,

00:11:05.852 --> 00:11:08.219
but it's completely blocked.

00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.219
There has to
be another way.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:11.719
Scan the building
schematics.

00:11:11.752 --> 00:11:15.186
I would, except that the access
point that would enable me

00:11:15.219 --> 00:11:16.952
to tap into the
building's engineering system

00:11:16.986 --> 00:11:18.586
has been destroyed
by debris.

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:19.786
If I can't access the--

00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:22.686
Stop making excuses,
you worthless scrap pile.

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:25.752
I don't see you doing anything
to help, you hairless ape.

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:27.119
If it weren't
for robots...

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.552
Hey, wait a sec,
maybe Kari can help.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.986
(Kari)
C'mon, almost there.

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:39.486
All right, got it.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:41.886
There's a stairwell
three blocks to the west

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:43.119
from where you guys are.

00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:44.919
You can get underground
from there.

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:47.119
Yeah, okay,
we're on it, thanks, Kari.

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:49.219
No problem,
I'm here if you need me.

00:11:49.252 --> 00:11:51.519
Don't do anything
Yuma would do.

00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:53.852
In the end,
we're all counting on you.

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:55.119
All right, follow me.

00:11:57.452 --> 00:12:00.719
(Tori)
Hang on, Yuma,
we're coming to save you.

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:09.683
(Orbital 7)
These stairs are not
good for my shocks.

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:11.283
(Shark)
Which way, tin can.

00:12:11.316 --> 00:12:12.283
(Orbital 7)
We're here.

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:14.216
Master Hart is just
up ahead.

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:18.616
(Mr. Heartland)
Welcome.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.450
I'm so glad you could find
it in you to join us.

00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:28.483
Unfortunately,
if you're looking for Hart,

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:31.850
I'm afraid he's a bit indisposed
at the moment.

00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:33.883
Where is he?

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:35.450
(Mr. Heartland)
Right here.

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:46.150
(Kite)
Hart, can you hear me?

00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:48.583
Guys, look, Yuma's
up there too.

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:50.683
(Mr. Heartland)
It was nice of you
all to drop by,

00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:53.416
but I'm afraid I have
to ask you to leave now.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.450
We have
a world to destroy.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:59.183
Litterbots, it's time
to take out the trash.

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:11.350
Orbital, get to it.

00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:12.850
I'm on it.

00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:18.516
Here I go!

00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:21.750
Sorry 'bout that.

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:23.383
My apologies.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.083
Efficient demolition skills.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.883
I'll demolish you next if
you don't keep fighting.

00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:42.116
Understood, ma'am.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:47.450
Man, there's no end
to them.

00:13:49.483 --> 00:13:51.483
I've gotta get
Hart down from there.

00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:53.616
(Mr. Heartland)
Hart's not going anywhere.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.916
Besides, I'm sure he's
happy right where he is.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.016
(Kite)
Yeah, right.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.950
He's making his
father proud.

00:13:59.983 --> 00:14:02.883
Every boy wants
to make his father proud.

00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:04.416
You, on the other hand,

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.050
are turning out to be quite
the disappointment.

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:09.016
You played your
part for a while.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.950
We certainly appreciate you
gathering Number Cards.

00:14:11.983 --> 00:14:14.616
But now you seem to have
lost your way.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.816
Your father hopes
you'll come around.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.616
But I know better.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.416
You've always been
ungrateful and arrogant,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.183
and now it's time for you

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:25.916
to vanish along with
all your little friends.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.983
Including Yuma!

00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:34.150
And now, it's time
for me to say goodbye!

00:14:41.783 --> 00:14:43.983
(Shark)
Uh-oh, this doesn't seem good.

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:50.183
(Mr. Heartland)
Below us is a portal
to Astral World.

00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:54.050
Everybody, get away from the
edge and run toward the walls.

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.716
Hart, ya gotta
fight it.

00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:58.016
Hart!

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.583
The moment I've been
waiting for is almost at hand.

00:15:02.616 --> 00:15:05.416
The cannon is almost
ready to fire.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.250
Litterbots, toss all
of this trash into the vortex.

00:15:22.516 --> 00:15:24.716
These guys just keep coming.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.050
Hey, toaster oven, can't
you do something about this?

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:29.683
I am not
a toaster oven!

00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:31.783
I am a sentient artificial
intelligence designed for--

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:33.483
Come on, keep it
together, you two.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.883
These junky Litterbots

00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:37.816
have to be receiving their
orders from somewhere, right?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.816
If we can find the source of
their signal and destroy it.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.583
(Orbital 7)
An excellent idea.

00:15:42.616 --> 00:15:46.216
I shall
investigate immediately.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.850
All orders are transmitted
from a host computer.

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:50.450
If I can somehow
hack into the host

00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:54.183
and jolt it with a large amount
of voltage... ah-ha, got it!

00:15:54.216 --> 00:15:56.216
By hooking in to that
remote access point...

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.016
Again with
the explanations.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.616
Just make it happen.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.483
How dare you speak
to me that way.

00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:03.050
I am not your minion!

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.283
I am Master Kite's--

00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:05.783
(Kite)
Would you just do it, Orbital.

00:16:05.816 --> 00:16:08.683
(Orbital 7)
Yes, Master Kite.

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:10.350
'Scuse me, outta the way,
comin' through.

00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:13.083
Up, up, and away.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.616
Commencing with full
system overload.

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.683
(Dr. Faker)
What-- What's going on?

00:16:28.516 --> 00:16:31.317
What is this?

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.717
Oh no, Orbital.

00:16:36.303 --> 00:16:37.703
Oh no, Orbital.

00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:44.737
It looks like the hunk
of junk did it.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.303
Huh-- impossible.

00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:50.570
Why is Hart's energy
decreasing?

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.403
(Mr. Heartland)
Wait a second, no, no!

00:16:57.437 --> 00:17:01.637
This isn't supposed to happen
like this... aah!

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.337
Orbital.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.103
I did wallpaper
make for--

00:17:06.137 --> 00:17:09.803
Tonight's disassemble
is brought to you by...

00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:12.237
System Error 143B.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.037
You saved us...
all of us.

00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:23.270
Huh?

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:24.670
What happened?

00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:26.637
What's goin'
on?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.070
Is that..

00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:30.403
Tori and Shark
and Kite.

00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:31.837
Why are they here?

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.570
(Astral)
The Sphere Field's energy
is weakening.

00:17:35.603 --> 00:17:38.837
This may be your
moment to escape.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.170
We must break
the Zexal bond.

00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:43.470
(Yuma)
No, We can't break the bond.

00:17:44.737 --> 00:17:46.337
(Kite)
What's going on?

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.837
Why did you do that?

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.837
Yuma, Go.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.803
You might not have
another chance to escape.

00:17:59.837 --> 00:18:01.203
Well, what about you?

00:18:01.237 --> 00:18:03.303
We're getting out
of here together.

00:18:03.337 --> 00:18:05.037
That cannot happen.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.470
I am one with
the Numbers.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:10.470
Now that the Numbers have been
gathered in this Sphere Field.

00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:12.370
I cannot leave.

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:14.470
I cannot exist
outside.

00:18:14.503 --> 00:18:16.470
What-- no way.

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:22.703
What are these?

00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:23.970
One is hope.

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:27.170
The other
is the Future.

00:18:27.203 --> 00:18:29.170
You have to go now,
Yuma.

00:18:29.203 --> 00:18:30.537
But what about you?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.170
What's gonna
happen?

00:18:32.203 --> 00:18:33.737
That does
not matter.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.570
What matters is that
you save Hart

00:18:35.603 --> 00:18:38.437
and in doing so,
you save Astral World.

00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:47.270
(Astral)
The future is in your hands.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.003
Yuma's Back.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.537
He's free.

00:19:02.603 --> 00:19:04.570
(Dr. Faker)
Did you really think
I would spend so long

00:19:04.603 --> 00:19:06.403
putting my plans into motion

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.770
and not have a backup
system in place?

00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:12.170
Once it comes online,
the cannon will repower itself.

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.970
And Astral World will
cease to exist.

00:19:15.003 --> 00:19:18.137
You will soon be finished
along with Astral World.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.137
It's over.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.570
Doctor Faker one
and Yuma zero.

00:19:22.603 --> 00:19:24.770
It's not over yet, Faker.

00:19:28.437 --> 00:19:31.203
Oh, "Hope" and "the Future ."

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:32.403
I get it.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.737
Hey, Shark
and Kite.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.570
You guys ready to rumble?

00:19:38.603 --> 00:19:40.803
As long as my friends
and I are still here

00:19:40.837 --> 00:19:43.637
we're gonna keep fighting.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.837
Do you really think
we can stop him?

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.503
(Yuma)
We have to try, Shark.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.370
C'mon, Kite,
whaddya say?

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.470
We can do
this together.

00:20:05.503 --> 00:20:06.737
This is it.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.203
There's no looking back.

00:20:12.137 --> 00:20:14.770
(Dr. Faker)
If it's a duel you want,
it's a duel you'll get.

00:20:14.803 --> 00:20:16.037
I'll demolish you

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.537
and be rid of the whole lot
of you once and for all.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.437
Your days of
meddling in my affairs

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.237
will come crashing
to an end.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.203
And after that, this
world is mine for the taking.

00:20:27.237 --> 00:20:30.170
(Tori)
C'mon guys, you can do this.

00:20:30.203 --> 00:20:32.337
You have to.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.770
After all, you're
the only hope we've got.
