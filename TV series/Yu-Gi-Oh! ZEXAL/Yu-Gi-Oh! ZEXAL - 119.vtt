WEBVTT

00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:04.246
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:07.149
Whoa! Is that
Astral World?

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.418
Quinton and Kite did it!

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:12.188
They got me here!

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:15.090
Hey!

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.425
What are you doing here, Dumon?

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.929
Reginald Kastle, your real
name is Nash and you are

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.432
one of the seven
Barian Emperors.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:25.968
Who are you?

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.304
My name is Enna.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.207
Please, share your life
force with this boy.

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:32.441
He needs you.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.442
Okay.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:34.810
Here goes.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.413
Just like this?

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:40.249
How'd I do that?

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.787
There is a spark within you that
no longer exists on this world.

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:45.688
Where'd it go?

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:49.058
Long ago the people of Astral
World saw this spark,

00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:51.727
this chaos energy as
something dangerous.

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:54.430
By purging ourselves of
this energy, we lost part

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.866
of ourselves and now our
planet is suffering.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:01.170
If our world is to have
a chance, you must free

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.707
Astral before he is erased.

00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.275
Astral!

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.410
All right!
I found you at last!

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.012
Now I 'm bustin" '
you out of here,

00:01:10.012 --> 00:01:10.879
so let's get going!

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.949
(Eliphas)
You are not
going anywhere.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.017
You're...

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:18.120
I am the Guardian
of Astral World.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.123
Those that I protect
call me Eliphas.

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.425
Well listen up,
Astral's coming with me!

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.794
No, he is not.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.295
Why?

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:27.863
Astral was born with
a twin purpose:

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:31.100
to destroy Barian World and
to guide our world towards

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.435
its destiny of
evolving its power.

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:37.439
Your chaos energy has infected
him and he has been tainted.

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.441
He is no longer pure.

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:41.110
He must be erased.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.413
Free my friend now, Eliphas,
or face the consequences!

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:48.684
I will not let Astral
leave this world.

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:50.686
Then let's duel!

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.021
Here are my terms.

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.422
Win and he goes free.

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:54.823
Lose and you do not!

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.426
Okay, fine!
You got it!

00:01:57.426 --> 00:01:58.961
Let us duel!
Let's duel!

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:03.832
I wield the power to choose
the very cards I will draw!

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:04.333
Uh-oh...

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.335
I hope this isn't
what I think it is.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:11.206

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.737
You have the power
of Shining Draw!

00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:15.437
That is right.

00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.441
Now tremble as your
defeat draws near.

00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:24.413
I activate the spell
Rank-Up Advantage!

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:28.851
And it is going to give me
a great advantage when I play

00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:30.753
this spell next!

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:33.322
Rank-Up-Magic
Astral Force!

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:36.992
Your pitiful odds of winning
this duel and leaving with

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:39.762
Astral are dropping
even lower, Yuma!

00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.732
Watch as my Etheric Anubis
ranks up by two!

00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:47.035
Oh man, it's gonna
be a Rank 6 now.

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:51.306
I overlay my Rank 4
Etheric Anubis!

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:52.708
With this one monster,

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:55.043
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:58.414
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:03:58.414 --> 00:03:59.782
Now arise!

00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:01.417
New Order 6!

00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:04.420
Etheric Apophis!

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:13.061
Having summoned an Xyz Monster
using Rank-Up-Magic,

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.199
Rank-Up Advantage's effect
activates allowing me to

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.434
draw a card from my deck!

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:22.438
With the power of Shining Draw
it will be just what I want.

00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:26.442
Then I activate Etheric
Apophis' special ability.

00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:28.410
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.648
your monster sinks
to a new low.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.420
Utopia's attack
points dropped!

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:41.423
Etheric Apophis attack Utopia!

00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:42.124
Not so fast!

00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:44.259
Utopia's special ability
stops your attack!

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.895
Wrong! Due to Rank-Up
Advantage's effect,

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:50.365
Utopia's special abilities
are all negated.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:52.935
No sweat!
Cuz I can play this...

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:53.869
Half Unbreak!

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:56.271
This trap saves Utopia
from destruction!

00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.707
And not only that, I only
take half the damage

00:04:58.707 --> 00:05:02.211
from Etheric Apophis!

00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:06.815
So be it.

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:11.320
Next time I promise you
will not be so fortunate.

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:15.791
Nash, I've come to help you.

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.126
To awaken your
true self.
What?

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:20.162
The truth about who you
and your sister are

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:22.364
has been buried deep
within your mind.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:26.435
I possess the power that can
help uncover the mystery

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:27.803
of your past.

00:05:27.803 --> 00:05:31.440
And now Nash, it's time to
learn who you really are

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.411
and take the throne as
the leader of the Barians!

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.416
This is where
I dueled Abyss, right?

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.418
That is correct my friend.

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:49.358
The visions you saw during that
duel were of your former life.

00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:53.428
It is time for you to revisit
your past so that you

00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:55.831
can unlock your future.

00:05:55.831 --> 00:06:00.802
You must do this...
for Barian World!

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.707
(Yuma)
Eliphas has me
on the ropes.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:08.443
He has an answer
for every move I make.

00:06:08.443 --> 00:06:11.413
So far he's been able to
think of a card and draw it.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.415
How am I supposed to be
able to beat that?

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.784
I see you are growing
more and more panicked as

00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:17.886
the inevitable truth sinks in.

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:21.156
There is no chance for
you to win this duel.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:24.426
The power of Shining Draw
assures me of two things:

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:29.031
that I have already won, and
that Astral's fate is sealed.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.400
Saving your friend
is impossible.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.435
The damage you
caused is irreversible.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:38.106
The seed of darkness you see is
the mark of your chaos energy.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.076
It will grow, spreading
quickly throughout his body,

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.412
fully consuming him,
leaving nothing but

00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:47.416
a shell of his former self.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.419
That can't be.

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.853
You're wrong.

00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:53.088
Astral's a fighter!

00:06:53.088 --> 00:06:56.892
He's stronger than you think,
he can beat anything!

00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:58.894
Do not fool yourself.

00:06:58.894 --> 00:07:02.998
Astral will not overcome
the darkness within him.

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:03.865
No one will.

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:05.367
You may be under the
impression that you

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:06.868
helped Enna and the others,

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:11.173
but you in fact have sentenced
them all to share Astral's fate.

00:07:11.173 --> 00:07:14.776
You see, the beings of
Astral World cannot house

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.845
the Chaos Energy within them.

00:07:16.845 --> 00:07:20.415
The power you shared is
a virus that will weaken

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:22.918
and decay them from within.

00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:24.419
That's not true!

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.287
When I first saw Enna,

00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:26.355
her friends looked
in real bad shape.

00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.057
I helped by sharing this
"Chaos Energy" with them.

00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:31.727
And now, they're totally
feelin' the flow!

00:07:31.727 --> 00:07:35.998
Ah, yes, "feeling the flow"
the words of a fool.

00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.799
Your father's words.

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:41.336
He too was blinded by chaos.

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:45.240
If you know where my dad is,
you better tell me right now!

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.441
I wish I knew of
his whereabouts,

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.746
for he must be held accountable
for his interference.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:54.082
Kazuma's meddling is what
sent Astral to your world

00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:56.918
so he would meet you.

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:00.956
Astral would never have been
tainted by your chaos energy

00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:03.692
if we had not been
betrayed by your father!

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.761
My dad wouldn't
do anything bad.

00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:07.429
He must have had a reason!

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:08.430
Regardless of the reason,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.734
we are still reeling from the
effects of his reckless actions.

00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:14.102
See for yourself.

00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:18.840
The very fact that you are
here is testament to that.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.875
Enna!

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:20.776
What are you gonna do to her?

00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:22.744
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:24.846
I cannot allow those
who have been infected

00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:26.682
by chaos to roam free.

00:08:26.682 --> 00:08:30.052
That is why I must defeat
you here and now.

00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:33.355
I cannot risk you hurting any
more of the people I am here

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.090
to serve and protect.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.427
You will fall before me!

00:08:38.427 --> 00:08:39.428
Don't be so sure!

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:41.997
You might be relying on the
power of Shining Draw to win

00:08:41.997 --> 00:08:45.367
this duel, but two can
play at that game!

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:47.135
Do not be so certain.

00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:50.272
The reason you have been able
tap into the power of Shining

00:08:50.272 --> 00:08:52.441
Draw was all due to Astral.

00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:55.906
Without him, you are nothing.

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:56.411
Oh, yeah?

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.181
Well Astral's the one who
helped me build this deck!

00:08:59.181 --> 00:09:02.050
And tapping into that deck
is in the cards for me.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.420
Because I'm so
feeling the flow!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.224
My turn! I draw!

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.027
Yes! All right!

00:09:12.027 --> 00:09:14.796
Get set to get decked Eliphas!

00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:17.432
I'm activating the spell card,

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:21.269
Rank-Up-Magic
Numeron Force!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.437
It cannot be.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:23.772
You better believe it is!

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.341
This card negates the
effects of all face up cards

00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:28.076
on the field for this turn!

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:28.777
But that's not all!

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:32.414
It also turns my Utopia
into a Chaos Xyz Monster!

00:09:32.414 --> 00:09:36.017
Utopia, what do you say we
turns things up a notch?

00:09:36.017 --> 00:09:39.421
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:43.925
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.903
I summon Chaos Number 39:
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.386
I summon Chaos Number 39:
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:22.430
I activate Utopia Ray
Victory's special ability!

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.065
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:25.801
your Etheric Apophis'
attack points

00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:28.770
are added to
Utopia Ray Victory's!

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.807
Victory Charge!

00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:40.115
How dare you bring
chaos into this duel?

00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:42.884
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:47.889
Attack with Rising Sun
Double Victory Slash!

00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:56.832
All right!

00:10:56.832 --> 00:10:58.133
Way to slice and
dice Utopia Ray!

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:02.037
I activate the trap
Ascension Spiral!

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.840
By banishing Etheric
Apophis from my graveyard,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.844
I am allowed to summon an Xyz
Monster 2 Ranks higher than

00:11:08.844 --> 00:11:12.013
the monster that was banished.

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:15.917
I summon my Rank 8 New Order...

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:18.420
Etheric Sebek!

00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:34.436
Whoa! He ranked
up again?

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:35.704
Yes, that is correct.

00:11:35.704 --> 00:11:40.141
You see, duels are fought and
won this way in Astral World.

00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.245
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Astral Force's effect

00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:44.346
from the graveyard.

00:11:44.346 --> 00:11:46.681
Instead of drawing
a card this turn,

00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.750
I can return
Astral Force to my hand.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.920
Oh no, he can use a Rank Up
Magic card against me!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.423
Yes and now I activate
Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.291
once again!

00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.428
My monster will further
evolve into greatness!

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:05.200
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.435
Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:12.741
I summon New Order 10
Etheric Horus!

00:12:19.047 --> 00:12:23.084
I activate Rank-Up
Advantage's effect!

00:12:23.084 --> 00:12:27.055
And it is sure to squash
the last remnants of hope

00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:27.422
in your heart.

00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:31.960
Since I summoned an Xyz Monster
using Rank-Up-Magic, I draw one

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.329
card and with the might
of Shining Draw,

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:37.799
I drew the very card
I need a second Astral Force!

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.434
Oh, no, come on,
not another one!

00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:44.439
I activate Astral Force to bring
out the epitome of perfection!

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:49.344
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:12:49.344 --> 00:12:52.013
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:12:52.013 --> 00:12:57.385
I summon, New Order 12
Etheric Mahees!

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:11.299
Whoa, this guy doesn't quit!

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:14.169
He keeps powering
up his monsters!

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:18.039
Rank-Up Advantage
lets me draw a card!

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:20.241
Victory will soon be mine.

00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:24.279
Because when I activate Etheric
Maahes' special ability,

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:28.116
all its Overlay Units
revert back into monsters,

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:31.052
creating an unstoppable army!

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:36.891
So come back to the field,
Etheric Sebek and Horus!

00:13:43.932 --> 00:13:45.834
He has three Xyz monsters!

00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:48.770
Could this possibly
get any worse?

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.438
The answer is yes.

00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:53.441
I activate Rank Domination!

00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:56.311
Now only Xyz Monsters
can attack,

00:13:56.311 --> 00:14:01.683
starting with the monster
with the lowest Rank.

00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:06.855
Behold your target, my Sebek!

00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:09.157
Attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:14:09.157 --> 00:14:13.228
I activate Utopia Ray
Victory's special ability!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.130
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:20.402
it gains attack points equal
to Sebek's attack points.

00:14:21.136 --> 00:14:25.440
Then I will counter your move
with Rank Domination's effect!

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.076
When our monsters battle,
the one with the lower Rank

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.913
loses attack points equal to
the difference in their Ranks,

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.948
multiplied by 1,000.

00:14:33.948 --> 00:14:36.918
Your Utopia Ray Victory
is Rank 5.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:40.722
My Sebek is Rank 8,
so the difference is 3.

00:14:40.722 --> 00:14:45.693
Utopia Ray Victory's loses
3,000 attack points!

00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:47.162
And now, go Sebek!

00:14:47.162 --> 00:14:51.666
Sink your teeth into
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:14:53.802 --> 00:14:55.804
You'll never destroy it!

00:14:55.804 --> 00:14:58.440
Only a Number can
destroy a Number!

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.410
That may be true but you will
soon learn in this duel,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.746
Numbers are quite powerless.

00:15:04.746 --> 00:15:05.914
Say what?

00:15:05.914 --> 00:15:10.085
Etheric Horus
prepare to strike!

00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:14.956
Rank Domination's effect now
activates, reducing your

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:20.695
Utopia Ray Victory's
attack points by 5,000!

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.433
Uh-oh!

00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:28.436
The stage has been
set Etheric Horus!

00:15:28.436 --> 00:15:32.140
Attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.418
Barian World?
Yes.

00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:45.653
It is unclear how you and Marin

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:48.056
got from our home
to this world,

00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.657
but that does not matter.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:53.761
What is important is for you
to fully realize everything

00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:56.965
about your true self.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.413
(Shark) I'm back.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.086
Do not fret my brother.

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:22.390
I will offer up my
own soul to Abyss.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.826
No!

00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:30.031
Rio!

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:42.143
Abyss Splash was
the key to my victory!

00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:44.879
Now we must regroup!

00:16:47.182 --> 00:16:51.419
(Rio)
Now our people
will be unharmed.

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:52.720
Rio...

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.089
Rio...

00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:56.090
My friend...

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.426
I am so sorry.

00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:00.929
Rio...

00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:03.665
Rio!

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:11.072
Vector! Vengeance
will be mine!

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:15.710
I will not rest until you and
your armies fall before me.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.711
This I promise!

00:17:16.711 --> 00:17:21.082
I will get payback
for my sister!

00:17:28.022 --> 00:17:31.793
Prepare to strike!
Show no mercy!

00:17:40.702 --> 00:17:43.037
Lay waste to everything!

00:17:43.037 --> 00:17:46.841
Forward! Victory
is ours!

00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:02.423
After him! He must
not escape!

00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:06.928
Vector! I will
hunt you down!

00:18:09.998 --> 00:18:11.432
He was here.

00:18:11.666 --> 00:18:13.034
Sadly, yes.

00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:15.370
Vector knows no mercy.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.139
He will not stop
his destructive ways.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.776
We must put a stop to him.

00:18:28.016 --> 00:18:30.418
Rio...

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:35.423
I may be banged-up,
but I'm not beaten!

00:18:35.423 --> 00:18:36.424
Not yet.

00:18:36.424 --> 00:18:38.993
But that time draws near.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.094
Sorry, no chance!

00:18:40.094 --> 00:18:43.164
I'm gonna win this duel
and rescue Astral!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.232
You will not succeed.

00:18:44.232 --> 00:18:48.136
And your friend will very
soon vanish from existence.

00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:50.438
Then he will be reborn.

00:18:50.438 --> 00:18:51.939
What does that mean?

00:18:51.939 --> 00:18:53.941
The Astral you know
will be no more.

00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:56.678
His memories of you
will no longer exist.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.112
All he will know is his mission

00:18:58.112 --> 00:19:00.081
to destroy Barian World.

00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:02.917
That can't be!

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:06.721
He'd never forget
our times together!

00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:08.756
I won't let you
take that away!

00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:12.093
Try as you might, victory
will not be yours.

00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:14.929
The end is here!

00:19:14.929 --> 00:19:17.899
Now go, Etheric Maahes!

00:19:17.899 --> 00:19:21.903
Attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:19:22.303 --> 00:19:24.806
Rank Domination's
effect activates!

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:27.909
Since the Rank difference
between Utopia Ray Victory

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:29.711
and Etheric Maahes is seven...

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:35.216
Utopia Ray Victory loses
7,000 attack points!

00:19:36.017 --> 00:19:37.218
Zero attack points!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.153
What am I gonna do now?

00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:40.722
That is quite simple.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:44.726
What you will do is
lose this duel!

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.667
This can't be it!
Can it?

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:56.437
No! Astral!

00:19:58.873 --> 00:19:59.440
Oh, no!

00:19:59.674 --> 00:20:01.909
Yuma's in trouble!

00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:10.097
