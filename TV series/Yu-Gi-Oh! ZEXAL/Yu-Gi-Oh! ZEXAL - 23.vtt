WEBVTT

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.790
Yuma: Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.460
KITE: Get it in gear, orbital 7!

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.460
We're going
number hunting again.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.290
Dr. Faker says there was an
original visitor who brought the

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.260
numbers to this planet.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.090
I suspect, this mysterious
Visitor may have found a host in

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.830
heartland city.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.690
Orbital 7: Remember that boy
yuma you challenged?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.230
He was wearing
a strange pendant.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.890
The pendant did not
come from this planet.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.930
Really?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.430
Orbital!

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.360
Locate Yuma and gather as much
information on him as you can.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.390
Now which locker is yuma's?

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.990
Target identified.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.260
Finders, keepers!

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.360
SHARK: This doesn't
belong to you.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.460
Why don't you do yourself a
favor and hand that pendant over

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.590
to me right now!?

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.690
not a chance.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.590
This thing isn't yours pal!

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.990
Let's duel!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.090
I xyz summon, number 30:
Acid golem of destruction!

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.990
I activate splash capture!

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.430
Number Hunter, I now
control your acid golem

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.460
and all of its power!

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.260
Go photon stream of destruction!

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.930
It's impossible!

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.260
Galaxy-Eyes isn't a number card.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.690
Only a number can
destroy a number.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.960
Wrong again.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.330
Once acid golem loses its
overlay Units, that

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.460
rule no longer applies.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.490
You've already lost.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.730
How's that?

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.960
Because you're still
under acid golem's curse.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.860
I'll take that number now.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.490
Along with
your soul as well.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.690
Shark!

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.160
Hello, yuma.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.090
Hey, leave that
alone - It's mine!

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.760
Oh No, he's got astral!

shark!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360
C'mon!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.430
Wake up!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.660
Can you hear me?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.230
Please, you gotta
snap out of it!

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.890
BRONK: Oh man, this looks bad

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.960
are you finished yet?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960
Almost.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.530
The analysis is still running.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.390
I just have to complete this
photon stream probe.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.360
If this works, it could help us
figure out if this pendant

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.130
really does come from another
World, and just maybe what its

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.890
real purpose is.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.130
Find out everything you can.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.730
Dr. Faker is keeping
something from me.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.860
But I'm going to
uncover the truth.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.160
If dr. Faker hears
about this investigation,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.590
he'll go ballistic.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.760
So will I if you
don't get results.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.330
You can count on me!

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.590
Is Shark gonna be okay?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.730
Caswell: The doctor says there's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.560
nothing wrong
with him physically.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.290
Cathy: Why doesn't
he wake up then?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.560
Because

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.690
shark's soul has been stolen.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.160
Please, this is no
time for jokes.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.690
I think he means it.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.090
Don't ya yuma?

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.290
Unfortunately Yeah Caswell.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.960
When that number Hunter Kite
wins a duel, he takes the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.030
loser's number and their soul.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.430
He stole something
else this time, too.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.490
My golden key.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.990
And astral was inside it when
Kite took it and flew off.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.060
I have to get it back!

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.090
He lives in there?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.290
Yeah.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.090
I can't explain how it
works, but it's True.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.690
As long as that key is with
me, astral is with me too.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.660
In the end, I'm afraid your key
won't be easy to recover,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.030
Especially if you don't know
where Kite has gone.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.190
We'll help you find it yuma!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.030
Sure, but how?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.390
If that key really is special,
Kite will want to examine it.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.560
He'll most likely want to run
some kind of computer analysis

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.990
yuma!

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.690
I think I've just figured out a
way to track down your key!

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.130
Well I'll be rebooted!

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.390
What is it?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.530
The pendant has its own
gravitational field inside!

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.590
Its own field?

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.630
Is that possible?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.030
Look!

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.960
The field is generating an
inter-Dimensional Link between

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.190
this world And, somewhere else.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.430
It must be astral world.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.330
Open that Link now, orbital.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Okey-Doke!

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.160
Mr. Kay: You want me to
track down a Crook?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.260
We're counting on you Mr. Kay!

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.290
All you have to do is upload a
virus into the datanet and find

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.960
the computer he's using.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.530
I don't know.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.790
After all I'm a teacher
not a detective.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.830
There's no way we can fail with
your programming skills!

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.190
But even so

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.290
but nothing Mr. Kay

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.530
the only way to save shark and
astral is if you help us!

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.060
May I have a word in private?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.290
Listen.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.260
I know you want to help.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.690
Especially after all
the trouble you caused with

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.460
your crashbug virus.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.660
Crashbug!

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.360
I bet you feel pretty
bad about all the chaos

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.730
you caused around the city!

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.960
Not so loud, huh?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.390
But now's your chance to make up
for it by helping us out!

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.830
Alright

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.930
he's going to help!

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.430
Excellent!

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.930
You sure we should be hacking
into the datanet with a virus?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.330
Sounds kind of risky.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.530
Relax, bronk!

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.360
I promise this virus
is totally harmless.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.730
It will simply track All datanet
searches relating to yuma's key

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.890
and then pinpoint
where they came from.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.560
Which should lead us
directly to Kite's computer,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.060
and to yuma's key!

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.890
All thanks to
Mr. Kay's expertise!

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.930
Crashbug!

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.830
Hey, am I wrong or does Mr.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.730
Kay's expertise look an awful
lot like the crashbug virus?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.390
You mean the virus that made
the city grid go haywire

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.530
I'm sure Mr. Kay had
nothing to do with that!

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.460
Did you?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.560
You kids and your wild
imaginations!

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.690
Yes!

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.890
The virus has been
uploaded successfully!

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.990
Fingers Crossed everyone!

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.990
Crashbug!

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.890
Crashbug!

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.690
Now go find my key!

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.790
Carbonic Laser, negative,
hydrophonic beam, thumb's down

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.930
nothing is working, master Kite!

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.360
I've tried every energy
source on this planet and

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.790
there's no response.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.490
Then use a baria crystal.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.490
Really?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.990
You heard me.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.660
It comes from the barian
World, not from this planet.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.090
Its energy may
activate the pendant.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.360
Great idea, but baria
crystals are rare.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.760
I'm afraid finding one
won't be easy.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.290
Use your crystal.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.130
But that's my energy source!

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.760
I can't function without it!

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.690
Losing One small shard
shouldn't be a problem.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.430
I guess not.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.530
Here goes Nothing except my
power Supply, that is.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.030
This baria crystal
lights up my life!

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.090
I hate to give up any
of it, but I suppose losing

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.490
a tiny bit won't hurt, much.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.930
Okay.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.190
Now I'll move the baria
crystal so its energy

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.660
field converges with the pendant

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.190
master Kite!

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.630
It's working!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.660
The pendant is reacting to the
crystal's energy field!

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.860
I can't be sure, but it
appears that the pendant's

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.460
internal gravity is warping, the
readings are quite unusual.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.430
Sir - Look!

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.230
Do you realize what
this is, orbital?

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.760
Yuma's pendant has opened up a
portal, and I bet it's a portal

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.190
to astral world!

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.530
Master?

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.190
I wish he'd learn to
look before he leaps.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.030
Could this be astral world?

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.730
What is that?

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.030
The virus is still
searching for Kite's computer.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.790
Come on find it!

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.660
Crashbug!

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.330
Crashbug!

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.130
The virus has detected
something, we're in luck!

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.390
The data-Stream leads to a
warehouse that's owned by

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.360
Mr.Heartland

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.560
that's where my golden key is!

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.190
TORI: Yuma!

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.560
We meet at last.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.260
You must be the visitor
from, astral world.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.360
Astral: I should have guessed it
was you, Kite.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.830
How do you know my name?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.330
We were opponents
in a duel once.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.960
Oh really?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.860
That number card

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.430
it's hard for me to imagine why
you'd want to team up with a

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.630
twerp like yuma tsukumo.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.460
At least he is no thief.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.590
Are you not the one who
stole the golden key?

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.890
So that's what the
pendant is called

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.060
you also hunt numbers.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.060
Why?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.230
Why do you?

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.860
Because, numbers are fragments
of my memories.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.490
So, you need them to remember?

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.630
That is right.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.460
Now please tell me
why you want numbers.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.160
I demand you answer me.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.490
I want to learn
the numbers' secrets.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.430
And the secrets of
astral world And barian world.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.960
Barian?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.990
The only way to make sure I get
the answers I need is to seize

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.730
all the numbers.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.160
So I'm going to need you to hand
over the numbers you've

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.890
collected with yuma!

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.590
If I did that, I would never
regain my memories.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.290
Then I'll have to
get them another way.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.630
How about a duel?

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.360
I gotta get to that warehouse
before it's too late!

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.960
Photon Transformation go!

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.760
Hope you're good at
subtraction 'cause your about

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.130
to lose your number

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.830
if I lose this duel, I will lose
more than just my numbers.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.860
But I cannot avoid
this challenge.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.860
Ready!

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.290
Let's duel!

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.690
Yuma

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.230
Why're your cards
getting all glowy?

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.190
I think astral's using them!

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.060
Since you challenged me,
I will draw first!

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.590
I play a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.490
Then I'll place another card
facedown and end my turn.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.090
By placing gogogo golem in
defense mode, it can avoid being

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.030
destroyed by an
attack once per turn.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.390
And then by placing my battle
break trap card, I have further

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.360
fortified my defenses.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.230
Now when Kite attacks, this trap
will activate, destroying his

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.830
monster and ending
the battle immediately.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.130
Go ahead and make
your move, Kite.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.730
I am ready for you!

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.360
Brace yourself.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.290
Here I go!

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.990
I'll start by pinning your
facedown card in place.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.230
Lock it down reverse Buster!

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.160
When Reverse Buster
attacks, you can't activate

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.190
your spell and trap cards!

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.560
Now, reverse Buster, take out
his facedown monster!!

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.790
your gogogo
golem is a goner!

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.130
Cause I'm activating reverse
Buster's special ability!

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.660
What!?

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.490
when reverse Buster attacks a
facedown monster in defense

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.590
mode, your monster is
automatically destroyed!

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.630
And since reverse Buster's
special ability destroyed your

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.430
monster, you might want to say
your last good-Byes because your

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.560
gogogo golem can't be saved

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.290
and it gets better, because when
reverse Buster destroys a

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.890
monster that way,
it gets stronger!

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.390
2000 attack Points

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.630
If Kite uses another monster
with at least 2000 attack

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.730
points, he can tribute
them to summon galaxy

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.530
eyes photon Dragon.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.690
Is that his
strategy or does he have

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.390
another plan for his monster?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.190
Kite is a clever duelist.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.890
I must be careful or
I will lose everything!

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.360
I end my turn with a facedown!

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.190
I must commend you.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.890
It seems your dueling skills
are even more masterful

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.590
than I remember, Kite.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.890
How flattering.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.930
But if you're trying
to trick me into lowering

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.660
my guard, forget it.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.090
I meant what I said.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.190
It is clear that you are the
best duelist I have ever met.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.290
Yet I cannot shake
This feeling that you are not

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.560
doing this for yourself.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.090
Why is that, Kite?

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.390
Wait.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.160
Is this a duel or are we
playing twenty questions now?

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.030
I understand why you're trying
to stall as long as possible

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.330
though, since you're losing.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.690
I sense you are hiding
something, something that

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.960
troubles you deeply.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.160
Enough talking!

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.460
Let's get this duel over with!

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.830
Of course.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.530
I do wish We were not meeting
as opponents, however.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.130
I find you fascinating.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.790
I think you are
very much like yuma.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.490
Like yuma?

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.360
Although I was unable to become
one with him, my time with Yuma

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.630
has helped me understand and
appreciate his spirit.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.430
He misses his parents very much.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.360
This longing in
yuma's heart drives him to

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.790
follow their example.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.030
That is why he is always trying
to "high five the sky."

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.760
Yuma never gives up.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.130
And you, think that
I'm like him.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.790
Correct.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.030
You're wrong!

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.790
Just one person
matters to me.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.390
I only care about Hart!

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.430
Who is Hart?

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.830
Never mind!

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.130
Let's get back to what's
important - Dueling!

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.560
Get on with your turn!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.930
Alright, I draw!

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.860
I now play Gogogo giant!

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.490
This monster can bring back
gogogo golem from my graveyard

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.930
in defense mode.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.230
And since it used its special
ability, gogogo giant now has to

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.560
switch to defense mode as well.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.690
Two level four
monsters on the field.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.530
Interesting

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.660
he must be getting
ready to summon a number!

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.230
Without knowing the identity of
Kite's facedown card I am not

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.790
sure if I should
risk Summoning my number or

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.330
strengthen my defenses?

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.330
Since I now have two monsters in
defense mode I can activate the

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.560
spell double defender!

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.530
Now Once per turn I can negate
an attack from your monster.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:23.930
Finally I will end my turn by
placing one card facedown.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.460
I must admit I'm surprised.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.930
I thought you'd summon utopia.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.360
But then you'd be taking a big
risk, wouldn't you, because

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.360
you'd lose the two monsters
that are defending you.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.360
And doing that would leave you
quite vulnerable.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.360
Those two facedown cards you
played - They're there to

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.660
protect you aren't they?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.430
You seem very
worried about something.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.260
Are you scared that I'll summon
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon?

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.230
You are scared!

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.590
As you should be!

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.530
I now play the spell
card photon hurricane!

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.890
Brace Yourself, because all the
trap and spell cards on your

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.430
field are about
to be blown away!

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.490
Hope you weren't
counting on those facedown

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.730
cards to save you!

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.560
It cannot be!

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.460
Yes, the facedown card
that made you panic so much

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.390
was nothing I
should have feared.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.560
If only you'd had the
guts to be more aggressive

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.060
on your last turn

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.790
I would have been
in real trouble.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.830
You're going to pay a price
for being so cautious!

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:31.030
Now I'm tributing reverse Buster
in order to summon photon Leo!

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.630
I activate its special ability!

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.290
Howling blow!

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.760
The end is near, because my
photon Leo's ability blows all

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.130
the cards in your hand back into
your deck and forces you to draw

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.030
the same number of cards again.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.530
Why don't you stop your
stalling and get drawing!

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.460
I'm afraid you'll
have to totally rethink

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.690
your strategy now.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.890
Or you could just give up.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.860
It's clear you don't have what
it takes to win this duel.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.060
You're too scared of losing.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.330
Move it, you guys!

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.290
Hello

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.430
Open up!

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.990
I know you're in there, Kite!

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.230
Yuma!

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.490
Look at your deck.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.160
Astral's still dueling.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.730
I have to get in and help him!

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.030
What're you so worried about?

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.260
I'm worried cause
he's dueling Kite.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.660
And he can't win alone!

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.560
So who's this dude Kite again?

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.160
He's a number Hunter, bronk.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.230
Gotta hurry!

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.260
Hey!

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.130
Hey Kite lemme in!

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.930
Now I'll make photon Leo even
stronger with the equip spell

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.590
photon, Spear!

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.730
Now when photon Leo attacks your
monster in defense mode, if my

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.790
monster is stronger than yours,
the point difference is dealt to

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.690
you as damage!

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.860
Photon Leo, stick
it to gogogo giant!

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.030
Silver Spear strike!

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.060
Kite was correct.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.030
I have been so anxious about
losing this duel, that I focused

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.430
all my attention on not losing.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.990
I never gave serious
thought to how to win.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.360
C'mon, open!

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.130
It won't budge

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.360
give us a hand you guys!

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.730
All together!

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.830
Wow, I guess we're
stronger than I thought.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.430
I uploaded a new virus to crash
the warehouse security system.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.160
You should be all clear now.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.090
Thanks Mr. Kay, you rock!

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.730
Now Let's move in!

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.460
Hello Master Kite!

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.160
Can you hear me?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.890
I hope he's okay

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.790
because there's no
way I'm leaping into that

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.030
thing to rescue him!

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.830
Crashbug!

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.790
What's this?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.130
Uh-Oh we're being hacked!

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.630
I had better update my
anti-Virus software!

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.390
It's too late!

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.560
The whole system is crashing!

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.760
Master Kite will not be pleased.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.130
Announcement: security breach in
sector three.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.230
security breach in sector three

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.860
it's yuma, how did they
get in here!?

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.960
I'm going to need a
lot of new parts AFTER

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.890
Kite Hears about this.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.230
You know you're going to lose.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.490
Why don't you
accept the inevitable?

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.530
Call it quits and give
me all your numbers.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.730
No, I will not quit.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.030
While you were sounding off I
remembered some Very wise advice

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.830
I once heard from
a friend of mine.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:29.090
Prepare yourself number Hunter
because I am feeling the flow!
