Astral: This gear
puzzle seems to move

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.290
every time I recover
one of the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.860
99 missing number
cards. But why?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.560
Could it have something to
do with my memory loss?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.060
Could solving this puzzle

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.730
also solve my amnesia?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.960
And what does yuma have
to do with it all?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.760
Why is this apparatus
inside his key?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.160
YUMA: Aw, nuts!

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.130
I hate running late
at a cross walk!

hey!

Red Means...

shark!

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.530
wonder what he's been up
to since our last duel?

[engine revving]

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.960
Well, guess he's
not stopping.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.130

Caswell: 'fraid not.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.530
You're late yuma,
big time.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
I am not!

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.990
Hmm, you are.
Quite.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.360
Late how?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.230
Late in explaining
what's up with Those

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.160
number cards you play with.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130
If you mean why they're
not in my deck right now,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.390
that's a no-Brainer.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.960
It is?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.060
TORI: It is!

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.330
They're only here
when astral is here.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.360
And Who is astral?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.790
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.360
In the end, it's clear why
you're hiding them away.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.990
Because they're your
secret weapon,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.890
what let's you win
all the time.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.860
Hey, that's not
True at all.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.590
Sure I have some good
cards but the reason

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.290
I win my matches is
because I'm a good duelist!

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.890
Yeah, sure it is.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.290
Come on...

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.530
you could never have beaten
shark or flip without 'em,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.990
tell me I'm wrong.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.030
Hello!

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.060
I told ya you were wrong,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.390
but if ya want me
to tell ya again,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.530
no problem. You are wrong,
wrong, wrong-Wrong-Wrong-Wrong!

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.490
Wow, six wrongs!

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.460
BRONK: I'd have gone
seven just to be sure.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.190
Yeah. Plus seven is a lucky
number so there's that.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.190
Look, you can say 'wrong' a
hundred times, but I think

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.830
we both know there's just
one way to settle this.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.460
A duel!

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.630
You got it.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.230
I'll take on anyone you
want and beat 'em

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.790
without using a single
one of my number cards.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.190
Yuma...

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.460
Oh boy.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.590
Really?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.460
Even if the individual
I want you to take on

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.090
is your old foe, shark?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.230
No prob!

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.190
Let's go find him
and get dueling!

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.660
Wait hold on, yuma.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.730
You might want to think
twice about looking for him.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.790
After you beat shark,
he really changed.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.590
Started hanging with a
bunch of roughneck dudes!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.960
If you decide to do this
and challenge him,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.850
you could be in for the
duel of your life!

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.530
ANNOUNCER: Welcome and
Please enjoy your

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.660
shopping experience
with us today.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.490
Why can't anyone understand?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.290
It's the duelist that makes the
cards, not the other way around.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.830
I understand yuma,
if that helps.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.360
No, it doesn't help.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.590
And do you know why?

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.260
Cause it's your fault that I'm
even in this great big mess,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.460
astral!

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.760
My fault? How?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
Cause you're always hovering
around, interfering.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.030
Untrue!

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.660
When you sleep, I no
longer hover above you.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.730
More for my benefit, snorer.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.330
Yeah, well you don't exactly
stay clear during my duels

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.930
now, do ya?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.190
Until now.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.630
This time astral, I
don't want you helping.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.430
Wait up!

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.790
Yuma...

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.460
where on earth are you going?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.860
To go duel shark.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.990
This is where I heard
he's been hanging.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.660
Way creepy.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.460
What do you say we just grab
some corndogs instead?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.830
Seriously.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.330
It's my treat!

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.660
Wait! Yuma...

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.060
What is this place?

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.430
I am getting strange vibes.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.890
We're coming too!

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.260
Tori, no.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.030
This place is creepy.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.690
Hey, you hear that?

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.090
What in the world?

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.260
Get off of me!

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.630
Let go!

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.060
SCORCH: What are you little
pipsqueaks doing here?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.490
Don't ya know This
is our territory?

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.090
Hey, let bronk
go! Ahh!

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.160
Yuma!

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.630
Let me go!

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.760
You're gonna be sorry!

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.030
CHILLS: I wouldn't
bet on that.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.360
Weasel: Well what
do we got here?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.030
If you're looking
for trouble,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.290
it's found.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.390
Hey!

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.560
Just leave us alone!

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.430
Or else you're gonna have to
deal with me when I get down!

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.290
That Strategy is not sound.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.790
These thugs do not
look like they will be

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.160
putting anyone
down anytime soon.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.730
Stay outta this, astral!

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.960
Hey Scorch,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.160
what's the next move?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.760
Teach' em a lesson!

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.630
SHARK: Stop.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.060
Let go of the little brats.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.230
Shark...

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.130
what, you know 'em
or somethin

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.630
sure do.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.360
Guess it's your lucky day.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.190
Huh?

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.490
You shouldn't have come here.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.530
I came here,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.260
cause I have business
with you, shark!

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.760
What business?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.890
The business of
duelin', that's what!

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.830
I can't duel you.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.960
How come?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.030
Because I quit dueling.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.660
I moved on, yuma.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.930
And now I'm moving on from you.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.530
What do they say about sharks?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.260
That they can't change
their stripes?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.760
No bronk, that's zebras.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.890
Whatever.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.660
Point is, seems like
shark's sure changed his.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.830
So yuma,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.230
what's your take on all this?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.530
After observing you,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.560
I think I know what
you are going to say.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.060
Good riddance to
that bullying pest.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.290
Am I correct, yuma?

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.590
Maybe.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.760
I don't know.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.330
But then again maybe not.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.830
What exactly are you
talkin' about, yuma?

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.660
I guess it's just always a
shame when any duelist quits.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.460
Yeah, I guess that you're
kinda right about that.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.730
You're supposed to
duel for life,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.630
not just give it up.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.790
This shark stuff's
got me down, astral.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.690
I gotta help him feel
the flow again.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.990
Cause if I don't, he might
call it quits forever.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.230
Hey Tori,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.490
where's yuma?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.630
I don't know, he's
not here though.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.830
I was afraid of this.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.990
What do you want?

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.490
You know what I
want? A duel!

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.160
Question is, why
don't you want one?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.590
What happened to you?

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.860
You wouldn't understand.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.490
Yeah I would. I get frustrated
with dueling all the time!

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.290
Trust me.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.590
Come on, shark.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.830
Let's just duel!

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.230
For the last time, yuma.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.330
I have quit!

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.390
Shark, wait!

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.890
Okay, time to
high-Five the sky...

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.930
ahh!

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.160
You can't lose me!

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.130
I finally lost him.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.790
Shark!

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.390
You're not losing anything,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.790
except the duel
we're about to have!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.660
What do you say?

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.530
Aw come on, I thought
we were friends!

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.590
We are not friends,
you got that?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.260
Why would you even
think that anyway?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.760
Why would I think
we're friends?

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.290
Because we dueled!

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.030
And as your friend I'm gonna be
the one to tell ya that it's

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.290
time you dump those thugs
you've been hanging out with.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.960
It's none of your business
who I hang out with, yuma.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.360
Oh yeah?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.830
I'll make it my business.
I beat you, and you ditch them!

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:31.890
Yeah?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.130
And what do I get
if I beat you?

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.060
Well then you...
you get to have this.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.860
No yuma,
wait.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.760
You keep quiet.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.160
Okay.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.890
You got yourself a deal.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.360
And once This is all over,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.490
I'm gonna get that
necklace of yours.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.430
Yuma, are you
sure about this?

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.590
I told you, astral.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.060
I don't want your help
during this duel.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.060
And that goes for all of
those number cards as well.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.330
What do you mean?

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.290
I mean it's time that I prove
that it's the duelist that makes

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.530
the cards, not the
other way around.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.430
Oh yuma...

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.690
besides, it's not fair
to use number cards

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.390
against shark,
he doesn't have any.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.430
And Hey, now I've even
got a noble cause

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.130
that I'm dueling for.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.090
Shark shouldn't be hanging
with those jerks,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.590
and soon he won't be!

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.760
Alright then.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.330
Consider me a spectator.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.590
i haven't forgotten
our last duel, yuma.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.130
if I'm gonna come
out of retirement,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.190
i can think of No better reason
than to do it to beat you!

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.730
Game time!

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.560
Duel Disk go!

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.330
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.190
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.600
Together: Let's do this!

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.990
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.730
Alright, I am feelin'
the flow!

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.130
I summon gogogo golem!

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.660
Be careful, yuma.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.160
Shark has a trove
of powerful beasts.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.490
That golem is tough but...

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.190
zip it, astral!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.090
Next I place one
card face down,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.630
and since I can't attack on the
first move of the game,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.860
I end my turn.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.660
the card I placed
face down is battle break.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.360
now if shark attacks,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.730
my trap Will destroy his
attacking monster

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.190
and end the battle.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.790
that'll show Everyone
my dueling skills.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.090
My turn!

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.690
I draw!

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.330
I summon friller shark!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.360
But it only has
700 attack points.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.560
What could shark be planning?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.790
Now I summon shark stickers!

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.090
You see yuma, when friller
shark is on the field,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.690
shark stickers Can be
summoned right from my hand.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.990
And I think I know
what's coming next.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.530
Uh-Oh...

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.030
now I overlay level 3 friller
shark and shark stickers!

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.030
With These two monsters,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.090
I can build an overlay
network and xyz summon!

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.290
Now, say hello
to aero shark!

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.830
1900 attack points?

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.560
That's a hundred
more than my golem.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.060
But still, not more than
my trap card Can handle!

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.930
Now I'll play
aero Shark's ability!

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.960
By Using up one overlay unit,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.460
you take 400 points of damage
for every card in my hand!

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.630
And since I have
four cards in my hand,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.130
that adds up to 1600
points of damage, yuma.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.430
Oh no!

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.730
Next I activate the spell
mystical space typhoon

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.090
from my hand!

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.260
Thanks to typhoon,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.760
I can blow off one spell
or trap card on the field!

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.860
Aw No, not my trap card.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.660
Now go, aero shark!

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.330
Attack gogogo golem
with Devouring dive!

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:45.860
I place one card face down,
and end my move.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.990
Unbelievable!

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.590
Yuma is down to 2300 life
Points after just one turn!

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.060
Shark duels pretty
well for a retiree.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.630
No joke.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.790
Well, yuma?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.160
I hope that you're
happy with yourself.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.460
You wanted a duel with
me, and you got one.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.630
And all the hurt
that comes with it!

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.090
Get real!

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.990
I'm not feelin'
hurt at all!

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.660
well, maybe I'm
feelin' a little,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.760
but no point
in Sharin' that.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.290
i gotta do something,
and fast!

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.990
My draw!

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.430
Time to make a move,

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.890
now!

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.160
Alright!

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.490
I summon gagaga magician!

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.360
And the magic of gagaga is that
once per turn it can change it's

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.490
level to a number
between 1 and 8.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.760
that's nothing compared to what

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.560
i have up my sleeve,
or in my hand rather.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.530
monster reborn.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.960
if I use this to resurrect
gogogo golem,

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.660
i can bring utopia
to the field!

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.530
hold up, utopia is
a number card.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.730
i said I wasn't using those
this duel. Aw, nuts!

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.160
Go on!

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.560
Play That number!

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.560
I want you to!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.330
Has Shark lost his mind?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.430
Yeah, only a number can
destroy a number,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.030
and shark doesn't have one!

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.230
So Why would he want
yuma to play it?

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.360
Well?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.790
We're waiting, yuma.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:08.230
You know playing it is the only
way you'll be able to beat me!

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.460
But then again Maybe your
number's not enough,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.190
maybe the only reason I
agreed to duel you

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.430
was to prove I could
take it down!

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.960
okay, now I'm
really confused.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.830
i wanted to duel shark to prove
i could beat him without Using

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.160
a number card, but he
wants to duel me

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.760
to prove he can beat me
with a number card.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.090
Yuma,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.230
if the duelist really
makes the card,

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.630
Yeah...

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.590
then it should not matter
if that card in question

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.530
happens to be weak
or to be strong.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.530
And besides all of that,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.290
what you have really set
out to accomplish here

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.060
is not to help out
your ego as a duelist,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.390
but to help
your friend, shark.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.460
Oh Yeah,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.530
I almost forgot.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.990
I gotta get him to lose
those loser friends of his.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.290
And to make that happen,
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.690
I activate the spell
card monster reborn!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.190
And now bring back gogogo
golem from my graveyard.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.390
Next I overlay level 4 gagaga
magician and gogogo golem.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.260
Alright!

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.390
With These two monsters,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.330
an overlay network has been
built and that means,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.290
I can xyz summon!

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.160
So appear, number 39: Utopia!

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.360
Yuma just played
a number card?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.830
Yeah, what gives?

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.890
I thought he was done
with those digits.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.790
It's like I said, yuma needs
number cards to win.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.690
I knew I was right.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.930
Yes yuma,
do it.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.070
Attack me!

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.990
Yes Yuma,
do it.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.660
Attack me with your
number monster!

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.160
Alright,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.630
go, utopia!

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.290
Take out aero shark!

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.560
I'm not afraid!

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.230
I play friller
Shark's ability!

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.030
By Banishing the friller shark
in my graveyard from play, your

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.660
utopia's attack is stopped, and
it loses 500 attack points!

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.960
No!

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.730
Next I play
fish rain!

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.730
Thanks to this trap card, when a
fish type monster is banished

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.130
from play, I can summon
a level 3 or below

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.990
fish monster from my hand!

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.690
And this one
has some bite!

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.760
Come out,
big jaws!

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.160
Not good.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.830
Now I'm in an even
bigger fix than before.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.760
Yes you are yuma, I was
afraid This would happen.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.990
What you failed to recognize is
that monster reborn can also

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.090
bring back a monster from
another player's graveyard.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.030
You could have brought back
friller shark, and used gagaga

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.260
magician's level
changing Ability

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.260
and then xyz SUMMONED
leviathan Dragon.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.560
And then you could have
used leviathan Dragon

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.730
to destroy aero shark.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.490
Ugh. Oh well,

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.790
I'll get him
next time!

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.990
After All, utopia has
2000 attack points.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.630
Shark doesn't have a monster on
his field stronger than that.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.260
Alright shark, make your move!

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.660
Never Mind about me,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.890
it's aero shark
and its ability

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.090
that you should
be worried about.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.560
Because now, just like before,
by using One overlay unit,

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.790
you take 400 points of damage
for every card in my hand.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.290
I have two,

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.490
so that's a
walloping worth 800!

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.730
Next I summon
skull kraken!

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.160
Two Level 3 monsters?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.430
It is alright.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.060
He still does not have
a card that can

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.490
destroy a number
like utopia.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.190
I now overlay skull kraken and
big jaws, and because I have,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.530
I can now xyz summon!

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.390
Welcome to the duel,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.290
the mighty Black Ray lancer!

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.860
And now for the best part,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.030
I activate lancer's ability!

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.930
By Using One overlay Unit,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.960
your utopia's ability
is negated this turn!

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.590
What?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.490
Nooo!

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.790
That's right, yuma.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.230
The ability where only a number

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.960
can destroy another
number is gone.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.630
So now your utopia can be taken
down like any other card.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.830
He's right!

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:48.860
Which Means,

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.560
my number's about to be
seriously crunched.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.660
Go black ray lancer,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.130
attack with
Shimmering Spear slash!

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.290
Utopia!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.690
I can't believe
it's gone.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.590
I cannot believe shark
knows a number's weakness!

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.860
Aero Shark,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.590
attack yuma!

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.360
Devouring dive!

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.260
So even with a
number, yuma lost!

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.960
He got trounced,
poor guy.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.690
Not just trounced,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.490
completely annihilated.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.530
I suppose now
I can tell ya.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.190
The reason that
I stopped dueling yuma,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.530
was because I was
crushed when you beat me.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.030
But I feel all better now.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.530
And this here is just
the Cherry on top.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.690
Then again,
keep it.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.890
As a reminder of
what I did to you.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.590
Shark No,

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.260
don't go!

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.460
Yuma, you and
I are finished.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.360
So don't you ever come
bothering me again.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.490
You may think those
friends of mine are thugs,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.690
but they're all that I have.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.230
And that's just
fine with me.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.990
Shark...

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.430
shark...

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.260
[engine revving]

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.090
I failed, astral.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.130
I failed.
