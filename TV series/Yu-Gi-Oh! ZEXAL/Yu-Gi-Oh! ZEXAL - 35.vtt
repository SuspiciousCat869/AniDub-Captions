WEBVTT

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.730
Duelist a: Hey!

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.190
CAMERON: Some say photos bring
back memories of the past,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.960
but mine do the opposite.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.030
They bring forth the future.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.390
And the future shows that
you'll be losing this duel!

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.490
What do you know about the
future? That camera of yours

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.560
ain't even digital!

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.330
I can sense the fear
behind your voice.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.760
And you are right to be afraid,
for you see the future has now

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.190
arrived.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.890
I hope you remember what
you learned here today.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.490
But if, when you wake up,
it's at all fuzzy,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.290
take a trip down
memory Lane on me.

YUMA: Ya know,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390
things sure are crazy right
now, especially with shark.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.960
You're competing in the
world Duel carnival!

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.590
SHARK: Only for as
long as I need to.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.660
As soon as I do what
I got to do, I'm out.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.430
What are you talking about?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.330
The duelist I lost to in the
nationals is in the carnival.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.560
I'm gonna settle the score.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.160
But it's not just him.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.660
There's quattro too.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.030
Quattro: I won't be happy until
all my fans get exactly what

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.590
they deserve.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.190
You two twerps are goin'
down with a big bang!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.860
You maniac!

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.260
They looked up to you!

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.560
Why did you do this to them?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.960
Let's just say that it I
find it highly entertaining.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.890
It's like no one duels for
the right reasons anymore!

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460
Everyone Wants revenge
or to hurt someone.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.130
Don't these people get it?

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.260
We're all cut from
the same cloth.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.460
We're a family.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.630
Tori: Whoa check it out, yuma.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.030
It's an airship.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.190
Bet ya it's flying high to
commemorate the world duel

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.760
carnival.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.660
How about I get tickets for us?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.830
It could really help you
take your mind off things.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.230
Nah, sounds lame.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.690
Aw, come on!

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.230
No, Tori, you come on!

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.360
My problems can't be solved
by some ride in the sky.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.890
You know what?

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.990
For someone who wants everyone
to get along, you sure are rude

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.730
sometimes.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.590
No, you are!

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.590
Aw, sorry.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.860
Well Yeah.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.130
You should be sorry.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.190
I was just trying to
cheer up my friend.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.030
But forget it!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.590
ASTRAL: I am curious yuma.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.930
Do you plan to tick off
anyone else today?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.230
Astral!

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.930
Mind your business, would ya?

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.090
Guess so.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.910
Could this day get any worse?

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.990
KARI: What's his name again?

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.390
Editor-in-CHIEF:
It's Cameron clix.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.790
He was some kid that
was always coming in my

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.790
office trying to get me
to run his Boring photos.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.430
Well he's not
just some kid anymore,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.730
he's the most sought after
photojournalist there is!

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.260
Every shot he takes is
front-Page material!

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.730
I don't know how he does it,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.730
but I do know I want
him for our paper!

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.460
So just hire him then.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.890
I would.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.160
If I could find him.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.590
That's where you're
gonna come in, Kari.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.730
What's that supposed to mean?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.430
the word on the street
is This Cameron

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.060
kid is big into dueling.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.130
so, it stands to reason that
he'd be at the duel carnival.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.930
I want you to find him and get
him to sign an exclusive with

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.560
our paper!

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.060
This kid better be
as good as they say.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.360
Duelist B: Quit it with the
photos and duel already!

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.390
Huh?

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.660
Is that?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.890
These aren't just photos.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.860
These show your future.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.290
Care to see?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.960
Then again, you'll be
seeing firsthand soon enough.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.390
I warned you, didn't I?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.860
All I have to do
is think and snap.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.690
Then, whatever I've
envisioned happens.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.890
No wonder I've
never lost a duel.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.390
Never lost?

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.860
And now my friend,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.160
here's something
for your scrapbook.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.960
Too bad No number card though.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.730
Wait!

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.460
Are you okay?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.990
I... should've
worn my... hardhat.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.390
These are the photos Cameron
took, but he took them before

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.330
any of this actually happened.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.090
Could that mean...

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.460
that Cameron can... think up a
future and make it come True?

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.330
look for the last time
yuma, do you know him or not?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.860
his name is Cameron
clix, ring any bells?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.990
No.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.160
No bells.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.330
are you sure?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.560
he's a duelist just like you.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.830
Sorry.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.390
Oh and he's big
into taking pictures.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.930
I just know he's competing
in the duel carnival.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.960
look, maybe he is,
maybe he isn't.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.490
why do you even care?

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.760
Because he's dangerous yuma,
and someone needs to stop him.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.990
Dangerous?

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.590
What do you mean?

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.860
I mean he has the power
to create the future.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.290
and it's a future that's
usually not so bright.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.730
Create the future?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.460
Yeah I know, I wouldn't
have believed it myself yuma,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.030
but I saw it.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.630
With my very own two eyes.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.930
Okay then,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.690
I'll be sure to
look out for him.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.030
thanks, bro.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.330
just be careful.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.060
this Cameron Kid said
he's never lost a duel.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.830
and after seeing
this power of his,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.590
I totally believe him.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.590
contact me the minute you see
or hear anything and I mean

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.160
anything! Kari out.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.790
Wow, that's some trick.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.390
Creating the future?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.060
I wonder how he does it.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.190
If what Kari is saying is True,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.530
I suspect

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.690
this young man has been
possessed by a number.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.230
You think so?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.290
How else could he
have such power?

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.160
Yuma, let us go.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.630
We must find this
Cameron at once.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.760
Man, what is it,
boss yuma around day?

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.030
Some manners huh, tor?

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.090
Tor?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.630
Tori?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.560
Where did she go?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.430
You were being mean
and thoughtless.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.060
So she left.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.930
Do you not recall?

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.430
Mean and thoughtless?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.230
I'm never like that.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.160
Tori?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.890
Tori?

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.460
Observation #17: Sometimes
individuals speak without

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.490
listening to what
they are saying.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.460
This is dangerous because
words are extremely powerful.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.990
They can hurt

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.560
dear friends.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.790
Announcer: Come one, come all,
come onboard the duel carnival

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.530
airship and experience the
majesty of this great event at a

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:38.130
whole other level!

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.530
You know what?

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.160
Yuma didn't want
to go for a ride.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.860
But that doesn't mean
that I can't go for one.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.230
Okay, everybody!

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.860
Say cheese!

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.690
CHILDREN: Cheese!

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.990
That's a keeper.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.560
Send me a copy!
See ya later!

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.730
Cameron?

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.690
Cameron, is that you?

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.160
Tori?

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.260
It's been so long, Tori.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.390
I think the last
time I saw you was...

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.590
Oh I know, when you let
me take those portrait shots!

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.160
That's right, and you did such
a great job with them, too!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.130
I still can't believe you
exhibited them at that art

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.130
festival.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.660
I was so embarrassed.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.060
Well you shouldn't be.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.760
You're a natural
in front of the camera.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.960
So umm, do ya wanna go
take some more shots?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.290
Maybe over there
by the airship?

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.460
What do you say?

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.130
M' sure!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.160
Are you certain you want
to do this, Cameron?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.890
I'm not dressed
up or anything.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.360
Maybe I should freshen up my
make up or brush my hair or...

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.230
no way.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.690
You look just great.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.660
Trust me on this.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.060
Well... okay then.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.560
See ya!

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.660
We've looked everywhere
for this kid Cameron.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.490
And still nothing.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.360
Course we might have better luck
if we knew what he looked like.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.060
Probably Should've asked.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.260
It sounds as though a
duel is in progress.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.190
We should check it out.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.190
Wait up!

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.530
My word...

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.430
a number!

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.830
Duelist C: No way,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.330
the images in those
photos you took, they're now...

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.960
Coming True!

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.330
Go projection of pain!

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.530
I tried to warn you but
you wouldn't listen.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.230
No matter, after all,
a picture's worth a thousand

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.730
words.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.230
Especially when it's a picture

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.560
of the future!

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.390
Whoa.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.760
Here you go,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.760
on the bright side, no red-Eye!

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.290
It's really True.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.230
This kid...

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.460
he can somehow
create the future!

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.860
Teammate A: Oh no! Don't worry.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.790
You're gonna be okay pal!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.790
The power of this number
card is most concerning.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.190
Then we better go
and get it astral!

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.730
Hey, wait up!

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.990
Are you Cameron?

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.760
Fine, don't answer me.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.590
But I'll tell you what.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.930
You will have to answer
for what you've done!

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.530
You've hurt a lot
of people, Cameron.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.690
I want to know why!

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.430
Why?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.860
It's quite simple.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.790
I do it to
acquire number cards.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.830
But numbers are rare.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.730
Not all of my opponents have
them, so some end up the worse

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.130
for wear.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.790
But that's not my problem.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.390
I'll do whatever I must
to accomplish my goal.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.960
To collect all the
world's number cards!

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.460
And then, the power of my future
photos will be even greater and

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.590
there'll be no stopping me!

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.330
He's definitely possessed by the
power of a number card, astral.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.660
Oh, I see.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.860
You know about
number cards, do you?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.930
Does that mean you have one?

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.160
That's right.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.760
Whatcha gonna do about it...

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.190
I told you to contact me
when you found Cameron!

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.660
Uhh Kari, meet Cameron.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.230
Nice to meet you, Cameron.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.190
I've been looking for you.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.890
Actually, it's really my editor
who's been trying to track you

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.560
down.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.230
You may remember him.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.890
You used to try and get him to
run your photographs in the

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.430
local paper, but sadly, he
always turned you down.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.860
Oh yeah...

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.430
I remember.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.230
He always told me that my
photos were too Boring.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.690
But my style has
changed since then.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.660
I know it has, which is why he
wanted me to offer you a job,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.190
Cameron.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.760
But Hey, you know what?

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.460
I'm going to personally see to
it that you never get that job

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.030
or any job, for
any paper anywhere!

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.690
Let me guess why.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.260
Might it be...

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.630
because you think my methods
are a tiny bit reckless?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.990
I don't know how you do it,
maybe you create the future or

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.760
maybe you just twist it,

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.430
but I do know one thing,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.190
enough people have been
hurt by your dark ways.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.690
It ends now!

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.760
No, it doesn't.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.830
You see, it's
never going to end!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.090
I know,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.730
because I make the future!

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.330
Seems Our worst fears
were correct, yuma.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.630
Now the only question remaining
is how do we put a stop to it

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.060
all?

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.560
How is right.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.990
Tell you what Kari, why don't I
just go ahead give you one of my

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.560
photographs?

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.690
Then you can leave me alone
and go make your editor happy.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.460
Not a chance!

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.330
You're starting
to get on my nerves.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.830
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.660
Can't you see that I'm
about to duel someone?

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.360
Yuma,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.330
there's no way you're dueling
this guy, it's too dangerous!

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.690
Come on,

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.330
think of this like a journalist,
after all, it could make for a

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.190
pretty good scoop.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.730
But then,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.560
there are scoops wherever I go.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.990
Take this snapshot
I took earlier.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.530
It's real headline news.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.530
Go on, don't be scared.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.660
Have a look-see.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.230
Tori!

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.890
Oh, do you know her?

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.530
Such a shame what happened.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.560
Or what's about to.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.330
I know statistically they say
flying is the safest way to

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.360
travel, but that's
not True today.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.330
And for Tori,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.930
I'm afraid that's some
seriously bad news, indeed.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.490
But that's just the start.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.630
It only gets worse from
there. After the crash,

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.590
chaos! Heartland City
will be in utter shambles!

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.330
You're a monster!

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.830
Oh Please,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.090
you just report the news.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.460
I happen to make it.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.760
My offer still stands.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.460
If you take the photo now,
I'm sure you can make the late

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.990
edition!

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.560
For the last time,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.760
I want nothing to do
with your photographs!

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.660
Then you're a fool.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.230
Tori, are you there?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.630
Answer me!

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.460
you Better be calling
to Apologize, yuma.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.960
Where are you right now?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.260
I'm on the airship. Remember
when I tried to invite you?

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.330
no.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.730
you have to get off,
you have to get off now!

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.060
You're acting weird.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.360
What's wrong?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.790
you tell me!

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.430
Uh, things are fine up here.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.090
The view of the city
is totally amazing.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.390
Are you sure about that?

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.060
There are no problems?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.860
No, none whatsoever...

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.360
Tori!

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.290
Passenger A: Whoa,
look at the wing!

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.130
That's the left engine!

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.830
tori, what's happening?

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.530
Hang on, tor!

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.760
That's enough.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.130
You put a stop to this!

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.460
Right now, Cameron!

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.790
Sorry,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.160
what's done is
done I'm afraid.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.090
No way, you
control the future!

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.530
You can change this!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.930
But don't you see?

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.860
This isn't the future
anymore, it's now the present.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.460
And I never said I had any
control over the present now,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.930
did I?

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.330
You little twerp...

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.860
if you lay one finger on me,
you'll only make things worse.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.490
Now if I were you, I'd quit
wasting time and try to help

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.930
those people.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.330
Hey, yuma!

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.990
I'll figure out how
to save the airship,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.090
you keep an eye on Cameron!

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.060
Ah. At last she's gone,
which means finally,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.960
we can duel.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.290
Astral.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.490
When a person possessed by a
number loses in a duel and Loses

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.430
their number, they
return to normal, right?

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.230
Right.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.890
So then there's a chance,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.830
that everything around us,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.930
will go back to normal too.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.330
It is hard to say,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.660
maybe...

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.960
then let's go!

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.430
Cuz I'm feeling

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.830
the flow!

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.130
Duel Disk go!

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:35.590
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.090
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.130
Alright, let's do this Cameron!

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.090
Hey, what are you doing?

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.160
The same thing I
do to all my opponents!

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.030
I'm taking your photo.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.430
Here.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.590
This is what you have
to look forward to, yuma.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.530
I will warn you though,
it's a bit of a spoiler!

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:12.990
As you can see, victory is mine
and so is your number card!

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.360
As you can see, my victory is
assured and your number card is

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.430
as good as mine!

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.290
In fact, you might as well
hand it over to me right now.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.990
No way!

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.730
I'm not buying
into your camera tricks.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.360
Let's duel!

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.990
I'll take the first move!

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.460
Here goes...

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.890
my draw!

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.860
First I place a monster
facedown in defense mode.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.260
Then I'm just gonna
place a card facedown,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.960
and end my turn!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.290
Very Well,

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.790
my turn!

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.130
And I'm summoning
out cameraclops!

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.690
yuma Placed GOGOGO golem
facedown in defense mode.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.960
It has 1500 defense points.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.460
the monster Cameron played,
cameraclops, has just 1400

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.290
attack points.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.190
that is good news, it means
yuma is safe for at least this

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.590
one round.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.160
I now activate the equip spell
telescopic lens from my hand!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.030
And What better place to
attach a lens than a camera?

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.330
But this doesn't just mean
a better picture, it means

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.890
cameraclops gains 400 attack
points for every card in my

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.460
hand!

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.860
I have four.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.860
So that's an additional
1600 attack points!

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.260
that's still not
enough to take down golem.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.560
when it's in defense mode, its
special ability prevents it

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.330
from being destroyed
in Battle Once per turn.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.830
Next from my hand, I activate
the spell card negative image

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.690
inversion!

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.660
and it's especially negative for
you because now I can switch one

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.890
of your facedown defense
monsters into a face-Up attack

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.530
monster!

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.930
And there's another development,
your attack points now swap out

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.730
with your defense points!

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.230
What?

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.690
Of course, since I used image
inversion, I now have one less

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.230
card in my hand.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.560
So cameraclops loses
400 attack points.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.230
But in the big picture, I think
we all know that you're the one

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.960
who's really losing!

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.260
Now go, cameraclops!

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.090
Attack Gogogo golem!

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.460
This is a special news bulletin!

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:51.490
An AIRSHIP above heartland
city is in grave danger!

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.530
Passenger B: Get out of the way!

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.890
Just Relax little girl,
everything's going to be just

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.790
fine... I hope.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.660
Don't you worry, Tori!

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.830
I'm gonna make
sure it's all okay!

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.660
But it's not!

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.460
Like I told you before, there's
no changing what's already

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.760
happened. And you'd better
believe there's no changing your

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.490
fate either, yuma!

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.090
It's already been decided -
You'll summon number 39: Utopia

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.590
on turn 5.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.830
Then, on the following turn,
you'll be defeated by my number

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.960
card!

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.330
You know yuma,

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.430
some say when a person
snaps a photo of someone,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.160
their soul is doomed!

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.230
Well, turns out they were right!
