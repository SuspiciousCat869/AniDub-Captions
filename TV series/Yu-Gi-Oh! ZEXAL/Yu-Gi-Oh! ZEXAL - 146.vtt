WEBVTT

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.469
You know what, Astral?

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.372
I'm really glad
I started dueling,

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.607
because when I'm dueling,

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.442
I don't care that
I was late for school

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:11.712
or that I flunked today's
math test, but uh...

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.647
don't tell Kari and grandma...

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:17.584
I can forget my problems
and just have fun.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.754
That's what I love
about it most.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.759
Hey, Astral...

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.529
What are you gonna do
after you get all the Numbers?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.567
I will fulfill my mission and
then return to Astral World.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.103
I know, I get that.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.739
But I mean after that.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.307
After?

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.543
I have not yet considered it.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.445
You haven't thought
about your future?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.714
(shouting)

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.750
The future is the best part!

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.752
That's where you can do
anything you want,

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.755
and anything can happen.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.223
Hmm.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.624
But I know you're leaving,

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.761
so you won't be here
with me to see it.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.498
Sadly, I will not.

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:04.864
Hey!

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.701
I bet you're thinking that
I'm gonna break down and cry

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.736
when you go away.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.739
You'll see.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.742
When you leave, my eyes
are gonna be bone dry.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.745
But before that,
we'll have one last duel,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.414
where I'll beat you so bad,

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.115
that you'll be
the one who's crying

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.319
while I laugh all the way home.

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.324

Yuma's really in trouble.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:43.096
He's down to 300 life points.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.765
And he has no monsters.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:47.567
The kid"'s in a
tight spot, for sure.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.070
Tight doesn't even
begin to describe it.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.007
Come on, Yuma, you've gotten
out of worse than this.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.008
I don't think so.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.579
Face it... when it's over,
it's over.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.381
What's Astral trying
to tell me?

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.750
I hoped to remind you
of what you have lost,

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:07.621
but the way you are dueling,
it was not meant to be.

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.557
Well, what have I lost?

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.491
Figure it out.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.696
I activate Overlay Accel's
effect and use one Overlay Unit

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:19.399
to allow Utopia Roots
to attack again!

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.404
Perhaps this will remind
you to examine the "roots"

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.707
of your problem.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:28.208
Attack Yuma!

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.509
This is quite fun!

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.477
(thinking) Fun?

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.245
That's what I've been missing.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.481
I've been shedding so many
tears that I forgot

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.417
that dueling is
supposed to be fun.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.186
That's what I've lost.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:41.021
I forgot to have fun.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.390
Thanks for
the reminder, Astral.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.425
Go, Danger Draw!

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.393
Since your attacking monster

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.762
has more attack points
than my life points,

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:51.765
I get to draw a card,
and if I draw a trap card,

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.234
not only can I stop
your attack,

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:58.472
but I get to
activate the trap too!

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.475
Are you enjoying this duel?

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:05.011
Because I'm having
tons of fun, Astral.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.079
Yuma.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.749
The ol' duel-loving
Yuma is back!

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.650
And I'm gonna win.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.586
But most importantly, Astral,

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.490
I'm gonna have fun
while I'm doing it!

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.691
Yah!

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.494
(all gasping)

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:23.764
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:28.635
He can even generate the very
cards that he needs to draw!

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.737
Go, Shining Draw!

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:34.374
Yuma, you can Shining Draw?

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.743
And guess what I drew?

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.178
A trap card!

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.214
So, that stops
Utopia Roots' attack.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:46.253
Then I activate my trap
Halfway to Forever!

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:52.492
I can Xyz Summon using two
monsters in my graveyard.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.727
Get set to get decked.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:59.996
I overlay Gagaga Cowboy and
Gagaga Samurai to Xyz Summon.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.737
Forge the path of destiny.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.740
Future Number Zero!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.276
Utopic Future.

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:32.766
Yuma summoned his own Number.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.704
Utopic Future?

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.073
Yuma, that's amazing!

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.744
Quite impressive, Yuma.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.379
I learn from the best.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.282
Then allow me to witness
what you have learned.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.751
Okay, you asked for it!

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.120
I draw!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.625
Utopic Future,
attack Utopia Roots!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.761
Utopic Future
has zero attack points!

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:05.432
So, why would you
attack my monster?

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.735
Is this another trick, Yuma?

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.537
You'll see!

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.706
(thinking) What should I do?

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.344
Roots, use your ability!

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:20.046
I shall be cautious
and lower Utopia Roots'

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:24.751
attack points by giving your
monster one Overlay Unit.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.754
I will spare you
from the equations needed

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.756
to calculate Roots'
attack points,

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.692
because you struggle
with basic arithmetic.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:38.231
In essence, Utopia Roots"'
attack points drop to 300.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:41.735
My monster's got
a special ability too.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.738
Utopic Future can't be
destroyed in battle,

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.740
plus I don't take any damage!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.141
And here's the cherry on top...

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:53.046
I take control of your monster
until the end of the turn.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:53.446
Oh, no!

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:59.085
Utopic Future, attack with
Rising Sun Future Slash!

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:07.627
Now Utopia Roots
joins the winning team.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.629
Go, Utopia Roots!

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.732
Attack Astral directly!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.005
Not bad, Yuma.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:22.275
I place one card face down
and end my turn.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:27.047
Your renewed love for dueling
has made you a fiercer foe.

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:27.614
You bet!

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:28.748
Now that I got my groove back,

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:32.452
there's nothing you can do
that I can't handle.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.053
Oh, really?

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:35.989
Do not forget that everything
you have learned,

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.757
you learned from me!

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:41.127
A master duelist can
create his own destiny

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.764
and will his exact card
into existence.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:48.401
Go, Cosmic Shining Draw!

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:51.705
Behold!

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:56.743
I activate Hyper
Rank-up-Magic Ultimate Force!

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.712
The moment is at hand.

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:04.117
I will rank up Utopia into its
highest form of existence.

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:07.153
Hyper Xyz Evolution!

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:11.458
Witness the pinnacle
of prominence.

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:28.508
Number 99...
Utopic Dragon!

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.584
Utopic Dragon?

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.452
How am I gonna beat that thing?

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.186
You cannot.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.356
That was the whole point of
summoning this monster.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.759
Furthermore,
Utopic Dragon can resurrect

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.328
one Number from my graveyard.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:54.067
Return to me, Number 39...
Utopia Beyond!

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.371
Not again!

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:03.076
Utopic Dragon,
attack Utopic Future!

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.210
Oh, please!

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.479
You couldn't destroy
Utopic Future last time,

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:09.582
and you're also gonna
fail this time.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.316
But that's fine with me,

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:13.753
because I get to take
control of your dragon.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:17.490
I think not.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.660
Due to Utopic Dragon's
additional special ability,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.631
it uses one Overlay Unit
to avoid destruction.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:32.305
Then it destroys all other
monsters on the field.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.009
Oh, great.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.481
(all gasping)

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:49.756
Nice try, but you won't
destroy my monster!

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:55.161
By using one Overlay Unit,
Utopic Future isn't destroyed.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.533
Too bad, Astral,
but I foiled your plan.

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:03.736
That was never my plan.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.504
What?

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:09.075
My plan was to destroy
my own monster,

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.276
because you now take damage

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:14.214
equal to Utopia Beyond"'s
attack points.

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:15.748
(screaming)

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:18.017
Oh, no!

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:21.020
Utopia Beyond has
3000 attack points.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.756
This is gonna wipe Yuma out!

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.464
(screaming)

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.667
Yuma!

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:39.072
I activate Utopic Future's
special ability!

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.411
Use one Overlay Unit!

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:50.116
By doing so, I take no damage.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.755
I end my turn.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.058
You survived.

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.663
This is our last duel together.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.765
I don't want it to end.

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.334
It's my turn!

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.739
I'm feeling the flow.

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:15.208
I draw!

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:16.576
Yah!

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:21.114
Utopic Future,
attack Utopic Dragon!

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.684
Now I gain control
of your monster.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:25.418
Not quite!

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:28.321
Utopic Dragon refuses
to fall under your command,

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:33.526
because its special ability
destroys Utopic Future.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.527
Like I'm gonna let that happen.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:40.366
Utopic Future uses one Overlay
Unit to avoid being destroyed.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.337
Yeah!
And I'm not done yet.

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:47.740
I activate the trap
Hi-Five the Sky.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.110
Utopic Future loses
all its special abilities,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.247
but it gets to attack again.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.750
But without its special
abilities, it'll be destroyed!

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.619
That will be catastrophic!

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:04.057
Next I'll play the trap
Memories of Courage!

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.759
Utopic Future gains
500 attack points

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.562
for every Number
in our graveyards.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.730
Since there are eight Numbers,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.269
Utopic Future powers up to a
whopping 4000 attack points!

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.612
Memories of Courage
has another effect.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:28.348
Even though Utopic Future
and Utopic Dragon

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.416
have the same
number of attack points,

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:34.420
my monster can't be destroyed
when they battle.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:43.463
And if I destroy your monster,
but don't deal you any damage,

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:47.133
Utopic Future can attack again!

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.539
(thinking) This is it.

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:57.477
If my next attack
succeeds, I win.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:02.749
(thinking) This is it.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:07.086
If my next attack
succeeds, I win.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.756
Let's do this.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:12.759
Attack Astral directly!

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:13.760
That will not work.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.764
I activate the trap
the Door of Destiny.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.502
The Door of Destiny?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.412
That's the door
that started it all!

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.747
We have come full circle, Yuma.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.283
The door has not only
stopped your attack,

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.352
but you will take
500 points of damage

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:42.655
for every Number that I
banish from my graveyard.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.325
Therefore, if you fail
to destroy this door

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:50.296
right now, Yuma,
you will lose this duel.

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.765
Destroy the door?

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.233
I can't do that.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.336
How can I destroy something
that represents

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.538
everything that
happened between us?

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.708
Because, Yuma,
it is your destiny.

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:06.279
Whoever can open this door will
gain a great, new power.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:10.316
But know that with
such a reward comes great risk.

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:15.755
You would lose that which is
most valuable to you.

00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:19.425
But then, that means...

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:23.062
What's valuable to me is you.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.630
It's you, Astral.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.032
Right now it's you.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.767
I have to lose you too?

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:30.703
(Astral)
You will never lose me, Yuma.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.672
Play your card.

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:37.210
Play it, Yuma, for your future.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.346
But if I do, if I beat you,

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:43.649
you'll be gone
from my life forever.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:48.321
But how can I be gone when
I live on in your heart?

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.657
Astral.

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.260
I'll do it.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.030
I activate the spell
Double or Nothing!

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:02.735
Utopic Future doubles its attack
points and can attack again.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:06.506
This is it, my final move!

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.753
Astral!

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.189
I'll never forget you, Astral.

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.225
You made me cry,
you made me laugh,

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.628
you made me the best
that I could be,

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:30.730
and I loved every moment of it.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.734
And now, our future's
waiting for us.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:38.638
A future without you.

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:41.174
Utopic Future attack!

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:44.677
Rising Sun Future Slash!

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.215
Astral.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.754
Nicely done, Yuma.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.490
Thanks, pal.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.762
It's the Numeron Code.

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:40.566
(all gasping)

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.669
It is time for us
to part, Yuma.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.571
I know.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.507
Thank you.

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:51.277
Don't worry, I won't cry.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:54.680
I have always enjoyed
seeing your smile.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.351
I will remember it, always.

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:01.654
Good-bye.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:07.760
Astral!

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.062
No matter how
many times I fall,

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.765
no matter how many times
I get laughed at,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.468
I promise to keep trying
to high-five the sky,

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:20.706
'cause when you're feeling
the flow, there's no going back!

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:23.743
Astral, we'll miss you.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.115
Thanks, Astral.

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.751
Thanks for everything.

00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:35.187
We"'re friends forever!

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.658
Likewise, Yuma.

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:41.561
Friends until the end of time!

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.666
Bye, Astral!

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.034
My final observation...

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:52.471
even galaxies apart,
friendship is forever.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.577
I'm gonna beat you
this time, Bronk!

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.745
It'd help if you
slowed down a bit though.

00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:03.749
Here's some advice...
try lightenin' your load.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.751
All right, Bronk, here I come!

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:10.756
And remember, loser has to do
whatever the other one says!

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.493
Bronk's... so...
fast.

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.429
Can't believe that I lost!

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:21.500
Well, believe it, Yuma,
or should I say Rainbow Kuriboh?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.168
Rainbow Kuriboh?

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:23.369
What are you
talking about, Rio?

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:26.105
Bronk won your race and he's
letting me decide your fate,

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:29.442
and I say you have to dress
as Rainbow Kuriboh for a week.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.645
You know, you'd think since my
pal Astral used the Numeron Code

00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:35.748
to turn you and the other
Emperors human again,

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:37.516
you'd go easier on me.

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.052
Would you rather dress
as Gagaga Girl?

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.154
Uh, never mind.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:45.658
He's the best dweeb
a friend could ask for.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:49.161
Mira, I hope Astral knows
how thankful we are.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.530
Of course he does, Kazuma.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.166
What he did...
bringing us back home,

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:58.604
and all of Yuma's friends...
he is truly remarkable.

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.172
Orbital, power up
your processors

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.041
and set your servos on high.

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.744
You and your family have
some data to digest.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:05.745
Yes, sir!

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:06.545
(robots) Yes, sir!

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.314
Gigakids, get your gears going!

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.549
I'll work with Byron, sir.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:15.755
All right, then,
let's dissect some dimensions.

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:18.591
(Yuma)
Yep, things are back to normal.

00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:21.994
Studying hard, watching
what I eat, sharing with my sis,

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:25.765
helping out, beating Bronk,
high-fiving the sky.

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:31.570
Everything"'s just like it was,
except one thing... Astral.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.447
(sighing)

00:19:42.448 --> 00:19:43.749
(whirring)

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:46.752
My key, what's it
trying to tell me?

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.054
Yuma!

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:50.389
(gasping)

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.224
What are you all doing here?

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.727
Since when did
you all become besties?

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:58.764
Sorry to interrupt your little
date, but we got trouble.

00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.765
There's something out there

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.169
that wants your buddy's
home to go bye-bye!

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:06.439
Astral's in trouble?

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.076
(thunder crashing)

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:13.512
An evil is gathering,
strengthening its forces.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:18.718
It is a power unlike anything
I have ever witnessed before.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:23.222
I fear a dangerous
new battle lies before us.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.657
Will you fight?

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:27.760
Yes, but not alone.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.528
We're really doing this?

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.331
We're going to Astral World?

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.235
Yeah, Astral totally
needs our help.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.438
He helped all of us, and now
we can return the favor.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.975
Your boosters better not
fail or I'm trading you in.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:45.077
Aye-aye, Master Kite!

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:48.280
I hope you brought your
"A" game, Quattro.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.750
Like I have anything
but an "A" game.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.417
Get real.

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:54.420
Dad, do you think the four of us
have what it'll take to win?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.758
You boys have not even begun
to tap into your true powers.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.761
The battle ahead may be
the toughest ever.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.763
We must expect the unexpected.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.532
You have a Galaxy-Eyes
master on your side.

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:08.067
How can we lose?

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:12.371
I"'m ready to go the distance
and KO the competition.

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:16.342
Yeah, I'm lookin' forward to
havin' a really good brawl!

00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:17.476
We can do this!

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.577
Um, you sure?

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:22.748
There's no way you can get
this job done without me.

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:23.749
Vector?

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:24.750
You're not planning to double,

00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:27.486
triple or quadruple-cross
us are you?

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:32.191
Don't worry, just trust in
the Ray Way and we'll be fine.

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:35.427
Yeah, as long as you don't mind
guard dogs and rose bushes.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:37.696
(Astral)
I do not know
what the future holds,

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.666
but if the past is
my guide to tomorrow,

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.035
I do not fear the unknown,

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.204
for the friendships I have
forged have shown me

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:50.142
that high-fiving the sky
can overcome any obstacles

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.545
that get in one"'s way.

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:56.315
Yuma?
Yeah?

00:21:56.315 --> 00:22:01.720
I just wanted you to know
that I'm Gagaga over you!

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:08.227
You ready to help Astral?

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:09.495
Yeah!

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:13.766
I am ready
to high-five the sky!

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.404
You don't have to feel
scared or alone, Astral.

00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:20.573

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:23.242
