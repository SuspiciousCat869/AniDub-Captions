WEBVTT

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:09.856
I'm getting sick
of these traps...

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:11.889
Pull yourself
together, Yuma!

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:13.689
Up ahead, there is
another trap!

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:20.323
Turn left,
please turn left!

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:23.223
(Yuma)
Whoa, whoa!

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.956
That was too close!

00:00:26.023 --> 00:00:27.056
Yuma!

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:28.623
You need to stay
more alert!

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.923
You almost got us--

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.156
...Yuma?

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:35.823
(Yuma)
Dextra...

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:37.023
Kite...

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.523
Quattro...

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:39.889
Quinton...

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.923
And Shark...

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.123
It's too much...

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.123
(Tori)
Hang on!

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.923
(Yuma)
Look...

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.589
(Tori)
Can't look
too bright...!

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:01.529
This must be
the desert field...

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:13.529
(Nistro)
'Bout time you
showed up.

00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:16.363
Nistro...

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.063
What are you
doing here?

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.163
Well, seems it's down
to you and me this round...

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.263
This is where we're
gonna duel...

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.963
And just so you know,
I don't plan on losing!

(Mr. Heartland)
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:34.236
There's only one spot left
in the semi-finals!

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:35.436
Who will advance?

00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:39.003
Yuma Tsukumo or Nistro?

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.536
We're about to find out
as we watch them

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:45.736
coast through
the desert field of danger!

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:46.736
You ready?

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:47.736
You know it!

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.969
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.836
I'm lookin' forward
to this!

00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:01.676
My turn, I draw!

00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:02.843
To start things off,

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.109
I'm calling forth Heroic
Challenger Double Lance!

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:15.743
(Mr. Heartland)
Whoa!

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.476
Looks like things are already
getting a little rocky!

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:20.843
'Cause in this field,
duelists take 200 points

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.843
of damage every time
they attack

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.509
or summon
a monster in attack mode!

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.643
After driving into
all those traps,

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.476
can you even
spare 200 life points?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.876
Does it look like it?

00:03:31.943 --> 00:03:35.043
I've only got a 100 life
points left to my name!

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.343
I activate Double
Lance's ability!

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.243
When I summon
an Xyz Monster,

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.809
Heroic Challenger Double Lance
counts as two monsters!

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:46.476
So now I overlay my two
Level 4 Double Lances!

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.809
With that, I build
the Overlay Network

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:53.243
and Xyz Summon Heroic
Champion Gandiva!

00:04:01.383 --> 00:04:04.949
He does not seem to be concerned
about the field spell damage.

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:09.016
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.616
All right, Yuma,
you're up!

00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:13.849
Give me
everything you've got!

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:18.649
'Cause this time, I'm ready
and I'm gonna take you down!

00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:27.086
(Nistro)
Come on, Yuma!

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:29.586
Give me everything
you've got!

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:31.719
(Yuma)
Considering how low
my life points are,

00:04:31.753 --> 00:04:33.686
I really don't
have much to give...

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.820
(Astral)
Yuma...

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.820
You cannot waver.

00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:39.186
He is clearly
feeling energized.

00:04:39.253 --> 00:04:41.086
You should become energized
as well.

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:43.220
Tell me somethin'
I don't already know.

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:44.520
It's my turn.

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:46.453
I draw!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.586
I got a little trap
action for ya'!

00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:49.586
Uh-!

00:04:49.653 --> 00:04:50.586
Uh oh!

00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:53.426
This is crazy...

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.626
I can't believe
I'm about to do this...

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:58.093
But Yuma's dueling has
really fired me up...

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.760
He's the reason I'm in this
tournament in the first place.

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:03.793
I don't want this one handed
to me, I wanna earn it.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.993
I've been looking forward
to this duel for a long time!

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.260
I play the trap
Heroic Gift!

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:12.760
When you've got
less than 2,000 life points,

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:16.293
this trap brings you back
to 4,000 life points!

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:21.493
Wait, you're giving
me life points?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.526
In exchange, I get to draw
two more cards from my deck!

00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:26.726
You're giving
me pity-points?

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.393
Don't think of
it like that...

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.293
I'm not exactly the type
to have pity on someone.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.193
I just wanna know
that when I win,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.760
it's not cause
I had an advantage...

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:37.893
(Astral)
If Nistro was willing
to so dramatically

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.626
boost Yuma's
life points,

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:43.226
he must be feeling
confident about this duel.

00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:46.760
I play a monster facedown
in defense mode, Nistro!

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:51.693
Yuma, you will not win this
duel through defense alone.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.533
Next, I place one card facedown
and with that, I end my turn!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.366
Ha!

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.266
I was hoping for
a lil' more than that.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.800
You need a push.

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:04.600
I draw!

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:08.833
And now I summon Heroic
Challenger, Night Watchman!

00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:18.033
Hey Nistro!

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.766
How'd those 200 points
of damage taste?

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.300
(Nistro)
Very funny!

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:23.966
But that was nothin'!

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:28.300
At least not compared to what
Night Watchman's about to do!

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.933
When Night Watchman attacks
your facedown monster,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.133
it automatically
destroys it!

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:45.333
And now your field
is wide open, Yuma!

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.733
Which means Gandiva
can attack you directly!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.600
I was hoping you
would do that.

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:51.766
Say what?

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:53.506
'Cause when Mogmole
is destroyed,

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:56.773
it can dig down and then
resurface in defense mode!

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.440
I bet right now you're
wishing you hadn't

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:02.806
given up those 400
life points, huh?

00:07:02.873 --> 00:07:05.973
You'd think so, but you
couldn't be more wrong, Yuma!

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.140
'Cause now I can I activate
Gandiva's special ability!

00:07:10.206 --> 00:07:12.140
By using one
Overlay Unit,

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:14.973
Gandiva can destroy
your Mogmole!

00:07:17.706 --> 00:07:18.806
This isn't good!

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.840
You can't just hide in
defense mode, Yuma...

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:29.406
Unless of course
you're a coward!

00:07:29.473 --> 00:07:33.373
All right Gandiva, attack
Yuma directly!

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.206
We'll see about
that, Nistro!

00:07:35.273 --> 00:07:37.340
I play the trap
Battle Break!

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:41.740
It destroys your Heroic Champion
Gandiva and ends the battle...

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:44.573
You think moves like
that can save ya?

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.973
Think again, kid!

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.206
My Battler's Pride trap
destroys your Battle Break,

00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:51.473
so Gandiva is still
alive!

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.946
Now Gandiva!

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:56.946
Fire!

00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:05.546
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:10.346
Don't you get it?

00:08:10.413 --> 00:08:14.080
You gotta duel like I know
you can if you wanna beat me!

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:15.346
Thing is...

00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:19.446
I know he's right, but I
can't afford to make a mistake.

00:08:19.513 --> 00:08:21.713
If that thought is
what drives you...

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.046
You should give up now.

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:24.113
What?

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.780
Right now, your dueling
is hesitant

00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:30.413
and a hesitant
duelist cannot truly duel.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.280
I suppose it is natural that
you are feeling this way...

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.380
After witnessing the intensity
of the last several duels,

00:08:36.446 --> 00:08:38.313
it is logical
that you would develop

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.413
a cautionary approach
toward your dueling...

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.580
Hold up!

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.613
It sounds like you're
saying I'm scared!

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.413
Well I'm-- I'm not.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.480
I draw!

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:48.680
Are you certain?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.246
I summon...

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:54.786
I summon Gagaga
Magician!

00:08:57.686 --> 00:08:59.053
(Nistro)
Watch your head Yuma!

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.520
Now I'm gonna activate the spell
card One-Shot Wand!

00:09:09.586 --> 00:09:13.320
This card grants my Magician an
additional 800 attack points!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:17.986
Which means it
can take Gandiva down!

00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.820
Go, Gagaga Magician!

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:22.453
Attack Gandiva!

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.453
You're gonna have to try
harder than that, Yuma!

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.286
I activate my
trap Heroic Advance!

00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:32.920
It not only doubles Night
Watchman's attack points,

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:35.253
but Gagaga Magician
now has to attack

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.920
it instead of Gandiva!

00:09:40.753 --> 00:09:42.720
Though neither monster
will be destroyed,

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:44.286
you'll still take damage!

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:52.826
Man!

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.893
All right, I activate
One-Shot Wand's effect!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.060
I can destroy this card...

00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:02.660
And in exchange, I can draw
a new one from my deck!

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:03.793
Sweet!

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.660
Get ready for Grandram!

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:08.093
When you've got an Xyz
Monster on your field,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.426
I can summon this big
bruiser in attack mode!

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.426
Sure, I'll lose another
200 life points...

00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:20.426
But now I can overlay
Grandram and Gagaga Magician.

00:10:20.493 --> 00:10:25.460
I build the Overlay Network and
Xyz Summon Gagaga Cowboy!

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:31.393
In defense mode?

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.260
Are you kidding me?

00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:34.393
(Yuma)
Nope!

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.126
Cause when Gagaga Cowboy
is in defense mode,

00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:39.160
it not only protects
me from taking damage

00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:41.660
when you attack, but it can
use one Overlay Unit

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:45.093
to blast you with
800 points of damage!

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:48.260
How do you like that?

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:51.093
You're goin' down,
Nistro!

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.400
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn!

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:56.266
I can't believe this...

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.900
Are you gonna hide behind your
cards the whole time?

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:00.833
It's totally pathetic!

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.966
I wanted to duel Yuma,
not some coward!

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:08.333
Guess I need to
force you to step it up!

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.833
By equipping Xyz Crown
on my Gandiva,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.800
I'm allowed to use
it to Xyz Summon!

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:17.466
And not only that, Gandiva
counts as two monsters!

00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:24.200
You meanm you're gonna use an
Xyz monster to Xyz Summon!

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:27.366
I overlay two Heroic
Champion Gandivas

00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:30.800
with my Level 4
Night Watchman!

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:32.533
I build the Overlay
Network

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.766
and Xyz Summon
Heroic Champion Kusanagi!

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.733
(Yuma)
How am I supposed
to beat this?

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.333
Come on!

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:02.433
If you wanna defeat me, then let
the real Yuma start dueling!

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:04.333
What do you mean
the real Yuma?

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:07.633
Stop playing it safe and duel
me like there's no tomorrow!

00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:12.899
Yuma...?

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.399
(Nistro)
Isn't that what it's
all about, Yuma?

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:24.333
(Tori)
What's going on?

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:26.099
Why did we stop?

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:27.433
I need you to
stay here, Tori...

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:28.433
Huh?

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:29.433
You want me to--

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.599
Yeah, I mean it.

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.899
I've gotta risk everything
if I'm gonna win this.

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:36.999
And I don't wanna put you
in any kind of danger...

00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:37.999
Yuma...

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:44.033
Just one thing.

00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:46.906
Don't forget to come back
and get me when you win.

00:12:46.973 --> 00:12:48.306
I won't!

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:51.973
You can do it, Yuma!

00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:57.339
(Yuma)
Hey, Nistro!

00:12:57.406 --> 00:12:59.106
If it's a real duel
you want, then

00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:01.206
it's a real
duel you'll get!

00:13:01.273 --> 00:13:03.906
Now that's the Yuma
I wanted to duel!

00:13:03.973 --> 00:13:05.406
Let's do this!

00:13:05.473 --> 00:13:09.373
First, I activate the
spell card Fighter's Charm!

00:13:09.439 --> 00:13:12.139
This forces your Cowboy into
attack mode...

00:13:12.206 --> 00:13:14.539
but its attack
points stay the same

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:18.873
as its defense points
for the rest of this turn.

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.306
But that won't
stop Kusanagi from wiping

00:13:21.373 --> 00:13:23.706
the floor with
Gagaga Cowboy.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.539
Kusanagi attack!

00:13:31.973 --> 00:13:35.273
I activate the trap
card Overlay Buster!

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:37.606
Thanks to this bad boy,
my Gagaga Cowboy

00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:40.206
gains 500 attack points!

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:46.012
I got this one!

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.179
I don't think so,
Yuma!

00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:50.546
For the price of one
Overlay Unit

00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:52.812
Kusanagi stops your
trap card and gains

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:56.212
500 attack points for
the rest of this turn!

00:13:57.946 --> 00:13:58.912
3,000?

00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:00.446
No way!

00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:02.046
(Nistro)
Do it, Kusanagi!

00:14:07.212 --> 00:14:09.379
Now his monster is
more powerful!

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:10.812
Let's go, Kusanagi!

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:13.412
Destroy his
Gagaga Cowboy!

00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:14.646
Not gonna happen!

00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:17.546
I activate the spell card
Fighting Fund!

00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:20.446
This card protects my
monster from being destroyed!

00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:24.813
Not bad!

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:26.779
But you're still takin'
some damage.

00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:30.613
(Yuma)
That was close!

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:34.346
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:34.413 --> 00:14:36.546
You got 600
hundred life points left.

00:14:36.613 --> 00:14:38.979
You're not doin'
so good, are ya?

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.613
I started with
a hundred.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:43.413
So the way I see it,
I'm rockin' this thing!

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:47.986
That's the Yuma
I know!

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.719
You showed up just
in time to lose!

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:06.119
What's this?

00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:07.286
What the huh?

00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:09.319
We are on a new field...

00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:11.186
It is now
Sunset Showdown.

00:15:11.253 --> 00:15:13.919
Each duelist can battle
with one monster only...

00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:15.619
and when that
monster is destroyed,

00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:18.886
its owner takes 300
points of damage.

00:15:18.953 --> 00:15:20.519
All right, Yuma.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.086
You ready?

00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:24.719
I'm feelin' the flow!

00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:26.253
I draw!

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:30.119
Gagaga Cowboy take
out Nistro's Kusanagi!

00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:32.353
Kusanagi's not scared
of your Cowboy,

00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:34.786
considering its packin'
more attack points!

00:15:34.853 --> 00:15:36.219
For now!

00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:39.219
But my Cowboy can use
one Overlay Unit to gain

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:42.119
1000 attack points and rob
Kusanagi of 500!

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:43.119
Heh!

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:44.319
Nicely done, kid.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:45.359
Gagaga cowboy!

00:15:45.426 --> 00:15:46.426
Attack!

00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:48.893
I activate the trap
Heroic Change!

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:53.059
But I use Kusanagi's special
ability to stop this trap

00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:55.893
so that Kusanagi can
gain 500 attack points!

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:11.126
Now that was awesome...

00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:13.426
You're an amazing
duelist.

00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:15.726
Right back at ya'...

00:16:15.793 --> 00:16:19.226
But it's time
to go all-in...

00:16:19.293 --> 00:16:22.393
I activate
the trap Xyz Extreme!

00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:25.226
Since an Xyz Monster
was destroyed...

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:29.359
By paying 1000 life points,
we both summon new Xyz Monsters,

00:16:29.426 --> 00:16:32.026
and then they have to battle
each other!

00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:33.759
Hope you're ready cause
I'm bringing out

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.893
the best my
deck has to offer!

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:37.526
Are you serious?

00:16:37.593 --> 00:16:42.026
I summon Heroic Champion
Excalibur!

00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:44.699
Time to slice your life
points down to nothing!

00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:48.366
Whoa...

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:57.159
(Nistro)
I summoned Heroic Champion
Excalibur!

00:16:57.226 --> 00:16:59.526
But after our Xyz
Monsters battle, they're both

00:16:59.592 --> 00:17:03.826
automatically destroyed because
of the trap Xyz Extreme!

00:17:03.892 --> 00:17:05.359
So bring it, Yuma!

00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:07.392
Make this the ultimate
showdown!

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.726
Go ahead
and summon Utopia!

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:11.092
Utopia?

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:13.392
Anything less would
be disappointing...

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:16.426
Let's make this a true
clash of the titans.

00:17:16.492 --> 00:17:17.859
You're on...

00:17:17.926 --> 00:17:19.826
You are goin' down,
Nistro!

00:17:21.992 --> 00:17:22.992
Nice!

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:26.792
I summon Number
39: Utopia!

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.159
Now come at me, Yuma!

00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:37.399
You asked for it!

00:17:37.466 --> 00:17:40.332
Utopia attack!

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:43.566
I activate Excalibur's
special ability!

00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:46.732
By using all its Overlay Units,
its attack points double!

00:17:53.066 --> 00:17:54.866
4,000 attack points.

00:17:54.932 --> 00:17:58.132
Utopia's got a special
ability too, ya' know!

00:17:58.199 --> 00:17:59.932
Light Wing Shield!

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:03.832
By using an Overlay Unit
I can stop Excalibur's attack!

00:18:06.099 --> 00:18:07.232
You can't touch me!

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:08.332
Perhaps!

00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:10.466
But when the dust settles,
both of our monsters

00:18:10.532 --> 00:18:13.532
will be destroyed
by my Xyz Battle trap!

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:17.566
And then Sunset Showdown deals
you 300 points of damage,

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:19.132
which means you're
finished!

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:22.932
That would be the case,
if I didn't have this card!

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:24.366
What?

00:18:24.432 --> 00:18:27.399
I am feeling the flow!

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:30.632
I activate the spell
Double or Nothing!

00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:32.832
This spell doubles
Utopia's attack points

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:34.766
and lets it attack again.

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:41.472
What?

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:43.806
It's got 5,000
attack points!

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:45.206
Go, Utopia!

00:18:45.272 --> 00:18:47.739
Rising Sun Slash!

00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:57.372
(Mr. Heartland)
It's over!

00:18:57.439 --> 00:19:00.939
The duelist advancing to the
semifinals is...

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:03.939
the one and only Yuma!

00:19:10.306 --> 00:19:14.772
Anyone get the license plate
of that rhino?

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:18.272
Nistro...

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:21.739
Been a long time since a duel
got me that amped up...

00:19:21.806 --> 00:19:22.839
That was awesome.

00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:24.406
Yeah!

00:19:26.472 --> 00:19:28.072
Yuma, I want you
to have this.

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:29.372
Huh?

00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:31.706
But in exchange, you gotta
promise me that you'll give

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:34.172
every duel everything
you've got.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.239
This is...

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:37.079
Excalibur?

00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:38.546
But this is, like,
your best card, and--

00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:41.312
Just say,
"thank you ."

00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:43.446
Seriously,
Nistro...

00:19:43.512 --> 00:19:44.712
Thanks so much.

00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:47.446
I'll do everything
I can to make you proud.

00:19:47.512 --> 00:19:48.446
Good.

00:19:48.512 --> 00:19:50.246
I'm counting on you,
kid!

00:19:51.846 --> 00:19:55.424
Win this thing.

00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:03.312
Come on, Yuma!

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:05.680
It's been forever!
