00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.530
Yuma: Last time
on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.960
Mr. Heartland: Enter.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.930
Did you retrieve
the number, Kite?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.490
Kite: I did.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.160
That's superb news.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.990
What's wrong, Kite?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.390
Now now,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390
don't tell me you're
upset about all the souls

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.360
that you've been capturing.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.390
Just promise me when all
of the numbers cards are ours,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.530
my brother will be okay.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.260
Ah, Dr. Faker.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.630
Dr. Faker: Tell me, what is
the latest in our undertaking?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.130
The latest is that everything
is going just as planned.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.530
And what a fine plan it is.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.060
What is it they say?
One man's trash

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.730
is another man's treasure?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.830
Well it's True, and with
that treasure we will

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.260
do what we must to
protect our future.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.890
Come on, Tori!

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.230
Tori: I'm moving
as fast as I...

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.260
Tori...

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
what's the deal?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.130
Tori!

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.290
[Whistling]

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.330
[Screaming]

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.660
Hey, why do you keep
freezing everything?

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.530
Things aren't exactly frozen.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.130
Time's simply moving at
1/10,000th of it's normal speed.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.190
Only people with numbers can
move freely in this field.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.660
Now you and I will
duel for numbers.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.290
Together: Let's duel!

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890
I xyz summon number 20!

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.960
Giga-Brilliant!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.690
Astral: He summoned two
numbers in just one turn.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.290

Two number monsters?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.060
And this number Hunter guy

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.930
summoned them both
in just one turn.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.830
Man, that was quick.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.490
Whoever this fellow is,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.960
he is certainly a force
to be reckoned with.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.560
Especially since it seems that
even though he craves these

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.160
number cards, he is not
under their dark influence.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.330
And now, I end my turn.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.930
Orbital 7: What a move!

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.030
Ending your turn!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.090
Right on!

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.290
That's not a move, gear-Head.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.030
Oh, sorry.
My bad.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.130
Well, here goes.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.260
My turn!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.630
I draw!

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.830
Gogogo golem!

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.160
All right!

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.190
Golem can't just take a
punch, he can take two.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.660
Ready?

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.060
Here's my move.
One monster, facedown,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.490
in defense mode!

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.630
Really?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.760
That's it?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.960
Fine!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.260
It's my turn again.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.560
And first I'm going
to do THIS:

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.160
Use illumiknight's ability!

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.360
Now, by using an overlay
unit and discarding a card,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.430
I can draw a card!

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.730
Alright then.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.390
Now I play
giga-Brilliant's ability.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.130
By using one overlay unit,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.860
giga-Brilliant gains
300 attack points.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.260
And now,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.830
giga-Brilliant attack!

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.060
Take out yuma's
facedown monster!

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.190
Sorry Hunter, sure
giga-Brilliant's has more attack

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.030
points than golem, But golem
has an ability that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.890
lets it survive an
ATTACK once Per turn!

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.790
Well, I guess then it's
a very good thing that...

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.260
I have plenty more attacks
where that one came from!

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.230
Go, illumiknight!

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.930
Attack With Shimmering
Sword slash!

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.860
Not good.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.130
He was my only monster.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.290
Now what?

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.690
Now you relax.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.430
There are no other
monsters on his field he

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.730
can attack you with.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.860
Oh yeah,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.030
I'm safe for now.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.960
Is that what you think?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.030
You're a very long way
away from being safe.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.290
And lemme guess,
now you're gonna show me why.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.830
I tribute giga-Brilliant
and illumiknight.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.790
Goodbye, you two!

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.260
And...

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.530
hello!

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.930
Hello?

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.430
And just who exactly are we
saying hello to may I ask?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.490
Here, why don't you
simply see for yourself.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.060
What's that?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.760
Uh... I don't like
the looks of this...

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.030
say hello to
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.430
[Roaring]

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.230
get ready to meet defeat.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.630
Cause my galaxy-Eyes
photon Dragon is

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.730
ready to seek and destroy.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.560
Whoa, seek n' destroy...

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.030
then we better be ready
to duck and cover.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.090
I know this creature...

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.390
I end my turn.
Make your move.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.060
Is there a move to make?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.730
Utopia is the only card in my
deck that stands a chance

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.390
against that thing.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.160
But to summon utopia out,
I need two monsters.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.890
So I guess I'd better get busy!

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.360
Alright Hunter, here I go!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.530
First I summon gagaga magician!

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.360
And the magic's just startin'!

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.160
next I play a spell card!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.030
Do your thing, monster slots!

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.590
You see, with this card,
by banishing a monster in my

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.730
graveyard that's the same
level as gagaga magician,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.130
I'm allowed to draw a card from
my deck, and if that card's the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.760
same level as gagaga,
I'm allowed to summon it!

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.830
Alrighty,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.960
here goes...

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.730
if I can draw a level 4
monster, I'm still in this!

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.360
I'm feeling the flow!

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.730
Draw!

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.530
All right, I did it!

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.030
I got just what I
needed, the level 4

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.030
ganbara Knight!

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.430
Welcome to the game, ganbara!

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.860
And now that I have
two level 4 monsters

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.760
out and about on my field,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.160
I'm gonna go ahead
and overlay them,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.560
so whenever you're ready, guys!

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.930
Alright, the overlay
network has been built!

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.230
Now I xyz summon!

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.360
Number 39: Utopia!

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.490
I'm countin' on ya, utopia!

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.030
Ah, the number
has finally appeared!

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.430
So dr. Faker,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.330
what do you think of my plan?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.460
A world duel
carnival is perfect!

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.360
I'm so pleased you approve.
I'll get to work arranging for

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.190
the tournament at once.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.690
I'll see to it all the finest
duelists in heartland are there.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.790
And of course, more duelists
from all over the world.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.660
Duelists with numbers.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.060
Quite right.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.330
Naturally, Kite
will participate.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.290
And then when he wins
the tournament,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.530
all of those wonderful number
cards will belong to us.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.690
Yes, but...

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.660
what if Kite should lose?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.290
What happens
then, Mr. Heartland?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.990
We should leave
nothing to chance,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.130
for these number cards are
of the utmost importance.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.960
There's no need to worry, sir.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.590
Kite won't lose.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.590
After all, his deck
is simply unbeatable.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.260
Our knowledge of the
other world has seen to that.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.090
Yes, a valid point.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.560
Very well then,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.560
it's settled.
Schedule this so-Called

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.830
'carnival' as
soon as possible.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.190
[laughing]

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.330
and the sooner the better, for
I have a great many sphere field

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.830
experiments to run.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.230
And this carnival of
duels will be the

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.060
perfect place to run them.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.330
Because with this sphere, I
can draw out a number's power,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.390
and then by using that power...

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.460
[laughing]

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.460
HART: Yes, it's
all working.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.760
It's working,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.430
the energy... is flowing...

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.890
[laughing]

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.660
Well done, Hart!

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.290
Make Astral world pay, make
them pay with your power!

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.290
Galaxy-Eyes has
3000 attack points,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.360
and utopia has only 2500.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.760
But even so,
I'm gonna attack!

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.230
Are you mad?

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.460
Maybe so astral, but I'm hoping
there's a method to my madness.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.530
Guess we're about to find
out right here, right now!

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.930
Time to feel the flow!

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:21.390
I activate the spell
card - Blustering winds!

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.090
Thanks to this card, my utopia

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.890
Gains 1000 attack and defense
points Until my next turn!

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.560
Alright, now utopia's the
strongest monster on the field!

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.890
Perhaps.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.130
Well, why don't we go ahead
and battle and find out?

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.660
Battle?

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.930
That sounds good to me!

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.890
Let 'em have it, utopia!

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.730
This is not going to be
a very pleasant sight.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.090
Got that right!

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.490
You can close you're
eyes if you're scared!

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.230
Not a pleasant sight for you.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.430
Say wha...

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.790
you underestimated
my Dragon's power,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.030
and now you'll pay the price!

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.390
You see,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.290
when galaxy-Eyes
battles your monster,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.090
both our monsters are banished.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.290
No!

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.190
Your attempt to attack
me failed miserably.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.630
What's your next move?

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.360
I guess I'll just
end my turn then.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.490
I was hoping that you'd say
that because now you see,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.930
galaxy-Eyes'ability continues,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.430
and the monsters that
were banished from play

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.960
return to the field.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.460
Utopia.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.790
You weren't destroyed?

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.860
Alright. With my utopia back,
I'm still in this duel!

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.330
Little fool.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.830
Still, you simply
do not understand.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.960
If the monster that galaxy-Eyes
banished from play was an xyz

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.590
monster, galaxy absorbs that
monster's overlay units,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.830
and gains 500 attack
points for each one!

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.190
Oh No.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.360
Utopia's overlay
units are gone?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.330
Indeed they are,
both of them.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.860
So if you do the math,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.160
galaxy-Eyes gains
1000 attack points!

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.890
4000 attack points.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.330
That's not good, that's enough
to take out all my life points!

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.530
That's right,

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.060
and then your number card
and your soul go Bye-BYE!

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.760
My soul?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.290
Wait a minute, is that what
happened back at the mall?

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.290
He looked like that
because he lost his soul?

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.930
You tin twit.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.090
I've already got this kid on the
ropes and you bring that up?

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.390
What is wrong with you?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.460
Sorry!

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.830
Won't happen again!

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.360
What's all this about souls?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.990
Tell me!

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.160
I suppose there's no point
keeping it a secret now.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.060
So okay.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.390
My method for taking a
number is somewhat forceful.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.460
So forceful in fact
that when I take it,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.130
that individual's soul

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.830
is taken as well!

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.030
What do you mean, taken?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.190
Where does it go?

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.360
Don't know,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.390
and come to think of it,
I really don't care.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.990
Don't care?

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.460
But you had better care yuma,
otherwise, we are both done for!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.130
That guy's got the upper hand,
so I think I better just place

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.290
one card facedown,
and end my turn!

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.260
Alright then,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.760
it's my move!

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.030
Now galaxy-Eyes,
let him have it!

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.030
Photon stream of destruction!

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.890
Even though Only a number
can destroy a number,

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.790
you're still gonna take damage!

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.530
Next I'm gonna play THIS:

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.190
The spell card - Photon wind,

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.090
and it will be knocking the wind
out of you because when I deal

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.530
damage without
destroying your monster,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:56.290
you take an additional
1000 points of damage!

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.990
So... He was planning on not
destroying yuma's number card!

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.490
And that's not all my
photon wind lets me do.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.060
Now I get to draw a card!

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.930
And then I'll place one

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.090
facedown!

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.330
And with that,
I'll end my turn.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.590
Astral...

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.290
as your life points diminish,

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.290
my life force does with it.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.560
I have you right in
the Palm of my hand.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.260
Can you feel the crush
of defeat closing in?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.430
It's my move!

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.860
Yuma...

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.760
come on, what are
you waiting for?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.190
do it.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.960
Here goes... I draw!

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.160
but even if the luck of
the draw is with me,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.130
that may not be enough.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.030
after all, I was able to bring
out my very best card utopia,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.890
and it didn't help me
at all. But wait,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.230
only a number can
destroy a number,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.460
and his monster
isn't a number.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.230
so maybe I wasn't having utopia
help me in the right way.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.030
maybe I need to put
him in defense mode!

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.760
A risky move.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.690
He went so far as to get rid of
his number cards so he could

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.490
summon galaxy-Eyes.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.290
He is sure to have a
plan in place for you

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.390
playing a number in defense.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.160
So what do I do?

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.490
The only thing you can do
in a moment like THIS:

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.360
You hunt the Hunter.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.930
You mean keep attacking?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.430
Hoping that something will work?

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.630
But if it doesn't,
we're both done for.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.890
That is True.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.030
But I would rather go out
with a bang than a whimper.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.460
Do you feel the same?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.730
Of course.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.960
So let's get to it!

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.830
Well alright then.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.830
Now the only question is,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.660
what is our next
move going to be?

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.930
I don't know.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.190
With so much on the line,

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.330
my head is swirling.
I can hardly think straight.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.990
Then think back to
a time like this.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.230
A time with a lot on the line,
how did you get through it?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.590
Yuma's father:
Feel the flow son,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.890
and climb!

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.960
Astral, my head's clear.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.760
I know exactly what I need
to do to turn things around.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.690
I need to feel
the flooooowwww!

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.930
I now summon out
zubaba Knight!

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:40.290
Next, I activate
copy Knight!

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.060
This trap copies my monster,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.090
so now I have two
zubaba knights!

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.090
Next, I'll overlay them both
so that I can create THIS:

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.090
An overlay network!

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.330
And with it,
I can now xyz summon!

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.530
So come on out

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.230
number 17: Leviathan Dragon!

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.590
Did he say 'number'?

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.390
yep, it's confirmed!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.590
Master Kite, it's
another number monster!

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.490
So then you have two, eh?

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.730
I wonder,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.630
does that mean that you're
a number Hunter as well?

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.160
I sure hope so and
do you know why?

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.830
Because then you'll have all
the more for me to snatch!

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.760
Yeah, we'll see about that!

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.130
I play leviathan's ability!

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.790
By Using an overlay unit,

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.130
leviathan Dragon gains
500 attack points!

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.390
So what? Even with that boost,

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.190
galaxy eyes remains
the stronger beast!

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.330
Oh I don't care
about who's strongest,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.890
and here's why:

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.630
The spell card - Cross attack!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.360
When I have two monsters with
the same attack points, one of

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.960
them can't attack, But the other
one can attack you directly!

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.530
And thanks to that boost,

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:10.190
utopia and leviathan now have
the same attack points!

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.260
So let loose, utopia!

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.590
Attack him directly!

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.330
So predictable.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.330
Go rising sun slash!

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.230
You didn't think I'd let a
simple spell card defeat me,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.490
because it won't be.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.460
And now allow me
to show you why.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.890
I play the trap -

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.730
Lumenize!

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.130
Now your utopia's
attack is negated,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.130
and galaxy eyes photon Dragon
gains its attack points!

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:50.030
So... Galaxy eyes
is even stronger now?

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.160
That's right!

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.390
To the tune of 6500!

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.090
Just stay calm.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.590
But we're done for.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.460
No, we are not.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.660
So what now?

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.160
I will tell you what:

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.430
We make the only
move left to make.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.560
Yeah okay,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.090
what is it?

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.960
Place the trap in
your hand facedown!

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.290
What, ya mean this?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.660
Mirror mail?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.860
But how will
that help... Unless...

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.130
that is right.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.560
With mirror mail, when
your opponent wages battle,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.060
mirror mail will change
utopia's attack points

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.060
so that it equals
those of galaxy eyes.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.830
Oh wow.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.660
And even though our monsters
attack Points would be the same,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.360
a number can only be
destroyed by a number.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.090
Which means galaxy-Eyes would
be destroyed, But not utopia!

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.790
That's it astral,
that's how we'll win!

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.590
Then let us get to it.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.830
Don't have to tell me
twice. I play a facedown,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.090
and end my turn!

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.830
You're doing great, Hart!

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.260
Use your power.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.060
Use all you can!

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.190
[Screaming]

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.290
my turn.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.030
I draw!

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.030
bring it!

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.660
do it.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.930
attack!

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.160
I summon forth photon cerberus!

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.560
And when cerberus is
let off it's leash,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.460
your trap cards are put on it.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.990
Oh no!

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.830
So then mirror mail won't
be able to activate?

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.390
That's right.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.830
Which means your last
ditch effort to beat me

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.930
has failed, and you're
now all out of moves!

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.090
He knew.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.560
Somehow he knew.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.860
He has out-Dueled us both.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.460
And now your soul
and number cards

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.860
will be mine!

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.890
Galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.590
Prepare to attack!

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.960
Is this it?

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.860
I am afraid so.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.230
Farewell.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.700
Galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.500
Prepare to attack!

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.730
Big brother...

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.360
go photon stream of...

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.830
incoming message.
Master Kite!

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.930
Hart!

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.260
We'll finish this later.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.860
But now,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.890
I must leave.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.030
Come on,

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.190
we must hurry!

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.960
Then let's roll!

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.430
Did I just miss something?

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.730
Yeah, me getting schooled.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.960
Now I know, when
the stakes are high

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.030
and everything's on the line,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.530
I don't have what it takes,
even when I feel the flow.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.830
It's on me, astral.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.960
Not you.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.090
I let us down.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.390
Me...

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.330
[crying]
