WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.060
Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.460
BRONK: Wait up!

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.890
TORI: Yuma...

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.690
where on earth are you going?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.960
Yuma: To go duel shark.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.660
This is where I heard
he's been hanging.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.960
Weasel: Well what
do we got here...

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.760
if you're looking for
trouble, it's found.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.060
Chills: Hey scorch,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.390
what's the next move?

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.960
SCORCH: Teach' em a lesson.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.360
Shark: Stop.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.660
Let go of the little brats.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.890
You shouldn't have come here.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.260
I came here,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.090
cause I have business
with you, shark.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.590
What business?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.830
The business of
duelin', that's what.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.330
I can't duel you.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.990
How come?

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.230
Because I quit dueling.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.990
This shark stuff's
got me down, astral.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.630
I gotta help him feel
the flow again.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.560
Cause if I don't, he might
call it quits forever.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.960
I finally lost him.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.630
Shark!

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.330
You're not losing anything,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.590
except the duel we're
about to have!

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.430
What do you say?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.130
Aw come on, I thought
we were friends!

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.790
And as your friend I'm gonna be
the one to tell ya, that it's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.060
time you dump those thugs
you've been hanging out with.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.960
It's none of your business
who I hang out with, yuma.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.230
Oh yeah?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.690
I'll make it
my business.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.530
I beat you, and
you ditch them.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.690
Yeah?

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.830
And what do I
get if I beat you?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.390
Well then, you...

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.660
you get to have this.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.790
You got yourself a deal.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.360
Together: Let's do this!

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.830
Aero shark!

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.360
Attack yuma!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.590
Devouring dive!

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.130
The reason that I
stopped dueling yuma,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.260
was because I was crushed
when you beat me.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.230
But I feel all better now.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.930
Then again, keep it.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.460
As a reminder of
what I did to you.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.290

You ready yuma?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.890
I summon ufo turtle
in Attack mode!

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.930
Shoulda stayed in
your shell, turtle!

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.990
Cause gagaga magician's
comin' for ya!

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.530
CASWELL: I must admit,
sometimes yuma confounds me.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.230
If I suffered the epic fail
that he just experienced against

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.130
shark, I'd seriously consider

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.790
hanging up my duel
disk for good.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.160
I play rush recklessly!

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.360
Oh No. It's gaining
more power?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.190
Perhaps in the end, yuma
simply doesn't have any pride.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.930
Ufo turtle, attack
gagaga magician!

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.430
That's twenty
losses in a row.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.230
Nice bait n' switch, bronk.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.490
I did not see that
spell card coming!

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.230
C'mon, one more time!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.060
You still feel
like dueling?

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.390
Of course!

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.390
What future duel champion
doesn't feel like dueling?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.730
C'mon big guy,
bring it on!

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.760
Meatloaf's getting cold,
I'm goin' home.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.160
Oh, well.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.760
Looks like you're
up, Caswell.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.760
Bust out your deck
and let's do this!

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.090
Bronk, hey wait up.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.530
What's wrong?

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.530
I just don't think I like
who yuma is turning into.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.390
That duel...

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.930
with Shark... yuma said
he wouldn't use a number.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.430
But then, he did.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.930
He went back on his word.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.360
And that's not right!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.630
You know how he is.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.060
He just gets
carried away and...

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.660
there's a big difference
between getting carried

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.730
away, and what he did!

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.990
You don't break a promise
just 'cause you're losing!

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.890
Wait a sec...

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.030
bronk's right.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.990
Thugs: Haha, denied!
Nice move!

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.760
Haha, gotcha!

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.830
Hey shark. You
want next game?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.460
No thanks.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.390
I'm outta here.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.760
That new fish is getting
on my last nerve.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.060
He acts like he's so much better

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.060
than me and the
rest of the boys!

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.760
Just deal with it, weasel.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.690
Cause that new fish is
worth a lot more to us than

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.290
you're ever gonna be.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.660
We didn't let shark start

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.930
running with the pack because we
like his winning personality.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.030
We let him start running with
us because We like his winning.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.030
And if he wins for us, we can
take down whoever we want.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.830
Hey, bronk!

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.160
Hold up!

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.130
Let's have a duel!

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.330
I'm done duelin' you, yuma.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.660
Fine, then!

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.160
I don't need to duel you!

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.960
I know better people
I wanna duel anyway!

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.390
ASTRAL: I would not bother.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.130
In your current
state of Mind,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.590
you could duel a
tree and still lose.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.290
Your strategies are always
sloppy and ill-Conceived.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.490
But right now, you do not even
have those at your disposal.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.030
You just keep attacking and
attacking without any thought.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.360
You don't know what
you're talking about!

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.960
Your recent defeat against
shark has rattled you.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.660
But yuma, while it is True
he is a fabulous duelist,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.190
I strongly suspect that it is
not the only reason he won.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.060
What do you mean by that?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.560
He seemed to have
taken the time

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.230
and analyzed your deck and
figured out your strategies.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.130
How much do you know about his?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.030
Well uhh...

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.060
so, are we just talkin'
about doin' this,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.160
or ya' know, are we
talkin' about doing this?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.430
Female REPORTER: I'm reporting
live in Midtown, where the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.730
city museum has opened
a new exhibition.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.060
Oh, we're talkin'
about doin' this.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.860
The exhibition's centerpiece is
an extremely rare and powerful

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.590
duel deck which
was donated to

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.260
the museum by an
anonymous benefactor.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.290
A panel of leading
experts has yet to confirm

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.260
just who the deck
originally belonged to.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.590
Heh, well after Tonight, that
deck is gonna belong to us.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.260
This seems really dangerous.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.690
What about museum security?

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.190
What if we get busted?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.460
They'll catch us
and my parents'll

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.960
send me to boarding
school and...

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.290
look ya' little worm, if you
wanna run with the pack,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.560
you need to start actin'
like a Wolf!

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560
I... I know, I'm just
sayin', maybe we...

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.960
we're gonna be fine.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.460
Don't forget weasel,
we've got these.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.960
a number card...

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.690
these are our tickets in.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.690
As long as we got
these bad boys,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.730
we can do whatever we want.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.230
And no one can stop us.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.990
Alright then, we'll meet by
pier 14 at midnight tonight.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.390
Well, but what about...

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.130
C'mon what's a matter,
little weasel?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.290
You chicken?

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.360
No! Just...

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.230
what are you doin' out here?

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.690
I hope you weren't listening in
on our private conversation.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.160
Cause if you were,
we might have a problem.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Well I was,
and I want in.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.660
Then you got in.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.560
Just don't
get in the way.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.930
Cause if you do, you'll
have to deal with me.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.460
This is not good.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.660
I'm gonna spend the next 5 years
of my life eating cold cafeteria

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.590
slop and arm-Wrestling
for respect.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.690
I can't arm-Wrestle, I have like
zero upper body

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.890
strength, my family is all legs,
we're not built for...

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.490
listen, there's a 5:15
train out of town.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.360
You should be on that.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.330
Eh? But what about all my
friends and my stuff and...

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.960
how much is a ticket,
'cause I don't...

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.490
just go!

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.530
Unnnnnh!

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.690
Why is finding
info on shark so hard?

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.560
What does
"Invalid path" Mean?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.260
You don't come to
the library much, do you?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.030
You're in the wrong browser.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.290
You wanna Click here.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.660
Last year's national
duel tournament?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.060
Just checking
something out.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.530
"Disgraced Contender Reginald
kastle was disqualified when..."

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.660
Shark's real name is "Reginald?"

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.260
I didn't know that.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.660
"Duelist Reginald kastle was
disqualified in the finals when

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.230
it was revealed that he
had secretly

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.660
looked at his opponent's
deck in violation of

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.260
tournament rules."

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.190
I hope nobody sees
me leavin'.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.090
train, here
I... wait!

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.330
I can't just leave
shark to those guys.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.890
Unbelievable.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.090
Shark was kicked out
of the tournament.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.560
It's gotta be a lie.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.490
But the article said.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.390
I know, but...

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.390
I've dueled shark, Tori,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.130
I can tell he's got the
heart of a True duelist,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.730
he's not a cheater.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.990
Yuma...

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.430
hey!

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.790
You're one of those guys that
shark hangs out with, right?

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.660
What do you want?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.490
Shark's... in... trouble!

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.590
What do you mean,
what kind of trouble?

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.230
He and the other guys
are gonna break

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.590
into the museum and
steal that rare deck.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.730
It's all 'cause of
t cards they got!

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.530
Every since they got 'em,
they've been doing crazier

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.430
and crazier things!

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.890
Yuma, are you thinking
what I am thinking?

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.990
I know how these guys roll,
they're probably gonna make

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.130
shark take all the blame,
he's gonna go down, he's...

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.530
yuma, hang on a second!

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.290
Shark's trouble.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.460
Maybe it's best
to forget him?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.830
I can't Tori,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.860
I have to help him.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.090
But why?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.660
It's not like he'd
do the same thing for you.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.260
You don't get it!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
I'm not just doing
this for shark.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.460
I'm also doing this for me.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.230
I lied to myself, Tori.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.460
I wanted so much to cream shark
the other day, so much that

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.330
I broke my promise and
used a number. And lost.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.030
Now, shark's in danger.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.290
All because beating him mattered
more to me than helping him.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.990
Why hasn't weasel
shown up here yet?

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.990
Forget about him.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.260
But he was going
to be our...

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.230
I said forget him, chills.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.330
We don't need him anymore,
now that we've got shark.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.830
Let's roll.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.490
Who are you?

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.090
I'm the kid that's gonna stop

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.630
you from doing what
you're about to do.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.930
Really?

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.360
This isn't a sandbox
you wanna play in.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.060
They both have
number cards.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.260
If you guys wanna take
another step forward,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
you're both gonna
have to duel me!

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.690
Is that so?

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.390
What's the Wager?

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.430
If you manage to defeat me,
then my number card is yours!

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.330
He's out of his mind!

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.230
But if I win, then you
walk away from this museum.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.830
His card's just
like ours, scorch.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.160
I get it...

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.290
so this is called
a number card.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.230
Imagine how strong we would
be if we had another one.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.860
Are you sure you wanna
do this, pipsqueak?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.060
I'm sure.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.530
I can take
both you guys!

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.930
Yuma, don't be crazy.
Two on one?

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.260
I won't back down!

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.830
I'm not gonna step aside and let
you throw your life away, shark!

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.930
Save it, yuma.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.490
I don't need you
looking out for me.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.490
Sorry, but I can't
just turn away!

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:51.030
These thugs don't care about you
shark, they're just using you!

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.530
How do you know that
I'm not using them?

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.330
Either way, I'm right
where I belong yuma.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.490
You're wrong!

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.560
You're better than this
Reginald, and you know it!

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.330
I'm gonna get you to cut your
ties with these lowlifes,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.390
if it's the last thing I do.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.390
Why do you even care so much
about what happens to me?

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.030
I care because
I'm your friend, shark!

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.360
Forget it,
I am not goin.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.260
He knows he made
a mistake, bronk!

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.530
And to make up for it,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.890
he's about to duel so he
can save shark's skin!

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.260
Yuma Needs his friends.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.530
Aren't you his friend?

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.430
Well bronk?

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.530
We need to clear
something up.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.760
When you challenge one of
us, you challenge all of us.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.360
This isn't two on one.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.690
This is gonna be a
three on one battle.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.630
You ready, shark?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.060
Whatever you say!

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.760
I don't care if it's
two or three or five!

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.560
Cause I'm fighting
for my friend.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.030
Actually,

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.260
it's gonna be
two on two.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.560
It's what?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.290
You really think that
you can betray us?

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.690
Are you sure?

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.690
Don't get the
wrong idea.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.890
I'm just not really a
big fan of these guys.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.060
Well guess What, we ain't
big fans of you either.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.490
Cause ya see shark,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.160
if we got caught,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.130
chills and I were gonna see
to it that you took the fall.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.790
Well the only people who are
gonna fall tonight are you two!

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.090
Duel Disk go!

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:34.130
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.430
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.000
Together: Let's duel!

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.360
Whad'ya say we get
this duel started?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.630
It's my turn!

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.990
I draw!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.660
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.990
Next, I end my turn by
Placing two cards facedown.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.360
It is apparent from the way
they are interacting,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.730
that these two are used
to dueling as a team.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.160
I'm not worried!

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.060
Here I go, heh heh!

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.290
I summon zubaba Knight!

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.230
That facedown monster is looking
like an easy target right now!

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.060
Go zubaba Knight,
jump in and...

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.730
not so fast, yuma!

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.130
Why not?

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.060
Cause in a tag duel, you can't
attack until all players have

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.260
taken at least one
turn, smart guy.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.560
Oh really?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.630
In that case,
I end my turn!

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.930
What a rookie.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.290
This is going to
be a piece of cake.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.490
It's my turn!

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.960
I draw!

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.890
I summon pompadour blizzardon!

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.560
Then I place two cards
facedown, and end my turn!

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.330
Once This train gets
goin', it doesn't stop.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.830
You are gonna wish you
stayed in bed tonight, kid.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.390
Well you're gonna wish you
stayed outta the water.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.490
Cause I'm summoning big jaws!

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.930
And that lets me also
summon shark stickers!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.590
See, I can bust
out this monster

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.790
whenever I summon a fish-Type
monster to the field!

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.430
That's two level threes
back to back. Do it!

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.130
I overlay big jaws
and shark stickers!

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.590
With These two monsters, I can
build the overlay network and

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.230
xyz summon SUBMERSIBLE
CARRIER aero shark!

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.960
He xyz summoned
on his first turn.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.160
That is all
kinds of awesome!

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.690
And now I activate
it's special ability!

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.260
Once a turn, by using an overlay
unit, aero shark can dish out

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.090
400 points of damage for
every card in my hand!

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.930
An excellent move.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.290
He is skirting
around the rules

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.430
by using a special
ability to deal damage.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.530
Since I've got four
cards in my hand,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.990
I'm serving up 1600 points
of damage to scorch!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.430
That's what I'm
talkin' about!

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.460
[Eerie laughter]

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.060
We were hoping
you'd do that.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.830
Hehe, I activate my trap.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.060
Blizzard egg
level 5!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.590
When a special
ability deals damage,

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.360
Blizzard egg enables the
duelist who took damage

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.390
to summon one level 5
Monster from his hand.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.290
But if he has no
monster to summon,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.230
then that duelist gets
slammed for 500

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.630
points of damage himself.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.060
So that means...

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.260
he is gambling on scorch having
a level 5 monster in his hand,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.930
which is quite a reckless
risk for him to take.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.030
Let's see here...

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.760
I summon level 5
baggy Pants lavasaurus!

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.560
And now,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.760
to really heat things up,
I activate my trap!

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.490
Flame Egg level 5!

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.190
When I take damage from a
special ability, flame egg

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.460
grants my teammate the
power to summon one

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.360
level 5 Monster
from his hand.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.290
But if he's not holding
one to summon,

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.760
then he takes 500
points of damage.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.690
This can't be good!

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.360
You're about to learn
why nobody messes with us!

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.230
Something is
not right here.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.560
Both of them had level 5
monsters waiting in their hands?

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.730
Aw man...

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.730
they summoned two powerful
big guys in one move,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.390
and it wasn't
even their turn.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.830
That's because we've mastered
the art of the extended combo.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.660
Did we forget to
mention that no one has

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.330
ever defeated us in a tag duel?

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.030
There is something not quite
right about this scenario.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.490
Why are these two so confident?

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.130
I think I smell a rat.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.290
And now, our combo's
big finale!

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.130
Glare Level 5!

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.860
Thanks to the power
of this trap,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.660
you take 500 points of
damage for every level 5

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.660
monster on our fields.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.490
We've got two level fives out,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.130
so we're talkin' a
thousand points of damage!

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.190
and it's all for you, shark.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.790
Are you okay?

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.130
Huh, that'll teach
you, traitor.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.530
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:45.330
I just had to step up and act
all tough. What was I thinking?

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.660
What if I'm still too rattled?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.930
Stay focused, yuma.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.530
We're not gonna win this
thing if ya start feelin'

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.690
sorry for yourself.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.960
He's right.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.930
It's like astral SAID:
i let my defeat rattle me.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.090
I can't do that.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.360
I've gotta stay strong.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.230
And now the fun
really begins!

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.860
First, I switch my facedown
monster to attack mode.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.230
Here comes flamesaurus!

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.790
A tag duel?

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.590
Why are yuma and shark
on the same team?

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.330
Flamesaurus' special
ability activates!

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.260
And that means it
becomes level 5.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.330
Now I can overlay flamesaurus
and baggy pants lavasaurus!

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:39.130
With These two monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.790
I summon number 61!

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.890
Volcasaurus!

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.930
Okay Wow, that's
like... humongous.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.890
Look at that thing!

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.930
Nice Goin', scorch!

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.460
I'm not done yet. I'm
gonna make it known

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.660
what happens to little chumps.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.760
I activate volcasaurus'
special ability!

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.860
By Using One overlay unit, one
of your monsters is destroyed,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.530
and you take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.160
Say Bye-Bye
to aero shark,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.860
and say hello to
a world of hurt!

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.660
Don't you know who we
are, you little runt?

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.530
Nobody gets to betray the
pack and then just walk away!

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.090
No, shark!

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.360
I wouldn't be
worried about him.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.760
E next, I'm destroying
your little zubaba Knight!

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.490
Yuma!

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.660
My grandma punches
Harder than that!

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.890
Ha!

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.390
Big words coming from a bug
who's about to be squashed.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.030
Your number card's
as good as ours!

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.000
[Eerie laughter]
