00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.540
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.040
FLIP: This Candy piece scam
is workin' out sweet for me!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.840
I already collected four heart
pieces that fit and I only need

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.700
one more to make the finals.
I guess using one piece of Candy

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.200
to complete my heart
piece couldn't hurt.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.440
Yuma: Flip!

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.740
Yuma, help!

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.470
What are you planning
to do with flip?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.770
NISTRO: This cheat made
fake heart pieces.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.670
He's gonna pay
with his deck.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.200
And he'll be banned from
competing in this and all future

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.770
duel carnivals.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.300
Hey, wait a minute!

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.070
You can't just
ban him forever!

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.140
How about we settle this
honorably with a duel.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.470
Dextra: Fine then.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.870
You'll duel nistro and me
together and if you beat either

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.200
one of us, then
you win the match.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470
And your friend gets
his second chance.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.200
But if you lose,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.240
then you get the exact
same punishment as him.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.040
Let's duel!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.400
Astral: Yuma!

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.640
He has begun a duel.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.970
I must go.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.300
Number 96: Leaving
so soon, Astral?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
Number 96!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.040
Did you break your seal again?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.540
We all agree that
our time has come.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.440
It is time to act,
and to destroy!

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.770
What?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.100
Subdue Utopia, dark mist!

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.140
Let's end this duel now!

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.000
Straight Slash attack!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.770

you can't protect your monster
anymore since you have no more

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.300
cards left in your hand!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.470
no more cards in my
hand, that's right!

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.940
I activate my Tasuke
Knight's special ability!

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.470
I almost forgot!

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500
When tasuke Knight is in my
graveyard and I get attacked

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.240
with no cards in my hand, I can

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.200
not only summon it, but
it also ends the battle!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.640
He blocked me?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.840
TORI: Way to think on
your feet, yuma!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.670
It's gonna take more
than that to beat me.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.440
You got lucky kid.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.740
Okay, let's see now.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.370
I have two level 4
monsters on my field,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.200
I should summon utopia.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.570
Yo, Astral!

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.870
Where are you?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.040
Hey!

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.400
Quit Stalling, yuma!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.670
it's gonna be impossible to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.200
summon utopia without
Astral around.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.440
Yuma!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.100
Seize Astral, dark mist!

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Give up.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.440
We will absorb you.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.370
Yuma!

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.540
Quickly,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.000
utopia, you must leave
me and go help yuma.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.870
Do not let it escape!

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.200
Oh no!

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.970
I'll just have to win
this without utopia.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.470
I... draw!

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.900
this card can't put a stop
to any of their monsters.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.440
Tasuke Knight, take
out morpho butterspy!

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.500
Power-Push!

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.740
That's the best
you got for us?

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.400
A mosquito could do
more damage than you!

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.240
Utopia!

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.340
Dark Mist, destroy number 39!

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.170
No!

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.200
It is getting away!

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.170
Good Luck, yuma.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.640
Stop stallin'!

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.370
end your turn so
I can crush ya!

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.940
Either that or
forfeit the duel.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.370
Okay.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.040
I'll place a card
facedown and end my...

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.370
whoa, my key!

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.070
Utopia?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.940
But since the card appeared,
shouldn't Astral be around, too?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.700
Astral, are you there?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.070
Astral?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.140
Where are you?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.300
If utopia came without Astral,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.970
then something must
be seriously wrong.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.540
Utopia got away, but
you will pay the price.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.870
Lacking utopia's protection, you
will be helpless to resist us.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.400
Your concern for humans must
have weakened your mind.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.200
Now numbers, join with me!

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.800
Absorb Astral so that we can

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.370
complete our mission
of destruction.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.500
What are you doing?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.440
All these numbers are
under my control now.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.740
But I need more power.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.040
You will be assimilated next!

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.470
If the lightshow is over
kid, let's get back to dueling!

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.440
There's something
weird going on.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.140
Be careful, nistro.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.870
I hope yuma finds a way
to flip this duel around!

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.470
Could it be,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.070
that Astral's also battling
somewhere far from here?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.570
He must've made a huge
sacrifice to send this to me.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.000
So I can't waste this chance.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.270
Now let's go,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.840
cause right now I'm
feelin' the flow!

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.470
First I'm gonna
overlay my level 4

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.970
gagaga gardna and tasuke Knight!

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.740
Then I'll use them to
build the overlay network!

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.240
I XYZ summon, number 39 utopia!

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.270
Alright!

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.170
It's a number.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.540
He has a number!

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.770
and it's one of the most
amazing I've ever seen!

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.470
It is spectacular.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.400
Okay then, we're set
to take 'em on utopia.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.800
There's no way they
can defeat us now!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.470
I'm gonna subtract
that number from his deck!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.070
Not yet, nistro.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.070
You have to wait for me.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.300
I'm summoning moonlit papillon.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.540
Don't, dextra!

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.170
I told you I'm goin'
after that number!

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.770
You'll wait your turn.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.800
Now that we know he has a number
card, this isn't a game anymore.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.770
We're doing this by
the book, understand?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.740
I hate "By the book."

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.870
I overlay my level 4 swallowtail
butterspy and moonlit papillon!

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.940
And with them I'll build the
overlay network and then XYZ

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.540
summon, photon papilloperative!

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.470
That's one
mean-looking butterfly!

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.770
Hey, wait!

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.340
They're using photon monsters,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.040
just like the
ones Kite used before!

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:19.403
How come you use photon
monsters just like Kite?

00:08:19.403 --> 00:08:21.633
What'd you say?

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.063
So...

00:08:23.063 --> 00:08:26.263
you know this Kite
Well, do you?

00:08:27.863 --> 00:08:29.963
There is no escape, Astral!

00:08:29.963 --> 00:08:32.203
You are going to
fulfill your mission.

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:34.703
Whether you like it or not.

00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:37.963
There is much we
have to destroy.

00:08:37.963 --> 00:08:39.363
I know Kite.

00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:42.963
We dueled each other a while
ago. But we finished in a draw.

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:44.663
A draw?

00:08:44.663 --> 00:08:47.303
But Kite is one of the
strongest duelists I know.

00:08:47.303 --> 00:08:49.663
You'd have to be
incredibly skilled!

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:51.903
Either that or...

00:08:51.903 --> 00:08:54.563
Mr. Heartland told us, remember?

00:08:54.563 --> 00:08:56.303
He said the original number,

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:59.033
the envoy from Astral
world came to this planet.

00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:01.033
Well I think we just found it.

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:03.463
Are you suggestin' that this
kid's playin' host to the

00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:06.063
visitor from Astral world?

00:09:06.063 --> 00:09:09.433
A twerp like him couldn't go toe
to toe against Kite unless he

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:11.433
had a major advantage.

00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:13.233
I see what you're sayin'.

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:16.303
if he has the original number,

00:09:16.303 --> 00:09:19.433
it'll make my victory
all the sweeter!

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:23.333
I'm going hunting first, nistro.

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:25.663
And I'll use photon
papilloperative's

00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:27.833
special ability!

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.533
By Using One overlay Unit, your
utopia switches from defense to

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:36.533
attack mode and loses
600 attack points!

00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:39.363
Then I'll add to your
troubles by using my

00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:42.133
spell card berserk scales!

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:44.903
It gives my photon
papilloperative a one thousand

00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:48.503
point attack boost.

00:09:48.503 --> 00:09:51.263
That monster's way
than mine stronger now!

00:09:51.263 --> 00:09:54.263
1200 attack points
to be exact yuma.

00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:57.833
Your number's safe,
but not your life points.

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:01.033
Oh man, I don't have
that many more to lose!

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.463
Ready?

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:07.333
Photon Papilloperative, attack
utopia with Vivid swarm!

00:10:12.803 --> 00:10:14.433
No!

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:17.333
I activate utopia's
special ability!

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:20.863
If I use an overlay unit,
I can negate your attack!

00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:24.763
Go Light wing shield!

00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:29.503
I didn't take any damage.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:32.203
That's right and unfortunately
for me, due to berserk scales

00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:34.033
effect, my monster photon

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:37.163
Papilloperative now
loses 2000 attack points

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:40.233
at the end of the turn.

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:43.863
But at least we now know
utopia's special ability.

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:45.233
Nistro,

00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:48.463
I'll let you take
over from here.

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:51.503
I'm fired up to win this thing!

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:54.103
I... draw!

00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:58.833
I tribute my level 4 blade
bounzer to summon level 6

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:02.963
phantom bounzer!

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:06.333
I hope he's not
gonna do what I think.

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.003
I am.

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:12.703
I overlay my level 6 phantom
bounzer and hammer bounzer!

00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:14.433
And just as you feared,

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:16.733
I'll use them to build
the overlay network!

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:20.363
I XYZ summon,
photon strike bounzer!

00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:27.733
Oh man, 2700 attack points!

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:28.903
Yeah!

00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:30.433
It's really strong!

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:33.903
Photon strike bounzer,
don't show any mercy!

00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:36.333
Go Strike streak!

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.533
Utopia, use your
special ability!

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.863
Light Wing shield!

00:11:41.863 --> 00:11:43.363
Ha, tricked ya!

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:44.733
Tricked me?

00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:47.563
Photon strike bounzer has
a special ability, too!

00:11:47.563 --> 00:11:50.733
It can use an overlay unit to
cancel out your XYZ monster's

00:11:50.733 --> 00:11:53.133
special ability,
and you get hit

00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:55.703
with one thousand
points of damage!

00:11:55.703 --> 00:11:56.933
No way!

00:11:56.933 --> 00:12:00.703
If I take that big
a hit, it's over!

00:12:07.033 --> 00:12:09.333
Yuma...

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:13.363
Got you!

00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:20.833
There is no escaping
your fate, Astral.

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:24.733
You will join with
me and become me.

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.633
Go, photon strike bounzer!

00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:32.033
Attack With Strike streak!

00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:36.333
I'm playing a trap!

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:38.133
Damage diet!

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.963
I only take half the damage
from your special ability!

00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:54.833
Yuma.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.263
Whatever!

00:12:56.263 --> 00:12:59.363
Without your light wing shield,
my monster can still attack!

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:03.133
Go on and strike it,
strike bounz

00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:09.163
he can't survive
another attack!

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:13.433
Say sayonara to the
rest of your life points!

00:13:13.433 --> 00:13:14.933
No chance!

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:17.063
I'm activating the
trap half unbreak!

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:21.363
This card can keep my
utopia from being destroyed.

00:13:24.893 --> 00:13:28.263
And I'll only take half the
damage from your attack.

00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:36.663
He's still in this thing.
But just barely.

00:13:36.663 --> 00:13:38.193
The kid is finished.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:41.333
His utopia is out of overlay
units plus he has no more

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:43.993
facedown cards.

00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:45.793
Stay down.

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:47.733
Take it easy on
yourself and hand your

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:50.193
number card over to us.

00:13:50.193 --> 00:13:53.233
Why put yourself
through any more misery?

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:58.093
I won't ever give up.

00:13:58.093 --> 00:14:00.693
Now let's get on
with the duel!

00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:02.633
Fine.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.633
If you wanna drag
out this farce,

00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:06.493
go ahead.

00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:07.933
It's my move!

00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.733
I draw!

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:13.663
I'm summoning my cardcar d!

00:14:16.993 --> 00:14:20.693
Now I can drive this card away
and two new cards will race from

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.663
my deck to replace it!

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:24.293
floor it, cardcar!

00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:27.333
Yeah!

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:31.393
to draw the card that I need,
I've gotta feel the flow!

00:14:37.033 --> 00:14:38.293
double or nothing,

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:41.133
and double tension?

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:43.763
They won't help me.

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.533
No.

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:49.063
I gotta think.

00:14:49.063 --> 00:14:50.733
There's always a way.

00:14:50.733 --> 00:14:52.633
I can still pull this off.

00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:55.133
I just have to figure out how.

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:59.563
if only Astral were here
to help me, but he's not.

00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:05.563
Hey, what's wrong?

00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:07.493
Finally.

00:15:07.493 --> 00:15:10.593
I didn't think that Twerp
would ever give up!

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:15.293
Yuma.

00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:17.033
He failed badly.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:21.363
Just as you failed, Astral!

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:29.393
Yuma...

00:15:33.893 --> 00:15:37.433
i'm sorry Astral,
i couldn't do it.

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:39.063
Don't give up, yuma!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:42.233
C'mon, you never
quit, remember?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.193
It's True!

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.333
Every time you're down or get
your deck handed to you, you're

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:49.063
so hotheaded and stubborn that
you always get back up again and

00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:52.363
keep fighting. Even when it
seems hopeless, 'cause that's

00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:54.893
just you.

00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:56.463
Tori's right.

00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:59.163
Astral is depending on me.

00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:03.563
I'll keep dueling,
and I'm gonna win, too.

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:07.393
Because I am so
feelin' the flow!

00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:20.663
Yuma.

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:21.993
I sense you.

00:16:21.993 --> 00:16:25.463
We are connecting.

00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:33.293
What is that kid doing?

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:37.093
It feels like I am
losing my hold on you!

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:40.633
That is due to the bond
between yuma and me.

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:42.663
We out-power you.

00:16:42.663 --> 00:16:46.833
Impossible!

00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:52.033
Noooooooo!

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:59.893
Yuma!

00:17:00.563 --> 00:17:02.093
It's about time!

00:17:02.093 --> 00:17:03.463
What's been keeping you?

00:17:03.463 --> 00:17:05.563
Nice to see you, as well.

00:17:05.563 --> 00:17:07.893
What is that?

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.633
What is that?

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:14.733
Astral's back!

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:16.533
Just when we needed ya!

00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:20.733
That must be the envoy who
came from Astral world.

00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:22.903
I suppose you came 'cause you
think I'm erate for your

00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:27.303
help. Well, for
your information,

00:17:27.303 --> 00:17:29.333
I was doing just
fine all by myself!

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:31.473
I don't need you making a
dramatic entrance at the last

00:17:31.473 --> 00:17:34.333
minute to tell me what to do!
So you can go back to goofin'

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:37.833
off wherever you came from
and let me handle these guys.

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:40.103
So this is a two-on-One duel.

00:17:40.103 --> 00:17:41.703
You have done Well, yuma.

00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:43.973
I sense all the pieces
are in place for victory.

00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:46.203
They are, really?

00:17:46.203 --> 00:17:47.503
We can win this...

00:17:47.503 --> 00:17:49.573
together.

00:17:49.573 --> 00:17:51.433
Yeah!

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:52.673
Alright.

00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:53.973
First, from your graveyard

00:17:53.973 --> 00:17:56.703
activate overlay
eater's special ability!

00:17:56.703 --> 00:18:01.603
You heard him overlay eater,
use your special ability now!

00:18:01.603 --> 00:18:04.033
That's the monster yuma sent to
the graveyard so he could

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:07.733
activate gagaga
gardna's special ability!

00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:11.303
By Banishing overlay eater,
I can snatch one of your XYZ

00:18:11.303 --> 00:18:15.003
monster's overlay units
and give it to utopia!

00:18:21.103 --> 00:18:25.033
And Now photon Strike bounzer
can't use its special ability!

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:26.933
Although that move was clever,

00:18:26.933 --> 00:18:28.673
it won't save you!

00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:33.703
Utopia, attack photon
papilloperative!

00:18:33.703 --> 00:18:36.133
It's not enough
damage to defeat me.

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:40.303
That's why I'm using
utopia's special ability,

00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:42.703
and stopping its attack!

00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:45.733
Wait, did you just say
"stop it's attack?"

00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:48.403
Yes, and next I activate
the spell double or nothing

00:18:48.403 --> 00:18:50.203
from my hand!

00:18:50.203 --> 00:18:53.703
Since I stopped utopia's attack,
this spell allows it to attack

00:18:53.703 --> 00:18:59.933
again. Only this time utopia's
attack points are doubled!

00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.303
They really pumped up utopia!

00:19:02.303 --> 00:19:04.973
But not by enough, Tori.

00:19:04.973 --> 00:19:06.803
Don't worry about that!

00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:09.633
I activate the double
tension spell card!

00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:12.673
It doubles the attack points of
my monster when it's attacking

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:16.533
for a second time!

00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:19.173
I think we can
start panicking now!

00:19:19.173 --> 00:19:20.573
That's for sure!

00:19:20.573 --> 00:19:21.803
Are you ready, yuma?

00:19:21.803 --> 00:19:23.003
Yeah!

00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:24.373
Attack!

00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:28.373
Go rising sun Supreme slash!

00:19:32.703 --> 00:19:35.433
I activate my
trap, bounzer guard!

00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:38.273
Now I can redirect your attack
so it attacks photon strike

00:19:38.273 --> 00:19:41.133
bounzer!

00:19:57.573 --> 00:19:58.833
You did it!

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:02.173
See, I told you
not to give up!

00:20:02.173 --> 00:20:05.033
Wow, for a minute there
I thought we were doomed!

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:08.073
But then Astral showed
up to save the day!

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:11.003
Oh Please.

00:20:11.003 --> 00:20:13.073
Why did you take
that hit for me?

00:20:13.073 --> 00:20:15.233
I dunno...

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:17.803
it just felt right.

00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:20.333
Well, if this doesn't prove that
you and Astral are a great team,

00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:21.603
nothing...

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:22.873
Yo, kid!

00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:24.273
We're gonna give your friend
here a second chance like we

00:20:24.273 --> 00:20:27.173
agreed. But I can
promise you this.

00:20:27.173 --> 00:20:30.203
If flip cheats again, we're
not going to be as forgiving!

00:20:30.203 --> 00:20:33.573
And one more thing, next time we
duel, I'm taking you and the

00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:37.633
original number down.

00:20:39.303 --> 00:20:41.333
You're on!

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:43.003
I'll duel you anytime anywhere!

00:20:43.003 --> 00:20:47.303
And Now, we've gotta go get the
jump on some more cheaters!

00:20:49.003 --> 00:20:51.703
I could've easily beaten those
bullies by myself of course, but

00:20:51.703 --> 00:20:54.573
it all worked out anyway!

00:20:55.633 --> 00:20:58.703
Boy A: There's that
little Fink flip!

00:20:58.703 --> 00:21:02.703
We want our heart pieces... now!

00:21:02.703 --> 00:21:04.073
Get back here!

00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:05.233
Don't touch my hat!

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:06.603
Dextra, I think we should keep

00:21:06.603 --> 00:21:08.773
our run-in with yuma a
secret from Mr. Heartland.

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:10.173
But why?

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:12.073
E I am going to defeat
the original number.

00:21:12.073 --> 00:21:17.003
I don't want Kite interfering.

00:21:17.003 --> 00:21:19.233
You got it.

00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:20.573
Take it easy, flip.

00:21:20.573 --> 00:21:21.673
Boy B: Bye!

00:21:21.673 --> 00:21:22.873
Boy C: See you never!

00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:24.273
Boy D: Yeah!

00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:26.973
Well, I have one piece anyway.

00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:28.703
Hey!

00:21:28.703 --> 00:21:32.133
It's gone!

00:21:32.133 --> 00:21:34.900
I'm heart broken!
