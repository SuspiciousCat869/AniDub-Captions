WEBVTT

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.372
Why did you call
us here, Vector?

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.740
You said it was urgent.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.177
This had better be
important... or else!

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.111
Get a grip, Mizar!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.880
I've got some great news.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.283
Our threesome has become
a fivesome again!

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.052
What?

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.893
Girag and Alito!

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.494
But how did you two wake up?

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.230
When you each fought in
the human world your powers

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.431
were totally depleted.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.334
You should both be in
a state of eternal stasis!

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.436
We were stirred from our
slumber once we sensed

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.640
that you losers desperately
needed help.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.040
Losers?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.909
The important thing is
that our friends are back!

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.513
Don't let meaningless squabbles
put a fly in your ointment!

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.081
Did somebody call for me?

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.718
I may be tiny, but I've
brought you guys a big scoop!

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.121
It's about the ruins
at Spartan City!

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.524
If you were planning to tell
us that a Mythyrian Number

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.325
can been found there,

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.395
we have already learned that
for ourselves, Heartland.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.196
And Yuma Tsukumo
knows it, too...

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.667
which means that he's probably
heading there even as we speak!

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.467
Yuma Tsukumo?

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:11.038
If we hurry, we can arrive
at the ruins before Yuma

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:14.641
and ambush him when he shows up!

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.876
Excellent idea!

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.244
I'll take it from here!

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.714
I have a bone to pick
with Yuma Tsukumo,

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:26.253
and it's about
to become personal!

(Astral)
According to the map,
the Number we seek is

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.825
somewhere here in the
ruins of Spartan City.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.895
I gotta tell you, these
are the newest looking ruins

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.463
we've been to yet.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.666
Hey, did you boys miss us?

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.234
To help us in our Number search,

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.268
we checked out
the local scenery.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:51.438
Now that we've explored those
fashionable clothing shops,

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:53.306
we should begin
a restaurant survey!

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.177
And then pick up some
local dance moves!
Oh, brother.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.414
I can't believe Kite
ordered me to me stay back

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:01.281
and keep an eye on the ship!

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.718
Doesn't he realize robots
need a little excitement, too?

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:11.391
When he gets back, I'm gonna
throw a techno tantrum!

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.895
Okay, seriously,
this city's huge,

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:18.031
so how will we find the
ruins we're looking for?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.535
We could ask the locals...
or buy a guide book...

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:22.936
(Yuma)
Whoa!

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.539
What's up?
Did you find where
the ruins are?

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.940

gonna believe it!

(Yuma)
Can I get an
autograph, too?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.821
Hey! Dextra and
Nistro, what's up?

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.191
That looks
like... Yuma!

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.792
So, you went pro, huh Nistro?

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.694
You've got a cool new name,
awesome threads,

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.963
and now you're
a total fan magnet!

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:30.630
I suppose.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.500
Kids are really into my whole
galactic warrior persona.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.935
But the best thing
is that I'm winning

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.237
and now have a shot
at a championship!

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:39.840
And have you become a
professional duelist,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.474
too, Dextra?
No way!

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.410
I am Nistro's manager!

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.011
(Nistro)
I know it's a big
career change,

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.614
but we decided we wanted
to give young people hope.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:50.851
I figured that by becoming
Nistromo the Star Voyager,

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.521
I could give fans a hero
they could look up to.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.157
I guess that sounds
pretty corny to you.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:00.227
Are you kidding?
I think it's fantastic!

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:02.929
Yeah!

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.531
What you're doing is important.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.467
Fans need to feel someone
is battling for them.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:12.606
I felt exactly like you do when
I dueled for my brother.

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:15.208
It's nice to know that
some people in this group

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:20.080
value their siblings.
Who do you mean?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.917
What brought you all here
to Spartan City anyway?

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:24.818
We're on a mission.

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:27.053
We're lookin' for
some ancient ruins.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.290
(Nistro)
What ruins?

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.527
Good afternoon.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.764
What can I get you?

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:39.266
Directions.

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:42.068
To some ruins in this city.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.604
(Nistro)
So, these ruins you're
looking for are

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.907
somehow connected
to your father?

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:47.540
That's right.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.243
Have you heard anything about
them from the locals here?

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:54.748
I've heard some of them
talk about a legend.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.783
It tells about
a ruined coliseum,

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.152
haunted by the spirit
of a warrior.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.655
Warrior? What else
do you know?

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:05.625
(Dextra)
According to the legend, there
was once a warrior who only

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.693
battled with his hands.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:10.697
Even so, he was the greatest
warrior in the city.

00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:13.633
His only true rival was
the prince of the city,

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.702
who was himself
a mighty warrior.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:18.505
The two battled many
times and came to respect

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:19.506
each other's skills.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:22.108
Though one was royalty
and the other a commoner,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.576
they eventually became friends.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:28.848
None of this made the prince's
advisors very happy.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.117
And so, they started
to look for some way

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.953
to get rid of the
warrior for good.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.755
During a public match, the
advisors accused the warrior

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.959
of being a traitor and
threat to the empire.

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:40.827
The warrior swore
he was innocent

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.429
and the prince defended him too.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.798
But the warrior was
found guilty.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.801
And so he was banished
from the city forever.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.404
Time passed and the great
city fell into decay.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:54.908
But legend says that even
now the spirit of the warrior

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.043
wanders the coliseum's ruins.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:00.046
His spirit's still angry
that he paid for a crime

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.749
he didn't commit.
No, you're wrong.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.885
His spirit is there because
he still wants to fight.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:09.823
The prince's advisors stopped
their match before it was done.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.291
The outcome was never decided,

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.560
so the warrior's
spirit can't rest.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.762
He still lingers at
the coliseum's ruins

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:17.897
which are now underwater.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:18.465
Wait!

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:20.767
I thought those ruins
were supposed to be

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.069
here in the city!

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.838
They are.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:28.441
The people of Spartan City were
afraid of the spirit, so they

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.610
built a huge bank
all around the ruins

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.112
and then filled it with water.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:35.148
How can we reach the Number
if it's underwater?

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:36.416
It'll be dark soon, Yuma.

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.284
Let's deal with
this tomorrow after

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.287
we get a good night's sleep.

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:46.459
Retrieving the Number down
there will not be easy.

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:53.566
It looks like they haven't
arrived at the lake yet.

00:08:55.402 --> 00:09:00.140
Which means I still
have time for a little fun.

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:03.443
You made it all
the way to the finals!

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:07.113
We're counting on you to win!

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.452
Strange, this is the first
time I've had trouble

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:14.521
sleeping before a match.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.022
It's not a good sign.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:18.491
The legend says that whoever
captures the spirit of

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:23.029
the warrior down there,
will gain extraordinary power.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.632
I can't believe I came here
in the middle of the night

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.134
because of some
moldy old legend!

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.070
Even if the story was true...

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.438
I could never reach those ruins

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:34.140
unless I had scuba gear.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.944
It's time to spring a leak!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.901
Yuma! Wake up!

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.636
What is it, Astral?

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:07.040
I have sensed a disturbance.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.109
Is there something up
at the lake?

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:13.346
It's more like
something has gone down.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.148
(Yuma)
The water
drained away!

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.217
That means we can
reach the ruins now.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:20.954
You're right.
Yeah, but so can
the Barians.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:24.691
They could reach
the Number before we do!

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.259
Shark...

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:30.597
I sense there's
a dark power down there.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:31.097
Barians...

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:34.968
(Dextra)
Why're you all
still awake?

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.837
Have you spotted something?

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:41.407
Wait, where am I?

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.744
That fall must've
rattled my brain!

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.614
This looks like the ruins
of the coliseum...

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:49.449
but that's impossible!

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:51.684
(Yuma)
Thanks for driving us in
the middle of the night.

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.187
You convinced me your
mission's important.

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.289
I just wish Nistro were here.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:11:00.793
It's not like him to
wander off this way.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:16.576
Strange...

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:22.849
I feel like I've walked
through here before.

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:30.423
That looks like...
a Number card!

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.929
That card is mine
for the taking...

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:38.298
and I'm going to take it now!

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.534
And use it against Yuma!

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.905
This barrier is strong!

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:49.509
(voice)
Only one who possesses the
spirit of a great warrior

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.679
is worthy of
inheriting my power!

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.846
Could you be the one?

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:57.417
Are you willing to prove
that you surpass all others

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:59.452
in skill and courage?

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.587
You better believe it!

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:04.290
Now give me that Number
so I can beat Yuma Tsukumo

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.760
once and for all!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.564
You cannot be him!

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.104
You're...

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.940
mine!

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:29.549
Yes! This Number is
incredibly powerful.

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:30.850
But using it will cost me.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.787
I have to be willing to
put it all on the line...

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.756
(Nistro)
Hey, Buddy!

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.959
What are you doing here?

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.594
(Alito)
His face is familiar...

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:45.598
He looks like the duelist
from the tournament!

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.700
(Yuma)
Nistro!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.504
Nistro! What're you
doing here?

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.013
Alito!

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:02.215
Long time no see!

00:13:02.215 --> 00:13:05.852
Yuma Tsukumo...

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.622
I'm glad to see
that you're okay!

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.190
I was worried about
what happened

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.759
to you after our duel.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:14.394
As you can see, I'm fine.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.596
I've completely recovered
and I can't wait to step

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.931
into the ring with you
and have a rematch!

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.734
(Alito)
This Number is eager to
go into battle with me!

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:25.805
But if I wield it myself,
the risk would be too great.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.940
Someone set off explosions here

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.343
to get rid of the water
in the lake.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:32.845
I think it may've
been this guy, Yuma!

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:33.680
(Alito)
Of course!

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.282
I can have him take
the risk for me!

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.650
You're a duelist, right?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.452
Then you'll love this card!

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:41.854
Check it out!

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:45.258
Hold on! This is
a Number card!

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:46.159
That's right!

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:51.998
And you will now use it
to defeat Yuma for me!

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.273
What're you doing?

00:14:00.273 --> 00:14:01.908
Stop! Nistro, no!

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:05.909
I must eliminate all
threats to Barian World!

00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:11.851
I must eliminate all threats
to Barian World!

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:16.456
Alito! Why have you taken
control of Nistro's mind?

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:17.557
Taken control?

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:19.278
Wait, who are you?

00:14:19.278 --> 00:14:23.145
My name's Alito and I'm one
of the seven Barian emperors!

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:23.912
You can't be a Barian!

00:14:23.912 --> 00:14:28.383
Your kind left this world
after Dr. Faker was defeated.

00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:31.153
Well now we're back and
ready for a tag duel...

00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:33.388
two of us against two of you!

00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:34.857
You expect us to fight Nistro?

00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:37.025
Winning this duel is the
only way to free him

00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.760
from Alito's mind control!

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.429
Okay, in that case then,

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:42.631
let's show this
Barian how to battle!

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:46.869
You?
I can't stand by while the
Barians turn him into a puppet.

00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:50.105
I'll fight against Nistro...
to save him!

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:53.242
Are you with me?
Yeah!

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:53.809
Hang on!

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.777
She hasn't faced Barians before!

00:14:55.777 --> 00:14:58.714
Let me duel!
No, Shark.

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:01.617
We have to let
Dextra handle this.

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:04.720
Yuma, why do you look
so down in the dumps?

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.722
You wanted to duel
me again and now

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:09.191
you're going to get the chance!

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:11.059
Yeah, that is true.

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:13.562
Our last duel was so
awesome that I was hoping

00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:16.198
we'd face-off
again someday.

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:18.200
Only I didn't think
were gonna turn

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.036
one of my friends against me!

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.638
I need Nistro's help.

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:24.773
He'll be a valuable partner.

00:15:24.773 --> 00:15:27.609
In fact, he'll give
this duel his all!

00:15:27.609 --> 00:15:28.644
What do you mean?

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.980
You'll find out...
soon!

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.352
Let's do this!
Duel Disk go!

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.122
Duel Gazer let's roll!

00:15:40.122 --> 00:15:41.189
(all)
Let's duel!

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:44.960
<i>(computer voice)</i>
Augmented Reality Vision
Link established.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.662
The Barians must prevail.

00:15:46.662 --> 00:15:48.897
I'll go first!
I draw!

00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:54.236
I summon Heroic-Challenger
Ambush Soldier!

00:15:56.438 --> 00:16:01.310
My task is done, I end my turn.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.844
Nistro...

00:16:02.844 --> 00:16:04.379
I'll go next!

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:05.881
I draw!

00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.351
(Yuma)
I can't believe Alito
brainwashed Nistro!

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:13.388
What a jerk move!

00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:14.122
Stay calm, Yuma.

00:16:14.122 --> 00:16:16.792
Giving in to anger
will not help you.

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:17.659
I know.

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:19.895
Gotta get in the zone!

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:25.200
I'll start my turn by
summoning Gagaga Magician!

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:30.739
Then I'll use a spell
card... Gagagamirror!

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:33.742
My magical mirror reflects
back Gagaga Magician,

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:37.079
creating an exact copy but
they won't be around for long

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.681
'cause I'm gonna use them
as part of a magic act

00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:42.384
and make them disappear!

00:16:42.384 --> 00:16:45.821
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:50.826
I Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:16:57.199 --> 00:17:00.669
Bringing out your best monster
right from the start?

00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:01.670
You must be worried.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.774
You're the one who should
be worried right now, Alito.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:06.441
Here!

00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:10.345
I'll put this card facedown
and end my turn!

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:12.447
All the tough talk in
the world won't save you

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:15.384
from the disaster that's
heading your way!

00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:18.520
And now, it's my turn!
I draw!

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.723
I'll put one monster
facedown in defense mode!

00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:26.294
And then I'll place a second
card facedown and end my turn!

00:17:26.294 --> 00:17:27.963
Then it's my move!

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:31.566
I draw!

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.269
I place this monster
facedown in in defense mode.

00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:41.276
Next, I'll put two more cards
facedown... ending my turn.

00:17:42.611 --> 00:17:44.012
It is my turn.

00:17:44.012 --> 00:17:44.613
I draw!

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:50.352
I summon Heroic Challenger,
Clasp Sword!

00:17:51.486 --> 00:17:55.924
Next, I activate Ambush
Soldier's special ability!

00:17:55.924 --> 00:17:58.627
And I guarantee you never
saw this coming!

00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:01.396
I can tribute this monster
and replace it with two other

00:18:01.396 --> 00:18:05.033
Heroic Challengers by lowering
their Levels to 1!

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:09.337
I summon Double Lance
and Night Watchman!

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:19.481
Now I overlay my three
Heroic Challengers!

00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:23.418
With these three monsters
I build the Overlay Network

00:18:23.418 --> 00:18:29.057
and Xyz Summon Number 54:
Lion Heart!

00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:50.812
That must be the Number
from these ruins!

00:18:50.812 --> 00:18:53.582
It doesn't seem to be
packing that much punch.

00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:54.950
Perhaps not.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.785
When Lion Heart is
in attack mode,

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:58.954
you can't destroy it in battle!

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:04.259
Go, Lion Heart!
Attack Utopia!

00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:05.794
But that makes no sense!

00:19:05.794 --> 00:19:09.898
You're setting yourself up to
take 2,400 points of damage!

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:12.901
Lion Heart's special
ability activates!

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:18.807
Now Yuma will take the same
amount of damage that I do!

00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:22.410
Yikes!
Oh, no!

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.113
Pouncing Punch!

00:19:39.227 --> 00:19:42.664
Nistro! Yuma!

00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:45.100
You intend to keep
exchanging blows

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.002
until one of you collapses!

00:19:47.002 --> 00:19:47.669
That's right.

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:50.605
Except I can pound away
without taking damage.

00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:53.441
Nistro will get
pummeled instead.

00:19:53.475 --> 00:19:55.577
As a puppet, he's very useful...

00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:57.445
and completely disposable!

00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.048
Alito, I can't believe
you're battling this way!

00:20:00.048 --> 00:20:03.718
You wouldn't have sunk this
low when we dueled before!

00:20:03.718 --> 00:20:04.786
That was then, Yuma.

00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:10.091
Now I'll do anything to make
you pay for defeating me!
