00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.260
Policeman a: We've got you
completely surrounded!

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.890
Put your hands on the
back of your head

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.760
and get down on your knees!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.390
Charlie: Not gonna say 'please?'

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.930
now that isn't very
polite of you, is it?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.960
And look at that,
you called in the birdies.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.630
I had no idea you
clowns would make such a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.730
fuss over a single card.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.630
Whoa, how's it goin' fellas?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.530
Nice touch with the
glow-Y sticks,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
but I'm pretty sure
I've got you beat.

KARI: There's a lotta buzz on
heartland's private frequency.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.990
Must be something going on.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.360
Looks like heartland museum.
Whoa, a break-in!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.090
Let's just tap into
the cameras and...

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.830
is that?...

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.430
you've gotta be kidding.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.130
Yo, Kari.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.630
guessing you've hacked in
and seen the security

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.130
footage at this point.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.490
keep in mind,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.960
the camera Adds
about ten pounds.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.560
Charlie.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.090
What have you done this time?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.060
What did you take
from the museum?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.760
Just something I needed.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490
Thing is, I gotta
deliver it today,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.160
but I'm a little pinned down.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.130
Feel like helpin'
out your old boyfriend?

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.360
Okay Charlie, one - You are
not 'my old boyfriend!'

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.460
and two - You need
to turn yourself in!

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.130
Now why would I do that?

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.430
As for 'boyfrien
not boyfriend...'

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.190
we can discuss that when you
bring me your old man's bike.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.190
just hop on and come meet me.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.130
I'll shoot you my location.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.790
Give me one good reason.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.990
uuuuh, because you like me?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.660
I'm kinda hungry too, so
maybe you could swing by a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.930
drive-Thru?

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.190
You...

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.160
you selfish, reckless doofy,
arrogant excuse for a...

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.730
I am not doofy.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.160
at least that's not
what you said

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.730
last time we saw each other.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.390
meet me in 30,
don't keep me waiting.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.990
Charlie, I'm not gonna...

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.890
that guy.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.960
"last time we saw each other."

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.590
You Sparkle like
a diamond, Kari.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.160
See you around.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.390
You're hungry, Charlie?

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.730
I'll feed you a
knuckle sandwich.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.530
Yuma: Aw yeah, I am seriously
feeling the flow today!

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530
Tori: C'mon yuma, slow down!

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.390
I gotta get one more duel in
while I'm feelin' like this!

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.530
Astral: Do not get
too relaxed, yuma.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.660
Those who remain in the carnival
do so because they are skilled.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.730
When you say 'those who remain
in the carnival', you mean like

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.530
me, right? Because...

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.560
Hey sis, what's up?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.730
what're you doing?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.060
where are you right now?

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.290
Uh, I'm near the train station.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.560
perfect.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.830
there's a guy there
in the courtyard,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.130
i'm sending you a picture now.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.330
i need you to find
him and keep him busy.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.790
I don't have time for this.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.530
I've got things to do.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.260
You find him and keep him busy.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.890
I'm doing something right now.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.730
I just need you to
buy me some time.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.030
but uh...

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.160
I was gonna go and...

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.330
do it, yuma!

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.430
Okay!

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.890
now listen up.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.390
once you see him,
corner him, capture him.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.830
do not let him
out of your sight!

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.430
Why does my sister hate me?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.960
Is this some friend of hers?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.690
I don't know.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.930
But wait,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.190
if I don't do what she says,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.930
it'll be morning noogies
for a solid month!

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.890
[cheering]

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.260
is that a duel?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.030
Shark: Next I activate
submersible CARRIER

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.060
aero shark's special ability!

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.990
Here comes - Torpedo take down!

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.360
It's shark.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.660
People: That's right!
That was awesome!

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.090
Man B: Sweet victory!

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.990
Ah wow, that was incredible!

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.460
Does This mean what
I think it means?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.730
Yuma.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.190
You're competing in the
world duel carnival!

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.590
Only for as long as I need to.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.060
What do you mean?

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.260
As soon as I do what
I gotta to do, I'm out.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.090
What are you talking about?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.030
The duelist I lost to in the
nationals is in the carnival.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.360
I'm gonna settle the score.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.590
The nationals?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.630
But I thought... you cheated and
then like you got... kicked out.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.230
There's a lot more to
that story than you know.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.390
For now,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.290
just stay out of my way.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.060
Wait up...

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.000
shark...

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.160
KITE: Go photon stream
of destruction!

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.990
Now your souls are mine!

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.790
Thank you for
your donation.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.330
Two number cards
for the price of one.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.830
Orbital 7: Great deal!

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.590
Same old shark.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.330
"I'm too cool to
give a straight answer."

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.530
Yuma, look.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.330
Earth to yuma!

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.930
Isn't that the guy?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.560
Eh, that's a lady.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.330
Sitting on the bench.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.290
Oh Yeah.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.630
Hey, you!

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.730
Kari sent me,

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.060
I'm yuma.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.660
She sent her little brother?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.890
She said to capture me?

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.590
How are you supposed
to do that?

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.060
I don't know,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.860
she knows I'm busy with
the world duel carnival.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.060
You're in the duel carnival?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.690
Then what would you say
to a duel right now?

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.090
You wanna duel?

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.260
Well the thing is, I kinda
need to test this card out.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.530
Macho: Hey!

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.830
You in the hat, I see
you're waving a card around.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.290
How about we put a
heart piece on the

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.290
line right here and right now?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.990
Well, I'm not
in the carnival,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.630
But my friend
yuma here is.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.760
Why don't we Wager
one of his pieces?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.030
My piece?

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.160
No way, man!

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.290
Relax.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.490
Seriously.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.990
With the streak of
luck I'm having,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.660
there's no way This
guy can beat me.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.290
Dr. Faker: Mr. Heartland,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.760
how is our Kite doing?

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.490
Dr. Heartland: Kite doesn't
even know what it means to lose.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.860
Excellent.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.660
And as of now, over half of
those competing in my duel

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.560
carnival have been eliminated.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.330
Many of those who remain most
Certainly possess number cards.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.930
Then everything is proceeding

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.590
exactly as we
envisioned it would.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.960
I hope you appreciate the
opportunity we have here.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.190
The envoy from Astral world came
here in order to bring us down.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.290
However, how fortunate that
upon his arrival,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.430
an accident occurred
and his 99 number cards

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.990
were scattered into the wind.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.760
That accident
bought us the time

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.130
we need to plan our
counter measures!

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.790
We must gather those cards and

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.660
prevent that envoy from
remembering what he was sent

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.290
here to do, Mr. Heartland.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.790
Do not let me down!

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.790
I won't.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.130
Unnh!

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.390
I can't believe I
let you talk me into

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.890
wagering one of
my heart pieces,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.260
this guy is mopping
the floor with you!

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.890
Don't worry, yuma.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.230
I'm not gonna lose.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.590
Glad you're confident.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.960
Maybe you didn't notice,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.160
he's got three xyz
monsters on his field.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.690
Not only that,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.930
there is a considerable
life point gap between them.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.390
You need to forfeit!

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.230
Say you gotta go, make up a
great reason, like...

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.760
aagh, I can't think of anything!

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.430
Don't get so worked up.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.860
After all, life
is just a carnival.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.290
You're supposed to have fun.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.530
"Life is... a carnival."

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.490
It's easy to have fun
when you're losing

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.960
someone else's heart piece!

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.560
Who said anything
about losing?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.790
Well, lookee at
what we have here.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.760
I am activating the
reload spell card!

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.830
This allows me to
return my hand to my deck.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.730
And then, I shuffle up and draw

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.090
a new card for every
card that I returned.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.790
Here we go!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.290
Eh?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.790
Uh-Oh,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.330
not sure that was a good idea.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.360
Of course it wasn't!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.760
It was terrible!

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.190
Just kidding.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.090
I'm activating triple ace.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.160
When I have three of the same
level 1 monster in my hand,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.390
I can use triple
ace to summon all three of them.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.560
So now I can toss Three dice
levelers onto the field!

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.630
Ooooohhh!

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.760
A hundred attack points,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.490
what, are you givin'
up or something?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.290
Actually, this is the part
where I start winning.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.690
First, I activate dice
leveler's special ability.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.260
What's he doing?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.130
Losing my heart piece.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.490
Time to test my luck.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.660
When I take a chance
and roll the dice,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.530
their levels will
increase by the number that

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.360
comes up.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.860
He rolled all sixes!

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.930
The odds of rolling
six on three dice

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.760
at the same time
are one in 216.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.130
Heh, heh.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.090
Looks like lady luck is
wanting me to power up

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.530
my dice to level 7!

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.930
And just like that,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.590
he has three level 7
monsters on his field.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.460
You've had a nice
little run my friend,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.990
But the winds of fortune
are about to change.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:07.190
I now overlay all three
of my dice levelers!

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:12.160
With these monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.430
And then,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.190
I xyz summon -
Number 7 lucky straight!

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.260
Amazing...

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.190
he's got a number.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.690
Interesting. Perhaps
this explains his luck.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.390
And now I'm activating
the dream dice spell card.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.290
It's a game of chance.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.830
I give this here dream dice a
roll, and if it comes up a six,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.690
all your monsters lose
all their attack points.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.160
But anything else,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.430
and my monster'll be the one
losing all its attack points.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.990
What?

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.630
No way, He rolled another six?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.630
Bingo!

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.530
Now your monsters are busted!

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.190
Hope you weren't fond
of those attack points.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.230
The odds of rolling that many
sixes in a row are...

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.530
1296 to one.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.890
Alright!

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.130
Do it, lucky straight!

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.090
Heh,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.790
I can 700 points of damage!

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.430
You might be taking
a lot more than that,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.730
cause I'm activating
lucky straight's special

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.130
ability!

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.430
When lucky straight battles,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.330
I can use one overlay
unit to roll the dice.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.630
And then, lucky
straight's attack points

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.230
Get multiplied by the
number that comes up.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.330
So, if luck is on my side, this
could be the end, my friend.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.530
Woooo-Hooo!

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.460
Now we just multiply
lucky straight's

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.030
700 attack points by six and
then, this one's in the books.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.190
This can't be!

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.060
the rumors about this card
were True. It's incredible.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.090
just hope the luck it brings
holds out until tomorrow,

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.130
when I really need it.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.660
That was amazing.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.030
A huge comeback in one turn.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.890
But so much of that comeback
depended on chance. Interesting.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.960
7776 to one. Those are
the odds that he was facing.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.330
You cheated, I know it!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.090
Nobody rolls that
many sixes in a row!

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.130
What is this all about?

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.790
Charlie Mccay!

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.660
You are completely surrounded!

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.390
There's no getting
away this time!

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.430
That's pretty much what they
said last time I got away.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.890
Put your hands on the
back of your head!

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.160
Whatever you say...

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.730
here's the problem
though, fellas.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.190
There's something I gotta do.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.960
I really don't have
time to hang out.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.530
It's show time.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.730
Alright people,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.860
who's up for a game of chance?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.890
[Screaming]

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.260
yuma, your number card!

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.490
-Hey!
-What's going on?

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.560
My cards!

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.460
Yuma, look up!

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.590
You might want to run.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.160
Yuma, look up!

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.590
You might want to run.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.190
-Look out!
-Run as fast as you can!

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.960
What...

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.890
what's he doing?

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.590
Everybody okay?

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.160
-We're fine, Officer.
-Yes, thank you so much.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.360
What's happening?

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.530
-How's he doing that?
-Hey, give those back!

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:00.960
This is against the law!

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.990
Good thing I was standing here,

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.430
this donut could've hurt me.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.090
Seriously, I mean talk
about close calls, right?

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.960
But hey, close calls
make life more fun.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.530
And since life is a carnival,
the more fun I have, the better.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.590
Hey yuma, when your
sister gets here,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.760
tell her I'm sorry
I had to Bolt!

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.030
Hey!

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.530
I'm not letting you
just run off with my card,

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.860
come back!

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.690
Yuma, wait!

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.890
Please tell me the
donut wasn't your fault.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.090
It wasn't.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.490
Where is he?

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.330
He's, uh... gone.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.290
So he snagged everyone's
cards and then took off?

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.590
I don't believe that guy!

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.730
And to think I actually took
some time to make him food.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.390
So do ya' think that crazy card

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.090
he dueled with is what he
stole from the museum?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.790
Sounds like it.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.830
I heard them talking about the
card on the heartland frequency

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.360
and so I did some
quick research.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.560
Everyone who's ever had that
card has been blessed with a

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.830
sudden streak of crazy luck.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.260
In the past few months,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.790
that card has turned people
into overnight celebrities and

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.230
millionaires.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.690
That's nuts.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.790
He totally acted
like he knew who I was.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.890
Who is this guy, sis?

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.930
Charlie Mccay
was dad's assistant.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.860
He helped him with his
research and went on a

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.290
few excavations with him,
and then basically

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.590
decided to become a big
block-Headed buffoon

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.360
who flies all over
the world looking for

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.430
ancient shiny things.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.660
Every time I think I'm
never gonna see him again,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.660
he has this way of showing up.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.230
Well,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.760
alright you two, you guys
up for a little recon?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.460
Yeah, we'll find this guy!

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.530
We'll turn this
whole city upside down

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.560
if that's what it takes!

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.860
TOGETHER: Let's do this!

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.230
All right, Tori.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.560
Let's start looking!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.960
Do you have any leads?

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.560
If you search randomly,
you will never find him.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.830
What do you suggest,
know-it-All?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.460
At first I was not sure why
I recognized those words,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.830
and then I realized.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.530
86th district, 7th area.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.960
I have seen those words
while riding the D line

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.030
monorail with you.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.730
They spin around at
the top of a building.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.090
I admit that this might
be what you would call

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.230
"Kind of a stretch."

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.630
But it might be worth
looking along that rail line.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.990
Perhaps if we explore the
surrounding areas, we will find

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.990
This Charlie Mccay and
retrieve your number card.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.890
What's going on?

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.560
Looks like the police are
heading toward the bay area.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.090
The d line goes through there!

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.230
It's him!

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.000
It's gotta be!

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.060
Policeman C: Lieutenant!

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.290
We've stopped the monorail

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.030
and evacuated all
passengers and personnel.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.230
The suspect is surrounded.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.160
Policeman B: Get down
on your knees, Mccay!

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.460
Man, you guys just
do not give up, do ya'?

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.430
did your bosses not
give you the memo

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.830
about what this card can do?

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.830
-Hey!
-The monorails closed!

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.830
No hard feelings boys,
but I've really

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.060
got somewhere I need to be.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.890
Helicopter pilot:
Something's wrong!

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.660
Our controls are jammed!

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.990
Police RADIO: Suspect is
on the westbound d rail,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.630
moving through the bay area!

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.960
Huh?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.290
Kari, I've got him!

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.490
We're on the d line monorail!

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.560
i'm on my way!

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.260
So you found me.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.030
Little quicker than
I thought you would.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.260
You took my card,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.760
I'd like to have it back!

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.060
Heh, heh, heh.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.290
Direct and to the point.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.790
Well as it happens, I've
jammed this monorail

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.790
so it can't be stopped
by the control center.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.890
And I'm afraid our
destination is all the way

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.890
on the other side of the
city. So uh, what do

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.890
you say we pass the time
with a little duel?

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.660
A duel?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.160
And if you manage to win, then
I'll give you your card back.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.060
Yuma, you have to retrieve
that number card.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.260
All right.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.630
Let's do it!

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.630
Duel Disk go!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.830
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.330
Computer VOICE:
Duel interface set.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.490
Augmented reality
Vision Link established.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.530
Be careful, yuma!

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.130
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.460
What's yuma doing
on top of that monorail?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.760
Is this the best
time to be doing this?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.130
This guy Took my number card and
I'm getting it back, Tori!

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.830
That's nice and all, but if this
monorail can't be stopped,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.760
then who's supposed
to hit the brakes?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.160
Who's supposed to
hit the... brakes?

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.890
Somebody help me!

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.630
Don't be scared, yuma!

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.830
Nothing bad will happen.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.690
Luck is gonna protect us.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.590
So let's get this duel started!
