Is it?

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.423
It is a field spell.

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.524
Correct.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.060
In fact, you triggered
the field spell

Sargasso the Different

You Xyz Summoned,

just as I knew you would!

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.208
Then this was planned.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.511
Due to Sargasso's effect,

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.282

you take 500 points of damage.

And there is more.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.219
When the player has an
Xyz monster on his field,

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.257
he takes 500 points of damage
every time his turn ends.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.658
That's interesting.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:15.662
Now damage isn't a risk,
it's a guarantee.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.064
I'm good with that.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:20.667
This should make things
much more fun, am I right?

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.403
This means they will all
suffer damage as well.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.138
What is the point?

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.540
Now you listen!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.608

your field spell.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.477

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:36.316
And for what you did to Ray,
I promise I'll make you pay!

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.618
Now that's a real friend.

Thanks for keeping your

Vain Betrayer.

It not only stops your attack,

but Utopia Ray V loses
all its special abilities.

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:49.195
Furthermore, all V cards

I regain 500 life
points for every one.

Five V cards were

That means I get
2,500 life points back.

Obviously Vector even planned on
regaining his lost life points.

Wait, there's more.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.429
For every V card that
was sent to the Graveyard,

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:27.500
five cards in your deck go
straight to the Graveyard, too.

-Oh no!
-Oh no!

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.269

would lose control

Utopia Ray V.
