Why, Vector...
why...

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.753
Why did you do it?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.055
No, you don't understand!

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.491

(Don Thousand)
You seem...
uneasy.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.741
Is something
troubling you, Vector?

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.676
No, nothing I can't handle.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:46.346
Let us hope not, Because
Nash draws near...

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:50.751
with his sights set
solely on vanquishing you!

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.319
I am not afraid.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.753
Good.

What is the meaning of this?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.664
Just testing the new powers I
gained from the other Emperors.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.434
I'm so strong now I won't
need you to beat Nash!

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.735
No!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.737

Nothing to do now but wait

So, there you are!

I've been waiting for you Nash!

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.765
Astral, is that the portal
to Barian world ahead?

You'll pay for the pain you
caused Marin and to Dumon.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.743
And let me guess, Nash...

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.012
You're gonna be the one
to make me pay?

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.314
Oh I'm so terrified!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.649
You should be.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.417
Please.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.352
You're out of your league.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.421
Think so?

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.656
Let's find out!

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:14.294
Temper, temper!

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.229
You have serious anger
issues don't you?

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.100
Barging in, yelling,
trying to zap me....

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.736
Seems you have a lot
of baggage to deal with.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:23.737
And I'm going to...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.542
By giving you a duel you'll
never forget, Vector!

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.509
Really?

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.577
And why is that?

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:31.745
You painting a picture?

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.580
You think this is funny?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.983
Yes, because it's hard to
take you seriously.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.322
But since you're not
amused by my razor sharp wit,

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.759
let's skip to the part
where I finish you!

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.195
No chance!

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.697
You're...
through!

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.579
(both) Let's duel!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.049
Your madness ends here.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.084
You've got that wrong!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.487
It's only just begun!

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:14.755
I draw!

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.696
I activate the spell card,
Contract with Don Thousand!

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:26.199
This card will make for a
shocking start to our duel

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.668
because it activates
by consuming 2,000

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.403
of your life points!

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.440
Think of it as the cost
of entry into my castle!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.145
If you wanna play then you
better be ready to pay.

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:43.150
Enjoy having the upper hand,
because it won't last for long!

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.754
You may change your mind after
you fulfill the contract!

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.223
(groaning)

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.761
(laughing)

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.330
Pleasure doing
business with you!

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.499
Now that the contract
has been signed,

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.636
we're both obligated
to draw one card.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.137
The terms and conditions say

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.406
we've gotta reveal
every card we draw!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.743
If it's a spell, you can't
summon a monster normally

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:11.211
'til the end of the turn.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.247
That fine print
gets ya' every time.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.715
You're up!

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:18.752
I draw!

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.757
I drew Split Defender...

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.759
It's a spell card.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.494
A spell card already?

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.763
You must have
some kind of luck...

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.031
Bad luck!

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.766
I drew a monster card!

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.101
And now I'm going to summon it!

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.737
Welcome Umbral Horror Golem!

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:38.471
Your move!

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.007
Just know... no matter
what happens next,

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.510
I'm going to win!

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.118
(Yuma)
So this is
Barian World...

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.354
Doesn't seem very happy here.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.455
An understatement.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.757
This is a place
of immense sorrow.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:01.094
Because of Don Thousand.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.697
Dumon...

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.764
Marin...

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:07.334
I will avenge your defeat...

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:09.536
I swear it...

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.041
Chaos Draw!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.744
Don't forget about
Don Thousand's Contract!

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:21.248
You have to show me
the card you drew.

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:23.149
It's a spell card.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.685
No monsters for you yet again!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:29.222
Now show me the card
that ruined your turn.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.757
I'd be happy to.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:35.028
It's Rank-Up-Magic
The Seventh One.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.062
Not that card!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.664
Yes, Vector, that card!

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:42.335
Now I can steer clear of your
Contract and summon my Number!

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:49.309
Take to the skies Number 101:
Silent Honor Ark!

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:58.551
Then The Seventh One ranks up my
Number into a Chaos Xyz Number!

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.224
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:08.762
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:16.303
Feast your eyes on Chaos Number
101: Silent Honor Dark!

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.241
Hah!

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.742
If you think your Chaos
Number worries me,

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.745
then you are in for
a profound disappointment!

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:29.316
That's because no matter how
powerful your monster is,

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.519
my Umbral Horror Golem
can negate its attack,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.287
so you can't attack me!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:34.754
Doesn't matter.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:38.124
That won't stop
Silent Honor Dark!

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.259
It won't?

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.695
I activate its special ability!

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.764
Silent Honor Dark absorbs
one of your monsters

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:48.301
and turns it into
a Chaos Overlay Unit!

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.337
Dark Meta Crest!

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.006
Now your field is wide open.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:56.476
Nothing can stop
my monster's onslaught!

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:56.842
Wha...?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:02.682
Silent Honor Dark blast Vector
with everything you've got!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.620
(screaming)

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.792
Do you see that?

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.293
What is it?

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.295
Let's find out!

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.100
That's not all
you can take, is it?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.202
'Cause I'm just
getting warmed up!

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.773
Get up, Vector so I
can knock you back down!

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.776
2,800 points of damage!

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:30.643
That's right!

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:31.778
What do you think of that?

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.781
That I should "thank you" Nash.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.082
Huh?

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:36.783
You hapless fool!

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:40.186
I paid attention when
you dueled Quattro, you know.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.055
As a result, I'm quite familiar

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:45.191
with the power of
Chaos Number 101,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.293
as well as your strategies.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.561
I knew it wouldn't take long

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.363
for you to play your
strongest monster,

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:55.268
Silent Honor Dark, and hit
me with everything you've got!

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.736
So I set a trap.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:01.441
I can activate Chaos Rising when
I take at least 2,000 points

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.609
of damage from a Chaos Number.

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:08.147
Which I did thanks to
Silent Honor Dark's attack.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.782
What?

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:12.785
A little advice from one
Emperor to another, Nash.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.520
Try to be less predictable...

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.622
'Cause thanks to
your obvious tactics,

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.790
I read you like a book

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.793
and now I get to summon
one random Chaos Number!

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:26.666
Allow me to present Chaos
Number 65 King Overfiend!

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.237
(Nash)
Vector was willing
to take all that damage

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.139
to summon one Chaos Number?

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.207
Something's not right.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:38.277
I'm not sure what he's up to,
but I better figure it out,

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.779
fast.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.216
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:48.221
Aw, Nash, if only you knew how
important this next draw is.

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:49.789
What do you mean by that?

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:52.425
You'll learn soon enough!

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.760
I draw!

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.463
Well, look at that.

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:58.798
I drew a spell card.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:02.535
And it happens to be
the exact spell I needed!

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:05.271
I activate Chaos Caller!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.540
You could say I'm ripping
up the Contract

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.309
because I'm sending
it to the graveyard!

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.781
This allows me to summon three
powerful Chaos Numbers

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.784
by negating their
special abilities!

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.687
Let the party begin!

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:22.788
No way...

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:29.495
First to arrive is Chaos Number
104: Umbral Horror Masquerade!

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:36.035
Our next guest is a
brand new friend of mine:

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:38.771
Chaos Number 102!

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.041
No!
That's Dumon's!

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.075
That's right!

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.044
Or rather it was!

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.747
Archfiend Seraph!

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.783
And last but
certainly not least,

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.786
someone else I think you know!

00:10:54.787 --> 00:11:01.561
Arriving in style, please
welcome Chaos Number 103:

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.663
Ragnafinity!

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.769
That was Marin's Number.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:13.439
Since you were so very fond
of Marin and Dumon,

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.574
I thought it'd be fitting

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.376
that I use their
Chaos Numbers to win!

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:20.780
You could say they helped
me finish you off!

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.788
Aww, You look upset Nash.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.156
What's wrong?

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.291
Has the sight of your
dear friends' Numbers

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:36.028
standing on my field left
you speechless?

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.767
That's okay,
I'll do the talking!

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:42.702
I took them all!

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:48.374
Alito, Girag, Dumon, even
your little sister, Marin!

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.109
That just leaves you!

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:51.644
You're alone, Nash!

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.145
You're all alone...

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.248
(Yuma) No, he's not!

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:57.650
It seems some unwanted
guests have decided

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.786
to rear their
ugly little heads.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:07.260
Shark...

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.494
What's going on?

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.197
Well, isn't this
just delightful, Nash?

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.799
In your darkest hour,
your little buddies

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.768
have shown up to cheer you on.

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:19.772
Yuma and Astral
are not my friends!

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.140
Say what?

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.275
Aww, Yuma...

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.543
Rejection hurts, I know.

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:25.678
Be quiet, Vector.

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.414
Don't take it personally
that Nash is grouchy.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.782
Look, he's had a rough day!

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.617
But I don't want you
feeling left out,

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:34.253
so after I've dealt
with Nash, you're next!

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.723
There's not going to be
a 'next' for you, Vector.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:38.324
Why?

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.293
Do you plan to stop me?

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:41.260
Impossible!

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:47.466
I possess the combined power of
all the fallen Barian Emperors!

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.772
You stand no chance against me!

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.641
Dumon!

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.709
Marin!

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:59.111
Come to me!

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.784
This feeling...

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.652
It's glorious!

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:09.021
Glorious!

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.795
Whoa, Vector's power
is off the charts!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.096
Incredible!

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:20.266
It is beyond anything
I have ever felt before!

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:24.570
Unending strength courses
through every atom of my being!

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.406
It wouldn't have been possible
without the help

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.208
of your friends...

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:32.078
And your sister...

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.780
You're seething
with rage yet again!

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.084
Just like the last time
we were here.

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:39.185
Remember?

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:41.153
What do you mean, "last time"?

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:44.790
I guess I'm not surprised
you don't recognize this place.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.625
It does look a bit different...

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:51.263
Nevertheless, you blew me away
at these very labyrinth ruins.

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:54.800
I barely escaped in one piece
and was forced to retreat

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.671
back to my kingdom
like a panting dog.

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:05.644
But it wasn't enough that you'd
put an end to my conquests.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:08.781
You pursued me here with
the single minded objective

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.783
of stopping me for good.

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.518
Yes...

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.120
I do remember...

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.523
I banished countless
people, remember that?

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.258
How can he be so horrible?

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.761
It seems his cruelty
knows no bounds.

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.429
There is no doubt in my mind...

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:26.799
Vector is the deepest
depth of pure evil.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.402
You're the lowest
kind of low, Vector.

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:32.371
But Nash, you don't even
know the full story.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.374
There's much more to
me than meets the eye.

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:37.876
Oh, man!

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:40.712
You mean he's done
even worse stuff than that?

00:14:40.712 --> 00:14:41.613
As legend tells it,

00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:44.416
the mad prince exiled
his entire kingdom...

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:48.487
After that, he was the only
one left in the palace...

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:53.826
I vanquished every last soul
who dared to stand in my way...

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.194
I was invincible.

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:59.765
That is... until
the day I lost to you...

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:00.766
Nash.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:04.736
You defeated me again, right
here in my own palace.

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:07.806
That part was
especially humiliating.

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.708
But mark my words....

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.144
History will not repeat itself.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:15.514
I'm going to crush you, Nash...

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:18.617
Your story will end here!

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.359
(Vector) Any last words, Nash?

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:30.195
Yeah...
You're going to lose!

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.663
You have it backwards!

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.465
I will destroy you!

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:37.803
Horror Masquerade
attack Silent Honor!

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:44.276
I activate Silent Honor Dark's
special ability!

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:47.779
If it has a Chaos Overlay
Unit when it's destroyed,

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.282
it can resurrect
from the graveyard!

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.652
Return from Oblivion!

00:15:56.054 --> 00:15:57.189
And that's not all!

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:02.494
I also regain life points equal
to Silent Honor's attack points!

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:08.267
Not bad!

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.502
But I'm just getting started.

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:14.072
It's Archfiend Seraph's
turn to attack!

00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:33.825
Since Silent Honor has
no Chaos Overlay Units left,

00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.460
it's down for the count,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.163
so it's the perfect
time for Ragnafinity

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.165
to attack you directly!

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.807
(screaming)

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.109
Oh, no!

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:58.417
I hope you enjoy being pummeled
by your sister's monster!

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.752
I'm sure you'll
relish a direct attack

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:04.423
from my King Overfiend
just as much!

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.827
(groaning)

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:14.166
Shark...

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.468
He's hanging on
by 100 life points.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.538
I'm relieved you still have
a bit of energy left.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.140
I didn't want our
duel to end just yet.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.644
I'm enjoying making you suffer.

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:29.381
I've got much more planned
for you, but for now,

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.316
make your move.

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:33.819
This isn't over, Vector....

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:36.521
I draw!

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:40.826
I activate Split Defender!

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.829
When there's no
monster on my field,

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.831
Split Defender allows
me to seize control

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:49.534
of the monster on your field
with the most defense points!

00:17:49.534 --> 00:17:50.802
But if you have two monsters

00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:52.804
with the same amount
of defense points,

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:56.475
then you get to choose
which one I gain control of.

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.144
The monsters on your field
with the most defense points

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:02.814
are Ragnafinity
and Archfiend Seraph...

00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:05.617
Which is it gonna be, Vector?

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:08.353
I'm very sorry to
disappoint you Nash,

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.789
but I'm afraid you
will get neither,

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:14.359
because I activate
my trap card, Guard Off!

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:19.431
This card robs every monster on
the field of its defense points.

00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:23.802
And then, for every monster I
have with zero defense points,

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:27.806
you get hit with 400 points
of damage!

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:28.507
(gasps)

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:31.143
Oh, no!
That's 1,600 points of damage!

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:33.478
He will not survive this...

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.518
Goodbye, Nash!

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.753
You will not be missed!

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.524
C'mon Shark!

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:50.796
I activate
the trap Xyz Charge Up!

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.832
With it, I take no damage!

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:57.269
There you go!

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.105
You foolishly thought you
had me all figured out,

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.473
isn't that right, Vector?

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.076
The fact is I am one
hundred steps ahead

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.411
biding my time
until you catch up!

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:11.149
And with Split Defender, I get
control of one of your monsters!

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.819
With Guard Off in play, every
monster on your field

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.221
has the same
amount of defense points.

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:19.491
Which one are you
handing over, Vector?

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.828
King Overfiend.

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.832
It's no big loss...

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:31.803
You can't do much with
only 1,600 attack points!

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.339
Actually, that's plenty.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:34.706
What?

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:37.776
Thanks to Xyz Charge Up's
additional effect!

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.278
By sending this
card to the graveyard,

00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:42.214
King Overfiend gains
attack points

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:45.817
equal to the amount of
damage I would have taken!

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.288
Uh-oh.

00:19:50.288 --> 00:19:51.356
Aw, yeah!

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.824
Now King Overfiend is stronger

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.127
than every one
of Vector's monsters!

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:59.831
King Overfiend,
attack Masquerade!

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.479
(Vector)
This...
What is this?

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.581
I feel so strange...

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.251
Whoa...

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.218
What's that light mean, Astral?

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:23.455
Nash destroyed the Number that
Don Thousand gave to Vector.

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:27.559
Now Vector will regain
the true memories of his past!

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:32.831
That'll change things.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.833
I just wonder if
it'll be for the better,

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:38.336
or for the much, much worse?
