WEBVTT

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.530
Astral: Yuma, are you
sure this a good idea?

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.130
Trey is convinced that you
stand in the way of his family's

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.600
plans. That belief will make
him quite difficult to defeat.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.030
Yuma: I know that!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.130
But I also know he's
better than he pretends to be.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700
That's why I have to duel him.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.330
The only way I can
really learn what's in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.100
Trey's heart is to accept
his challenge. That's a fact.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.130
Indeed. I concede your point.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.030
On the other hand,
you have only collected

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.130
four heart pieces so far.
You will not advance in the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.670
tournament unless
you win this duel.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.300
Tori: Yuma!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.300
Hey, guys!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.870
You came for the duel?

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.470
Bronk: We wouldn't miss it.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.530
Cathy: That's right.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.600
There's a lot
riding on this matchup.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.900
Flip: Yeah, we'll have to
cheer you on to victory!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.570
CASWELL: Or offer OUR
friendly support when you

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.430
go down in flames.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
You guys really think
I could lose tonight, don't ya?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.570
It was a joke! We all
have confidence in you.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.700
We know you'll
win... for sure!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Trey May have lots
of cool cards,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
and some tricky moves,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.730
but in our book,
you're numero uno!

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.030
I agree.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.670
That goes for me too.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.070
Thanks guys.
I will win this thing!

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.170
Hooray!

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.830
Now Let's go!

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.830
Last one there's
a broken litter-Bot!

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.070
Vetrix: What's wrong,
Quinton? You seem worried.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.270
Quinton: That envoy
from ASTRAL World May be

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.100
more powerful than you realize.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
Don't trouble yourself.
Trey's triumph is assured.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.870
[laughing]

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.630
the procedure
was grueling,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.770
but Trey's power has
increased significantly.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070
But will it be
enough to defeat yuma?

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.070

I hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.970
You'll wish you
never came here at all once

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.830
you see the new
power that I've acquired.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.700
You worked out at the gym?

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.400
He means new abilities.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000
Meeting your family and seeing
you together made me think...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.030
About my own family.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.970
I want to see them all
happy like they used to be.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.430
But I can't help them as long
as you're standing in my way!

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.430
Can't you see that all I
wanna do is just help you?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.900
That's why I'm dueling!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.570
It will help us
become Real friends who

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.900
respect and trust each other.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.770
I know that can happen.
If it weren't for dueling,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.270
I wouldn't have made
friends with all of these guys!

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.830
And Trey... I'm sure
the same thing is gonna

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.500
happen after we have
our duel. You ready?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.870
Yes. But I promise you...
we'll never be friends!

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.700
Duel Disk... go!

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.700
Duel gazer Let's roll!

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.670
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.730
Let's duel!

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
Let's duel!

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:48.233
I'm drawing first, yuma.
And I won't show any mercy!

00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:58.033
first I'll see if the powers I
received from vetrix pay off...

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:02.233
it's incredible!
i can see astral clearly!

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:05.033
he must be helping
yuma during his duels.

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:06.663
but that won't be
enough to keep yuma

00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:10.463
from losing this time.

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:14.463
I activate a field spell...
Chronomaly city babylon!

00:05:22.003 --> 00:05:26.003
Where are we?

00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:35.603
Amazing.

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:37.003
Yes it is.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.533
And what's even more amazing...

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:43.133
is now I get to summon this...
Chronomaly Tula guardian!

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:46.463
I'm free to summon this card
when my babylon Field is active!

00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:48.463
It gives me a
gigantic advantage!

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:55.403
And to add to your troubles, I'm
summoning chronomaly golden jet!

00:05:55.403 --> 00:05:58.603
I activate golden
jet's special ability.

00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:02.633
Once per turn, I
can increase its level.

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:06.563
Yuma! Get ready...

00:06:06.563 --> 00:06:13.703
I overlay my level 5
golden jet and Tula guardian!

00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:17.233
With These two monsters I build
the overlay network and Xyz

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:21.233
summon NUMBER 33:
Chronomaly machu mech!

00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:33.303
Whoa! Didn't take him
long to bring a number out!

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:37.863
I play a facedown
and end my turn!

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:39.633
Your skills are no
match for my new power

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.533
yuma, I will out-Duel you!

00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:45.133
If you think this duel is just
about winning... then you don't

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.603
understand anything!
Dueling is more than that.

00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:51.863
It's about trying your
best and high-Fiving the sky!

00:06:51.863 --> 00:06:54.433
Sorry, yuma.

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:57.963
But you've high-Fived
the sky for the last time.

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:00.403
I don't think so!

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:03.363
I'm just getting started, Trey!

00:07:03.363 --> 00:07:05.103
All right, my move.

00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:08.703
Hold back, yuma.
Remember Trey has machu mech

00:07:08.703 --> 00:07:13.933
on his field. You
must focus on defense.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:17.063
I sense that he is determined
to prevail in this duel no

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.103
matter what the
cost. Be careful.

00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:23.163
Attacking Trey Recklessly
may cost you the duel.

00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:27.203
Fine! Then I'll play it safe!

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:30.633
I guess this monster
will do the trick.

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:34.133
I'll also play a
facedown and end my turn.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.033
My draw!

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.233
And I'll kick
things off by Activating

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:44.603
my palenque Sarcophagus spell!

00:07:44.603 --> 00:07:48.463
I can use this whenever I have
a chronomaly card on my field.

00:07:48.463 --> 00:07:51.963
It permits me to take
two more cards from my deck!

00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:54.733
And on top of that,
there's a specific monster

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:58.833
I can summon from my hand
whenever I activate a spell!

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.533
Meet the mighty
ancient warrior...

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:05.533
Chronomaly aztec Mask golem!

00:08:09.663 --> 00:08:11.233
I saw that before...

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:14.163
Sorry for geeking out, but
this collection is incredible!

00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:16.963
It's just like the
stuff in my favorite cards!

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:18.433
Look!

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:21.703
Isn't that an aztec Mask golem?

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:26.633
Aztec Mask golem, attack!
Show me what yuma's hiding.

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:30.633
Palenque power pummel!

00:08:37.063 --> 00:08:39.933
I knew it. It's gogogo golem.

00:08:39.933 --> 00:08:43.563
With only 1500 attack points,
Trey's attack has failed.

00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:47.563
Gogogo won't get a scratch!

00:08:50.933 --> 00:08:52.163
Good work.

00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:53.903
Because your golem is
in defense mode, it is

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:56.633
indestructible once every turn.

00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:00.803
Which means gogogo is safe even
if Trey attacks with machu mech!

00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:03.663
But I'm not out
to get your monster.

00:09:03.663 --> 00:09:05.663
I've got something
very special planned

00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:09.663
with my chronomaly
Cabrera catapult.

00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:17.733
He summoned a monster
with zero attack points!

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:21.763
But it has quite the
POWERFUL special ability.

00:09:21.763 --> 00:09:24.063
By getting rid of
one monster on my field,

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.103
Cabrera can then
chain up one of your

00:09:26.103 --> 00:09:30.833
monsters and wipe out their
attack points for this turn.

00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:32.463
Not cool!

00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:36.803
Wrap up gogogo golem!

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:47.833
Gogogo's helpless!

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.803
It also leaves you vulnerable.

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:52.933
Now I'll activate machu
mech's special ability!

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:55.563
When a monster's attack points
are changed, machu mech can use

00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:59.063
an OVERLAY unit once per
turn to deal damage to you!

00:09:59.063 --> 00:10:01.263
And that's gonna be a
big deal 'cause the damage

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:04.063
equals the tot
change in attack points.

00:10:04.063 --> 00:10:07.163
Say goodbye to 1800
of your life points yuma!

00:10:07.163 --> 00:10:09.833
Machu mech, take aim and fire!

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.833
Go infinity Cannon!

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:23.833
Go infinity Cannon!

00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:31.663
Now that Cabrera
catapult has done its work,

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.963
it switches to defense mode.

00:10:33.963 --> 00:10:36.533
I'm gonna keep This
up till you're beaten.

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:38.533
Yuma's in big trouble!

00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:41.263
I'll come back. Just watch me.

00:10:49.063 --> 00:10:50.363
Trey has changed.

00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:52.703
He's dueling differently
than he did in our last duel.

00:10:52.703 --> 00:10:53.603
But how?

00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:56.433
Remember, there are ways

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:57.333
of defeating any
strategy, even Trey's.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:11:00.263
Look, I don't want any advice!

00:11:00.263 --> 00:11:01.733
This time...

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:03.803
I've gotta win
the duel on my own.

00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:05.403
But yuma...

00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:07.963
it's my turn! Here I go!

00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:11.963
I summon gagaga magician!

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:16.703
Arm it with an equip spell, now!

00:11:16.703 --> 00:11:18.633
Astral, keep your lip zipped!

00:11:18.633 --> 00:11:22.633
I activate my bound Wand spell!

00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:27.133
Yuma...

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:29.533
remember that once
each turn you can modify

00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:31.463
gagaga magician's level!

00:11:31.463 --> 00:11:32.833
I know!

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:34.563
It's not like I
started dueling yesterday!

00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:38.863
I'm changing gagaga
magician's level to eight!

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:40.463
Excellent!

00:11:40.463 --> 00:11:42.803
Now I'll activate
bound wand's effect!

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.633
Time to make some magic.

00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:47.003
Since gagaga's a
spellcaster, it increases its

00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:50.903
attack points by its
level times a hundred!

00:11:50.903 --> 00:11:52.403
Hold on...

00:11:52.403 --> 00:11:54.933
what happens if he uses
machu mech's special ability?

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:58.333
Not that you need my advice,
but Trey would Avoid using his

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.463
monster's last overlay unit.

00:12:00.463 --> 00:12:02.463
The effect would
do little damage.

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:03.763
Good news!

00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:06.103
Gagaga... Smash
up that Cabrera catapult!

00:12:06.103 --> 00:12:09.633
I saw this attack coming.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:13.033
Too bad for you I had
a card ready to block it.

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:14.603
A trap!

00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:17.603
Stone Bola not only negates
This attack... but it'll keep

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:19.833
your magician from
attacking on your

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:25.003
next turn too.

00:12:25.003 --> 00:12:26.963
I can't believe it!

00:12:26.963 --> 00:12:29.163
you can't stop me, astral!

00:12:29.163 --> 00:12:30.963
Yuma, put a card facedown.

00:12:30.963 --> 00:12:32.833
Be quiet!

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.103
I'm doing this my way!

00:12:35.103 --> 00:12:38.363
And my way is to put a card
facedown and end my turn!

00:12:38.363 --> 00:12:39.833
What a waste of time!

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.833
Now your monster's level returns
to normal and it loses the extra

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:45.333
attack points from
your wand's effect.

00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:46.733
All that work for nothing!

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.333
It's my move!

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:50.003
I draw!

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:53.433
And now I activate the effect
of my chronomaly City babylon

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:56.163
field spell. Once
per turn, I can banish one

00:12:56.163 --> 00:12:59.133
chronomaly monster from my
graveyard... and that lets me

00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:01.333
summon another
Chronomaly monster from my

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:03.763
graveyard that's the same level.

00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:05.403
So by Banishing golden jet.

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:09.403
Now... I can bring my
aztec Mask golem back!

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:19.203
next I'll switch
Cabrera catapult into attack

00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:23.333
MODE again so I can arm
it with aztec Mask golem.

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.003
That's sick.

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:28.303
Trey, I can't believe you're
treating your monsters that way.

00:13:28.303 --> 00:13:29.663
Well believe it!

00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:30.903
These monsters of
mine are nothing more

00:13:30.903 --> 00:13:32.503
than a means to an end.

00:13:32.503 --> 00:13:35.063
You told me once that
you liked chronomaly cards.

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:36.963
What happened?

00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:38.903
You happened, yuma!

00:13:38.903 --> 00:13:41.903
Because of you my
monsters now have to suffer!

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:43.503
But Trey...

00:13:43.503 --> 00:13:46.233
I'm using my
Cabrera Catapult's ability!

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.433
Again?

00:13:48.433 --> 00:13:50.003
If he does another combo With
machu Mech's special ability...

00:13:50.303 --> 00:13:52.633
Yuma will be in
big-Time trouble!

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:55.533
When it's over, he'll only have
three hundred life points left.

00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:57.833
Then Trey just has to
attack with machu mech

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:03.533
to finish yuma off.
He doesn't stand a chance!

00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:06.433
At last, the moment I
have been waiting for!

00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:08.763
Use gagagarush, do it now!

00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:10.033
Okay!

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.403
I play the trap...

00:14:11.403 --> 00:14:14.833
gagagarush!

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:17.403
Since you targeted my
gagaga magician, this trap

00:14:17.403 --> 00:14:22.503
negates your monster's
special ability and destroys it!

00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:24.533
Next the trap checks
the attack and defense

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:27.363
points of your monster...
and whichever one of them is

00:14:27.363 --> 00:14:30.733
higher... that amount comes
right back at you as damage!

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:32.403
As damage?

00:14:32.403 --> 00:14:35.103
Since your catapult
has 1800 defense points,

00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.533
you'll get hit with
the exact same amount!

00:14:44.063 --> 00:14:45.433
Way to go!

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:49.933
I knew you'd do it,
'cause I'm your biggest fa

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:51.833
that was perfect!

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.863
Hey... How'd you know we should
be ready to spring that trap?

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:56.663
Trey is so obsessed with winning

00:14:56.663 --> 00:15:00.303
it has blinded his judgment.
He cannot fool me.

00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:04.503
He is predictable unlike you
who can never follow a strategy.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:08.003
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:09.403
We can win this...

00:15:09.403 --> 00:15:11.233
right now!

00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:12.403
Okay.

00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:14.333
but I want more than that.

00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:16.463
astral...

00:15:16.463 --> 00:15:19.033
i Wanna help Trey So he can
duel like his True self again!

00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:21.203
The combination of
yuma's dueling skills

00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.533
and astral's
strategic abilities...

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:27.033
is too great even
for my new power to overcome.

00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:30.963
Listen Trey... why do you
keep sacrificing your monsters?

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.963
It isn't your style of dueling!

00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:35.163
Am I right?

00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:37.733
I don't know anything about
the new power that you got,

00:15:37.733 --> 00:15:40.803
but you should
duel your own way!

00:15:40.803 --> 00:15:42.433
You'll never understand.

00:15:42.433 --> 00:15:46.333
When my family was torn
apart I was completely alone.

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:49.963
Without my father and
brothers I felt lost.

00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:51.703
But when I did get
them back, everything

00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:53.803
had changed for the worse.

00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:56.063
What happened to them?

00:15:56.063 --> 00:15:57.863
Why should you care?

00:15:57.863 --> 00:16:00.403
Anyway my family
is all that I have got.

00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:05.933
I won't let them down!

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:07.563
What's wrong?

00:16:07.563 --> 00:16:09.133
Nothing!

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:12.763
I'm just trying my new Power on
for size, so I can destroy you!

00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:22.963
Yuma!

00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:33.463
My golden key! What's going on?

00:16:43.834 --> 00:16:46.864
Having a deck full of powerful
number cards won't be enough to

00:16:46.864 --> 00:16:49.404
defeat this tsukumo kid.

00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:53.934
Yuma's father was the great
adventurer kazuma tsukumo,

00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:57.034
it would be unwise to
underestimate his son

00:16:57.034 --> 00:16:59.264
But the crest given to
Trey will rob yuma

00:16:59.264 --> 00:17:02.204
of everything he
inherited from his father.

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:05.204
Yuma will sink into
despair and never recover.

00:17:05.204 --> 00:17:09.234
Then he'll no longer
threaten our plans...

00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:12.704
i'm feelin' the flow!

00:17:12.704 --> 00:17:15.164
i'm feelin' the...

00:17:15.164 --> 00:17:17.404
i'm feelin...

00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:21.104
i'm...

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:26.834
wait... what was I saying?

00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:30.434
i can't... remember...

00:17:30.434 --> 00:17:35.434
it feels like I'm forgetting
something really important...

00:17:35.434 --> 00:17:38.434
but... what is it?

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:50.133
Kazuma: What's wrong, yuma?

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:52.333
You didn't look
down, now, did you?

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:53.693
Young yuma: I can't do it!

00:17:53.693 --> 00:17:55.363
I can't go any further!

00:17:55.363 --> 00:17:58.163
Whaddya saying,
we're almost there!

00:17:58.163 --> 00:18:00.863
But I'm, I'm scared...

00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:03.493
Come on yuma, feel the flow!

00:18:03.493 --> 00:18:06.093
Huh? What did
you say to me, dad?

00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:08.493
Please I couldn't
understand you!

00:18:08.493 --> 00:18:09.893
Just feel the flow!

00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:12.693
Dad, please!

00:18:12.693 --> 00:18:14.393
I need you!

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:18.263
Help me pleaseeeee!

00:18:22.993 --> 00:18:24.763
There's no way.

00:18:24.763 --> 00:18:29.763
I can't do it.

00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:31.633
Hey, yuma!

00:18:31.633 --> 00:18:34.193
Don't you wanna
try a high dive, too?

00:18:34.193 --> 00:18:35.793
I can't.

00:18:35.793 --> 00:18:39.133
I'm too scared.

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:41.493
It's just I have
this thing about heights.

00:18:41.493 --> 00:18:43.493
If you give it a try,
maybe you'll see it's

00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:45.593
not as scary as you think.

00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:46.863
I won't dive.

00:18:46.863 --> 00:18:48.693
I'm not going to do it.

00:18:48.693 --> 00:18:49.963
It's impossible, Tori.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.763
Impossible!

00:18:54.493 --> 00:18:56.993
A perfect sweep! That was easy!

00:18:56.993 --> 00:18:59.793
Nice Goin'!
it wasn't even close!

00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:02.093
Hey, I don't get it,
yuma. Why did you get so

00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:05.593
freaked out by this harmless
little equip spell card?

00:19:05.593 --> 00:19:08.063
That was the sorriest
excuse for a duel ever.

00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:11.393
In the end yuma!
That was just embarrassing!

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:13.833
Some Duelists
never know when to quit...

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:15.463
but you never even started.

00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:20.333
Let's go find a real
duelist... who tries!

00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:21.793
I can't...

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:25.793
I can't duel!

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:28.363
Sorry!

00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:29.633
My fault!

00:19:29.633 --> 00:19:31.233
I apologize!

00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:33.563
Everyone who looks at
me... thinks I'm a loser.

00:19:33.563 --> 00:19:35.233
Student B: Yuma's a reject!

00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:38.393
Student C: Don't go near him or
you could turn into a chicken!

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:39.833
Student D: He's so pathetic!

00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:41.663
Loser! Loser!

00:19:41.663 --> 00:19:43.463
Why am I so scared?

00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:50.263
I feel like I'm
missing something!

00:19:50.263 --> 00:19:52.893
Whatever it
was is gone for good.

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:56.893
I lost it forever...

00:20:00.363 --> 00:20:02.793
yuma, what is wrong? Tell me.

00:20:02.793 --> 00:20:05.563
I'm scared. What if... I lose?

00:20:05.563 --> 00:20:07.063
Maybe I should just give up.

00:20:07.063 --> 00:20:08.333
What has happened to you?

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.763
I can't win this.

00:20:09.763 --> 00:20:12.163
It's totally impossible!

00:20:12.163 --> 00:20:14.993
Trey used that
crest to change yuma!

00:20:14.993 --> 00:20:17.663
His unstoppable
spirit no longer exists!

00:20:17.663 --> 00:20:20.493
And what's more...
yuma cannot see you!

00:20:20.493 --> 00:20:21.733
Oh no!

00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:23.793
Yuma, you must not
give in to fear or doubt!

00:20:23.793 --> 00:20:27.533
Listen!

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:28.933
It's too late!

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:32.333
You can't help him anymore!

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:36.133
What now?

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:39.293
I'm removing you from
the equation, astral.

00:20:39.293 --> 00:20:42.893
This crest gives me the
ability to immobilize you.

00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:47.893
You're through!

00:20:56.063 --> 00:20:57.893
All that yuma learned
from his father has been

00:20:57.893 --> 00:20:59.733
wiped from
his memory. You are no

00:20:59.733 --> 00:21:02.133
longer able to feel the
flow... And you can no

00:21:02.133 --> 00:21:04.633
longer see astral
or the golden key.

00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:07.293
In other words,
you're harmless to me!

00:21:07.293 --> 00:21:09.093
Now, machu mech!

00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:13.093
Destroy Gagaga magician!

00:21:17.793 --> 00:21:21.793
Oh no! Yuma!

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.863
Yuma... Please hear me!

00:21:26.863 --> 00:21:28.193
It's done.

00:21:28.193 --> 00:21:31.693
I've separated yuma
and astral for good.

00:21:31.693 --> 00:21:34.693
[eerie laughing]
