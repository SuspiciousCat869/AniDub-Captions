WEBVTT

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.590
Man: I overlay three
level 2 giant germs!

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.060
And these germs are
gonna make you feel sick

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.060
cause now I can build
the overlay network!

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.530
BRONK: He's gonna xyz
summon with them!

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.190
Now Appear,
number 96: Dark mist!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.860
It only has a hundred
attack points?

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.890
TORI: Is that right?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.290
He's so big!

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
YUMA: Yep, and the bigger
they are the Harder they fall!

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.460
Wait, yuma!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.630
Maybe it's you who's
fallin' for a trap!

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.960
ASTRAL: Bronk is right,
we must be careful.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
Careful schmareful,
attack, utopia!

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.560
No wait!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.290
Cut Right through
that mist!

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.830
Oh no!

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.090
Go Rising sun slash!

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.390
I did it!

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.460
I won!

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.760
And to the Victor go the spoils.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.690
Or in this case, the number 96!

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.530
Way to duel, yuma!

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.760
Yeah, I got skills
that give the chills!

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.890
I'm tellin' you guys,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.090
these days, no one
can beat me!

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.790
I'm not just feeling the
flow, I am the flow!

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.730
Wow, you sure
are confident.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.490
Too confident
if you ask me.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.090
Don't forget
your roots, yuma.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.260
My roots?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.630
C'mon, be serious.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.890
I am being serious,
you got to where you are

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190
with my help.
We used to be a team!

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.030
Well now I'm a solo act!

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.060
And I never needed you anyhow.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.190
Ya know you got a
real big mouth!

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.760
No, you do!

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.990
I meant figuratively!

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.130
Well I mean literally!

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.360
Would you knock it off!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.160
No but I'll knock
bronk's block off!

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.290
Bring it on!

Duel period!

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.630
Now, who to throw down with...

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.990
boys will be boys.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.890
or in this case, babies.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.660
with Every new number card,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.160
a new Memory reveals itself.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
but this particular memory...

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.760
has left me with more
questions than answers.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.660
It's been three days
since bronk and I talked.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.390
That's the longest
we've gone since...

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.260
Well, since we first met.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.990
And how did you two meet?

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.530
Hi, I'm yuma tsukumo!

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.990
and it's my dream
to be a duel champion!

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.690
A duel champion?

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.960
So how many wins
do ya got so far?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.330
Actually, I haven't
won once yet.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.430
And he wants to be champ!

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.960
I'll never forget it.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.830
we were all laughing, then
he goes and challenges me.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.490
I will be a duel
champion, you'll see!

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.730
Only thing I'm seein'
is me with a "W"!

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.590
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.690
He totally kicked
my Butt that day...

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.830
but when I asked for a
rematch, he let me have one...

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.090
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.590
I won't give up, never ever!

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.130
Before I knew it,
I liked the kid.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.930
Before I knew it,
we were friends.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.530
What do ya
mean 'apologize?'

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.890
well one of you has
to be the bigger man.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.490
Yeah and bronk's way bigger than
me, so it'll have to be him.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.890
But...

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.260
yuma...

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.490
listen to your friend
Tori, she has a point.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.090
Bronk is your best friend.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.160
So why not simply swallow your
pride and go talk to him?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.290
I'll tell ya why.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.090
Cuz I had a big lunch
and I'm not hungry.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.660
Hey, hold up!

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.230
Well that's what ya get
for grabbing at me!

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.860
What is happening?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.830
Astral!

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.360
Don't see that everyday!

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.390
Wait...

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.890
number 96!

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.530
It is trying to
take control of me!

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.860
What do you mean "trying
to take control of you"?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.560
number 96: He means that
when you dropped your key,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.230
you allowed me to escape.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.690
And now that I am free,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.760
I can take control of your
dear friend, astral.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.160
Hey, let go of me!

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.330
TOGETHER: Put him down!

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.690
If This is a bad dream,
someone wake me up!

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.090
Oh, this is no
simple nightmare...

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.790
yuma, listen carefully,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.560
you must give your
utopia to bronk.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.230
But why?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.060
Just do it!

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.530
Bronk...

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.090
catch!

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.060
No way!

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.460
Astral, no!

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.090
Onto Step two...

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.560
acquiring number 39: Utopia!

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.990
Let me go, and tell me
what you did with astral!

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.290
I will be the one making
the demands here, not you!

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.230
And right now I am
demanding that number card!

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.290
Bronk, what's going on?

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.790
I don't know,

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.360
but I got a hunch it has
something to do with this key.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.190
If I can just get it back to
yuma, maybe things'll be okay.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.730
but that means I
gotta free Yuma first!

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.490
Hey Tall, dark and creepy,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.260
if ya want this number so
bad, beat me in a duel!

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.860
A duel?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.130
No, bronk!

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.660
Just run!
Forget me,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.190
and save yourself!

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.430
No way, no how, yuma!

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.460
I never leave a friend behind.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.560
And like it or not,
you're still my friend!

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.190
I am?

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.060
How touching.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.890
Very Well, let us duel!

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.430
Duel Disk go!

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.590
And duel gazer, let's roll!

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.260
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.860
Oh and by the way,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.030
yuma will be dueling for me.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.690
Not his mind, but his body.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.360
So be careful...

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.090
I'm gonna go first!

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.590
So get ready!

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.890
My draw!

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.290
First, I'm summonin'
out aye-Iron!

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.490
Next I'll deck aye-Iron out with
the equip spell spring punch!

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.160
Then I activate
aye-Iron's special ability!

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.860
So now my aye-Iron packs on
400 pounding attack points!

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.790
And that activates
spring punch's effect!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.690
When my monster gains
attack points,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.830
you take half its attack
points as damage!

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.060
That equals a thousand!

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.260
Yuma!

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.330
Don't worry
about me, bronk.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.960
Just keep dueling!

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.260
Next I activate the spell card
gearspring Catapult and then...

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.230
I end my turn!

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.190
hold on pal,
I'm gonna save ya...

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.760
my turn now!

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.160
So draw!

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.930
First up, I am
summoning acorno!

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.930
I can summon this card
by sending one card

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.190
in my hand to the graveyard.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.630
And you see,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.430
since the card I sent
to the grave is

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.260
pinecono, it now sprouts up

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.790
right back on the field!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.490
Next I summon forth darklon!

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.960
And now you're in a
very hairy situation.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.330
You see, when darklon is
summoned, all my monsters

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.160
increase their level by 1.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.630
But I'm not done yet, next I'm

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.990
overlaying these three level 2's
in order to build the overlay

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:16.030
network and xyz summon a copy of
myself - Number 96: Dark mist!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.890
Oh man, that thing already
summoned a number card!

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.290
Wait, how is that
thing dark mist?

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.330
I know, it's completely
different from before!

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.460
That is because This is dark
mist's True appearance.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.030
And now dark mist,
attack aye-Iron!

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.590
He's attacking me
with just 100 points?

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.990
Not exactly.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.230
I activate dark mist's special
ability - Shadow gain!

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.090
By Using One overlay Unit,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.360
dark mist Can steal half of your
monster's attack points in order

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.390
to power itself up!

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.930
Then that means dark mist will

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.990
always have more attack points
than whatever monster I got!

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.430
You catch on quickly!

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.660
Now,

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.930
let him have it!

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.090
Whiplash WHIRLWIND!

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.490
Next I place two cards
facedown and end my turn!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.690
I guess now I know
what I'm up against,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.060
and I'm not scared at all!

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.460
Cuz I got the spell card

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.930
gearspring catapult
backing me up!

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.590
Now every time
it's my turn,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.330
I Crank one gearspring counter!

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.730
Counter?

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.830
That's right.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.330
If I'm gonna Max
out my card's effect,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.390
I gotta increase
my counters!

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.590
Oh Please, this duel will not
last long enough for that

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.190
strategy to work out.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.730
Next I summon tin goldfish!

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.130
But I'm not done yet,
now, I play iron call!

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.190
And it's gonna be
a call to arms!

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.330
Since there's a machine-Type
monster on my field,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.130
I can summon a level 4-Or-Below

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.890
machine right from my graveyard!

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.590
So jump back in this, aye-Iron!

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.190
Then I activate the spell
card Iron Draw from my hand!

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.990
See, since there are two
machine-Type monsters

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.230
on my field, iron
draw lets me draw

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.790
two more cards!

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.760
don't worry yuma,
you're gonna be safe soon!

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.760
Now I'll be overlaying level 4
tin goldfish and aye-Iron...

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.990
and creating the
overlay network!

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.590
And you know
what that means!

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.230
Here comes an xyz summon!

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.060
Appear, number 39: Utopia!

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.460
Utopia...

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.090
I have been waiting
for you, number 39.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.060
Yuma, what's happening?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.960
It's like...

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.430
I can feel its
power... alright!

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.660
Next I play gearspring
Catapult's effect!

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.630
By Using One gearspring counter,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.190
I can increase utopia's attack
points by 500 this turn.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.660
3000 attack points!

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.990
That's right!

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.290
Now attack, utopia!

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.590
Yes by all means, please go
right on ahead and attack...

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.360
so that I can play dark
Mist's ability - Shadow gain!

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.230
Oh man!

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.960
You can even use that
ability during my turn?

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.160
Dark Mist stole
utopia's attack points!

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.560
And it is going
to use them, too!

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.830
Look out, bronk!

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.930
Go Whiplash whirlwind!

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.790
I activate utopia's
special ability!

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.060
It stops utopia
from attacking!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.560
Way to Play
'd', bronk!

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.990
Way to play right
into my hands!

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.430
I now play the trap

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.730
counterforce!

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.990
Since you stopped
your utopia's attack,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.460
you take damage equal to
the difference in our two

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.890
monsters' attack points!

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.990
Wait, so bronk gets hit
with 1100 points of damage?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.790
Oh No, bronk!

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.530
Perhaps now you see,

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:25.130
for every move you make,
I can make one better!

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.690
We're in trouble...

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.560
how am I going to
beat this thing?

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.430
It gets stronger whenever
it attacks or I attack it!

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.390
Stay Tough, ya hear me?

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.590
yuma...
yuma...

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:47.730
astral?

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.360
Is that you?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.260
Yuma listen carefully,
I have a plan...

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.490
from my hand,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.890
I activate the spell
automatic gearspring machine!

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.460
Automatic, 'cause
fro e second

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.230
it hits the field, it's
got two gearspring counters.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.430
Then every time my
turn comes, it gets one more.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.390
But the best part is by sending
this card to the graveyard,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.390
I can move its
gearspring counters

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.530
to a completely
different card!

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.230
And just what are you planning
with All those counters?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.690
You'll find out,
trust me.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.190
Next I'll throw a facedown,

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.260
and end my turn, which means
catapult's effect vanishes,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.430
and utopia loses 500 points.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.830
[screaming]

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.990
what's going on?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.890
Yuma!

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.360
Do Not fret about yuma.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.690
He is just getting into
his role as my pawn!

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.660
And now it is...
my draw!

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.990
First, dark mist
will attack utopia!

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.860
But not before mist
gains some power...

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.960
from the shadows!

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.890
I play utopia's
special ability!

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.860
Light Wing shield!

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.730
Nothing Can
protect him now!

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.760
Not once I play...

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.060
Overlay banish!

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.830
It negates your monster's
special ability!

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.860
But you know
what is not negated?

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.060
Whiplash whirlwind!

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.290
Get up, bronk!

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.760
Yes Please do,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.460
so you can now see me destroy
your gearspring catapult!

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.860
No way!

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.590
Did you really think
that I was going to

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.560
let you keep your spell card?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.990
It is obvious you are
planning to use it to power up

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.790
the next monster you summon.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.190
You're wrong.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.930
What bronk is planning
to do is take you

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.590
down with a single
finishing blow.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.190
A single blow?

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.730
Yes, his facedown card
is gearspring exploder.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.760
Don't give away
his strategy, yuma!

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.130
No, do.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.660
I find this all
quite enlightening.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.490
You see, with
gearspring exploder,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.160
when it becomes bronk's
turn and he gains counters,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.490
he'll deal 800 points of damage
for every counter that he has.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.090
800 points?

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.630
So next turn...

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.960
gearspring catapult and
automatic gearspring machine

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.690
will each gain one counter for a

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.160
total of four.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.890
And that will mean a total
of 3200 points of damage.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.230
If gearspring exploder
activates, we will be defeated.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.330
Thanks for the info.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.160
Yuma...

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.560
in that case,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.960
I will just destroy
that facedown card.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.930
I am now activating the spell
xyz cyclone from my hand!

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.060
With this card, if an xyz
monster was destroyed,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.460
one trap card is
destroyed, as well!

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.430
so much for
gearspring exploder

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.730
and with that,
I will end my turn...

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.460
thank you, yuma.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.360
Always nice to get
the inside scoop.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.560
I can't believe it.
yuma sold me out.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.330
Your friend yuma has shown
me how to beat you.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.060
His loyalty to me
has sealed your doom!

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.430
Give up now, and I
will show you mercy.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.530
"I won't give up, never ever!"

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.530
same with me!

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.590
I won't give up!

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.830
just Like yuma never has!

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.360
wait a sec, and maybe
he still hasn't.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.930
of course!

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.730
Here goes,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.960
my draw!

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.490
Perfect.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.630
First Things first!

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.130
I put one counter on both

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.960
gearspring catapult and
automatic gearspring machine!

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.560
It is pointless to
keep fighting.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.030
Next I remove three counters

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.290
from automatic gearspring
machine to summon...

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.860
this!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.590
Gearspring spirit!

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.990
With the power of
gearspring spirit,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.890
I can change one of your
monsters' attack points to 0

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.830
until the end of this turn!

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.290
It what?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.690
Next I activate the spell
card Monster Reborn

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.390
so come on back utopia!

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.760
Yeah, way to go, bronk!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.860
Wait, what is
going on here?

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.660
Way to duel, bronk!

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660
Hold on,

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.130
you are my servant!

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.830
Yeah his body, but not his
mind. You said it yourself!

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.460
See, it's gearspring
catapult that's the key

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.760
to winning this match.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.690
If you destroyed it, I
wouldn't have had a chance!

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.690
That's why yuma pretended to
be your mindless servant.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.290
To trick you into
forgetting about my

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.660
catapult!

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.160
I do not believe it!

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.430
You better believe it. The only
people I serve are my buddies.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.730
I now activate gearspring
catapult's effect!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.030
By Removing one
gearspring counter,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.290
utopia gains 500 attack points!

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.030
I do not like this!

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.830
Well then you're gonna
positively hate

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.430
what's coming up next!

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.590
Do Ya feel it, bronk?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.760
I sure do!

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.030
You bet. I'm feeling the flow!

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.030
This cannot be!

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.230
Go Rising sun slash!

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.760
No way...I... I lost?

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.060
Impossible!

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.030
Hey Yuma, heads up!

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.130

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.560
Whoa...

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.630

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.990
Thanks, pal!

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.190
And Thanks for setting me up for
that way awesome Combo move!

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.790
Uh...Yeah, it's
uh my pleasure.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.930
Oh, it was astral's idea, huh?

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.890
No way, of course not!

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.230
Astral Had nothing to do with
it, ya know, for the most part.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.560
I knew it.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.890
I figured it was too
smart a plan for you!

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.390
What?
How dare you!

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.630
I bet you wish you
were half as smart as me!

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.830
Well yuma, I'm smart
enough to take that bet.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.390
Why I oughta...

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.860
only friends so close
could fight so much.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.060
Take it back!

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.290
You gotta lotta nerve!

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.690
I demand an apology!

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.433
If only all fighting could
be so harmless.

00:21:44.433 --> 00:21:47.933
Number 96.
Are there more memories like you?
