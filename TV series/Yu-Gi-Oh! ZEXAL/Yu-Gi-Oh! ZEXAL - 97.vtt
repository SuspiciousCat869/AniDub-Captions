WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.562
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:06.142
(Yuma)
I'm gonna beat
you, Vector!

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.602
And for what you did to Ray...

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:11.142
I promise I'll make you pay.

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:13.344
Utopia Ray V...

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:15.413
slice Masquerade with
Spinning Blades of Destruction!

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:23.454
Ray...

00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:26.457
Ray, you're okay!

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:28.693
(gasping)

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:36.167
Go Barian Battlemorph!

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:40.338
Vector!

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:42.807
You disguised yourself as Ray.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:45.076
What did you do with
him, Vector?

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:46.944
I'm Vector...

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.446
and I'm your
little friend Ray, too!

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.449
The Vector you dueled before

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.184
and the one who's been
dueling you here were my clones.

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.388
But the whole time, I,
the real Vector,

00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:00.358
took the form of your
very good friend Ray Shadows.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.296
"Ray" was a Barian.

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:08.266
I attack with Utopia Ray V!

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.269
Go!

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:13.170
I activate the
trap Vain Betrayer!

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.108
For every "V" card that was
sent to the graveyard,

00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:19.443
five cards in your deck go
straight to the graveyard too!

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:24.915
He destroyed your deck.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:26.884
You only have three cards left.

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.453

You and your friends

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:40.758
Doomed...

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:41.959
because of you!

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.461
You're through, Yuma.

00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:45.296
There's nothing left for you.

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:47.465
No revenge.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.166
No victory.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.735
Nothing.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.739
(Caswell)
I can't believe Ray
was a Barian.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.441
I can't believe Yuma knew it
and kept it a secret from us!

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.078
But why would he do that?

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:03.280
I don't know, but he
must have had a good reason

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:06.817
I place...

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.386
I place one card facedown...

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.454
and end my turn.

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:13.457
And now, you'll suffer
Sargasso's effect!

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.194
(screaming)

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:24.335
You have more shocks
in store, Yuma.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.304
Remember, every
time you play, you pay.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.709
Vector clearly enjoys exploiting
the vulnerabilities

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:36.447
of human psychology to
advance his devious strategy.

00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:40.751
Yeah, and it's all
because of me.

00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.453
I was careless as well.

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:44.455
I should have suspected
something was not quite right

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:47.191
the very moment you
started playing

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.459
those evil Barian cards.

00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:50.795
Just say it, Astral.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.130
Just say that if I'd told
you about Ray being a Barian,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.466
none of this would've happened!

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:58.302
Yuma...

00:03:58.302 --> 00:03:59.437
At least that's honest!

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:01.205
You've been a very naughty boy,

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:03.374
keeping secrets from your
partner, Astral.

00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:06.143
Vector won't let up
'till he tears Yuma down.

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:09.447
That rat.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.981
What else do you
expect from a Barian?

00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.317
You chose me over your partner.

00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:15.920
That makes you a traitor!

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.889
You said that was to
protect Astral!

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.425
Ahhh... Excuses,
excuses!

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:25.095
Be quiet!

00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:27.164
(Astral)
Yuma is falling
for Vector's mind games.

00:04:27.164 --> 00:04:29.867
Why will Yuma not listen
to me anymore?

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:32.436
What is this...

00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:36.140
This profound uneasiness?

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:41.445
It feels like a stain.

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.914
A blot of darkness
is growing...

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:46.450
What is it?

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.818
What is it?

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.087
Let's get back to the duel!

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.225
My turn...

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.459
I draw!

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:57.428
I activate the spell card
Glorious Numbers!

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:02.032
When there are no
monsters on my field,

00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:04.435
this card lets me summon a
Number from the graveyard!

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:08.439
So return, Number 104...

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.442
Masquerade!

00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:14.178
But there's more!

00:05:14.178 --> 00:05:15.446
Glorious Numbers also lets
me draw a card!

00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:18.983
And then I'll I activate
Masquerade's special ability.

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:22.820
It sends one card in your
deck to the graveyard.

00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:27.458
But when it uses
this special ability,

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:30.127
Masquerade can't attack.

00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:32.463
Careful, Yuma.

00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:33.864
You only have two cards left.

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:35.900
If you lose this duel,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.434
you'll be stuck in
this wasteland forever.

00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:40.437
And who knows what will
happen to the friends

00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:42.840
who came with you?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.009
Wait, you mean...

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.944
We're gonna be stuck
in Sargasso forever too?

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:49.947
That's cat-astophic!

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:51.849
We never should've come here!

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.451
Yuma...

00:05:57.454 --> 00:06:01.325
Oh, that face of yours
is priceless!

00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:03.861
That's why pretending to be
a friend to you pathetic humans

00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:07.197
was so much fun!

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:09.466
You're the pathetic one!

00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:12.236
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:17.007
It is my move.

00:06:17.007 --> 00:06:18.442
I activate Star Seraph
Sentry's special ability!

00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:21.912
When this monster uses
one Overlay Unit,

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:24.448
your monster not only
loses all its special abilities,

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:28.052
but its attack points are
also slashed in half!

00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:38.462
Go, Star Seraph Sentry!

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:40.698
Attack Shark Drake with
Lightning Cluster!

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:51.875
Shark!

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.277
Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:55.746
Attack Galaxion...

00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:58.215
Tachyon Spiral of Destruction!

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.459
No!

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:10.060
Shark!

00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:12.463
Kite!

00:07:12.463 --> 00:07:13.731
(Vector) See what you've done?

00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:15.466
Your friends are suffering
because of you.

00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:19.136
Quiet!

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:20.971
It's my move and
I'm gonna activate

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.142
the trap card Shark Splash!

00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:27.444
This card brings back
Shark Drake

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:29.446
but with 1,000
fewer attack points!

00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:38.756
And you take damage equal to
Shark Drake's attack points!

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.099
All right!

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:51.001
Well done.

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:54.071
But you summoned
an Xyz Monster,

00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:56.040
so you get hit
with Sargasso's effect.

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:01.979
Shark!

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:03.213
(Rio) It's okay.

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:05.816
Reginald knows exactly what
he's doing, Bronk.

00:08:05.816 --> 00:08:08.285
Getting hit is
part of his strategy.

00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:11.422
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.830
My turn.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.898
I draw!

00:08:20.898 --> 00:08:21.999
Shark Drake it's time
to drag him to the deep!

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:25.302
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:31.442
Appear, Chaos Number 32:
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.853
Oh, no!

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:43.987
Here comes Sargasso's effect!

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.461
This is what Reginald wants.

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:53.263
He knows if you summon
Shark Drake Veiss

00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:55.099
when you have 1,000
or more life points,

00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:57.301
it gets destroyed.

00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.703
He used Sargasso's effect to
take his own life points down

00:08:59.703 --> 00:09:02.439
to 900 so his monster
would survive.

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:05.375
Whoa... that
really takes guts.

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:08.145
Not many duelists would
do what you did.

00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:11.014
I am impressed.

00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:13.350
I know someone like you.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.919
You remind me of him.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.721
Behind your wild words
and reckless actions,

00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:20.924
I sense true skill.

00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:24.061
I wish we could
have faced each other

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.462
under different circumstances.

00:09:25.462 --> 00:09:27.898
Too bad that
will not be the case.

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:30.734
I'm not here to chat.

00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:33.403
My turn.

00:09:33.403 --> 00:09:35.239
I draw!

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:37.374
I activate the spell card
Triangle Evolution!

00:09:37.374 --> 00:09:41.245
When I Xyz Summon,
my one monster counts

00:09:41.245 --> 00:09:43.781
as three monsters!

the trap Neutrino Dowsing!

Barian's Force to the graveyard
