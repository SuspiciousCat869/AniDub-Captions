WEBVTT

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.836
So where are we going?

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.139
And how do you know
where the Numbers are?

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.611
I found them... in the
depths of your memories.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:11.945
My memories?

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.347
What do you mean?

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.016
You will find out soon enough.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.886
But before you
search for the Numbers,

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:23.257
you must find him.
Who?

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.062
(Astral)
The map your father sent us
is indicating the location

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.865
of the second Mythirian Number.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.432
Whoa.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:35.068
It's in some ruins
on a remote island.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.503
Sounds like this
could be tricky.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.373
And ''tricky'
means ''dangerous.'

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.241
Bring it on!

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.479

Thank you, sir.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:59.553
Your generous donation made this
children's library possible.

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.188
There's no need to thank me.

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:06.560
I'm just glad I could do
something for the kids.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.109
It's all set, sir.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.645
They'll be at the harbor
with the stuff tonight.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:27.080
Remember, all I care
about is the stuff.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.051
If anything or anyone gets in
your way you know what to do...

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.955
Uh, yes sir, of course...

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:38.959
(man)
I'm shocked.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.429
In public he's the compassionate
politician who'll do anything

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.263
for the people.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:46.566
But behind closed doors,
he's a crooked con-man

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.803
who'll do anything
to get the edge.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:52.305
You have a split personality.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:55.042
You little punk!

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.416
I wonder which one is the real
you, Congressman Parker.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:09.423
Well, that depends on if you're
asking me or the congressman.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.863
You are different.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.333
You are no ordinary human.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.503
Because I'm not a human.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.640
I am Vector, one of the
seven Barian Emperors,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.710
and your loyal subject.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.745
You have got to be joking.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.613
A Barian emperor...

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.649
wants to be my minion?
Yes.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.418
You deserve to be
the one true emperor,

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.822
and I can be the one
to help you do it.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.890
Why me and not you?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.358
We both have the same goals,

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.594
but you're more
powerful than I am.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.795
It makes more sense.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.898
If you think we both have the
same goals, you are wrong.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.501
Neither of us has any interest
in saving Astral World.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:58.171
True, but I don't feel like
saving Barian World either.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:02.476
Well maybe I'm feeling
the exact same way.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.010
Oh?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.445
Let me prove it to you.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.782
What if I give you the
location of a new Number?

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:11.852
You know where a Number is?

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:14.187
I told you I could
help you, didn't I?

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.790
Wait a second,
is that a Barian card?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.793
You are willing to
give me Barian power?

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:24.297
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you invincible.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.565
All right then.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:29.402
I will go along with your plan.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.509
I borrowed this man's
body so I could have

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.711
fun ruining the human world,

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:41.414
but I was becoming rather bored.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:47.053
Come now, my pet!

00:04:58.565 --> 00:04:59.065
That hurt.

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.268
We told you to stay
in your seat, Yuma.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.171
The ride seems a lot
bumpier this time.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:07.808
This turbulence is an unusual
and troubling phenomenon.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:11.378
I wonder what could
be its cause?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.583
I guess this is our
in-flight entertainment.

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:29.930
Charming spot to
find a new Number.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.636
(Vector)
What's this feeling?

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:40.907
Like something's taken over!

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:44.744
It's not funny!

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.113
So you can feel it?

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.449
What did you just do?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.485
You do not need to
know right now.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.787
Tell me!
Silence!

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:57.624
You are to set your
sights on Number 96.

00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:00.660
You must absorb his power.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.361
(Vector)
I will.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.297
I'm just waiting for
the right moment.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:07.601
Excuse me!

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.568
Sorry.

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.771
I'm coming.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:20.380
All right.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.050
So which way do we go now?

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.322
This way.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.092
Well.

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:34.427
I suppose you've
been here before.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:40.600
No, but I'm familiar with
the legend of this ruin.

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:45.805
Hey guys... this is it.

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:50.110
That's where the
Mythyrian Number is.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:59.386
Okay, let's go inside.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.454
Yuma...

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:04.257
this place feels dangerous.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:04.925
Dangerous?

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.728
I just think that the best thing
to do is stay out of there.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.564
But then how will
we acquire the Number?

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:15.535
Well, we'll have to
do it carefully.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.206
Kind of spooky in here.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.310
Look at the walls.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.780
All these drawings
must tell a story.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.349
It's the story
of the ancients...

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:32.519
and their sadness.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.821
So what are they grieving about?

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.924
Could we just find the Number
and get out of here, please?

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.960
The grief of those
past lives sheds tears

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.897
and it can't be healed by time.

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:47.667
This is the legend
of this cursed place.

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:51.137
Ages ago, a cruel prince
lived in this palace

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.872
and ruled the island.

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.375
He looked on all
people with suspicion,

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.178
so he drove all his
people into exile,

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:00.380
but the hateful
prince soon discovered

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.784
he had left himself in exile!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.856
I'm fine now.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:13.426
(Astral)
This ancient ruler...
why would he betray

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:17.764
those he should have protected?

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:22.268
Guess this place is cursed.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.274
(Vector)
This is the where the ruler
of this island dealt with

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:32.379
his enemies, where he
would pass judgment on them.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:37.183
I have a feeling I would
have liked this guy.

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:44.891
They're here.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.793
Yuma and Astral are here.

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.461
(Dark Mist)
Good.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.231
Now I will crush them just
as that ancient prince

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.566
crushed his enemies.
No, you won't!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.102
I'm going to defeat Yuma,
you got that?

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.605
(Don Thousand)
This is not your time.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:02.275
(Vector)
What? What is
Don Thousand doing?

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.511
To help me crush those fools,

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:08.848
I must retrieve that Number.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.897
What's going on?

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:36.009
So you 're the one who' s
protecting the Number.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.047
I see.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.083
You apparently
want a duel to prove

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.453
which one of us is stronger.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:52.492
I'm ready!

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.961
Duel!

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.571
How do we know which
way we should go now?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.742
That star must be some
kind of guidepost.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:10.343
But maybe not.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.745
Yeah, it could be
some kind of trap.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:13.780
Don't worry.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.316
Just follow me.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.959
What's that weird
rumbling sound?

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:32.398
What do we do?
Run!

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.338
Yuma it's getting closer!

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.007
Just keep running!

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.776
Another star!

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.085
Well, no harm done.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:52.552
What?

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:55.355
We followed your lead and
we almost wound up squashed

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:58.124
by a gigantic boulder!

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.126
Pretty exciting, huh?

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:03.096
I wonder who left
those star symbols.

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.664
I bet it was my dad.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.099
Why would your dad leave them?

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:08.635
Oh 'cause he's always
doin' stuff like that.

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.637
He must've marked the
path with stars to show

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:12.472
the best way to avoid the trap.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:14.507
Well that was smart thinking...

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.409
Yeah, I am pretty smart.

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:20.680
She was talking
about him, not you!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.492
I don't like it here!

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.165
Are you all right?

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.466
What the...

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.102
We... where are we?

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.238
Hey, Yuma!
Yuma!

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:47.607
Hey, guys... are
you all okay?

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:48.741
I'm good.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:49.809
Guess this was a trap.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:54.280
Yuma 's father isn' t as
special as I thought.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.218
(Vector)
Well, look who's here.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.887
Hello, Yuma.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.888
Vector!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.224
Are you not going to
call me Ray anymore?

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.326
I guess that means
we're not as good friends

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.528
as we used to be.

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:09.963
You were never my friend!

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.731
I hate to break
the news to you, Yuma,

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.335
but I've already taken the
Number you came here for.

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:15.835
Why you...

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:18.304
But since you went to the
trouble to come all the way

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:19.539
here, let's have fun.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.242
Let's have a duel and
the winner gets the Number.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:26.546
Anything to make sure
you don't get it!

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:34.153
Well in that case, I'll have to
upgrade you to a ringside seat.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.326
Yuma!

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.066
I suppose I should mention
that if you don't know how

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:51.804
the mechanics of this thing
works, there's no getting out!

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.173
The Number's taught me a lot
about the little tricks

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.876
and traps in the
Labyrinth of Screams.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:59.746
That's what they
call it, you know.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:00.546
Quit messing with me!

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:04.217
There's no way I can fight
a duel from this puny pedestal!

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:04.984
You won't have to.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.121
You 're not the one who' s
doing the dueling.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.489
Astral is.

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.857
Wait, what? Astral?

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:14.527
Don't trust him, Yuma,
don't let Astral duel!

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:15.862
Now, now, now.

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:18.398
This is not Yuma's decision.

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:19.832
That is true.

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.735
No, Astral!

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:25.538
I have decided to accept
your challenge.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:26.606
Let us begin.

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:30.777
I never said
I would duel, Astral.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.617
This can't be!
It is Number 96!

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.085
Nice to see you again, Astral,

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:43.790
especially in such a perfect
setting for an all out duel.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.325
Here's the Number.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.359
Shall we start?

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:48.695
So you being here,
does this mean you have

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:49.962
teamed with that Barian?

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.865
He sought me out and
begged me to help him.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.902
I felt bad for
the boy and I agreed.

00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:59.205
Now I will duel you
and defeat you!

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:03.042
That will not happen.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:09.716
Yuma, I need to duel
with your cards!

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.686
Yeah!

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:20.893
Things are different now,
Astral, I'm much more powerful.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:24.030
And there's no way
you can beat me!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.232
Let us duel!
Let us duel!

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.272
Let us duel!
Let us duel!

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.175
I draw!

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:39.946
I summon Malicevorous Spoon!

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:46.586
Then by sending Malicevorous
Knife to the graveyard,

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:50.823
I can summon Malicevorous Fork.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.395
I'm not finished setting
the table for your defeat!

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.397
Malicevorous Spoon
lets me summon another

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.666
Malicevorous monster
from my graveyard!

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.871
Slice and dice,
Malicevorous Knife!

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:12.245
He's already got three
Level 2 monsters.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:17.617
I overlay Level 2 Malicevorous
Spoon, Knife and Fork!

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:21.888
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.891
and Xyz Summon my ''alter ego,'

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:26.793
my evil avatar...

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:30.730
Number 96, Dark Mist!

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:36.936
Not that again!

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.304
Whenever Dark Mist battles,

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:42.775
if it uses one Overlay Unit,
it steals half the opponent

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:46.045
monster's attack points,
and adds those precious

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.613
attack points to itself.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.184
In other words, Dark Mist's
special ability ensures that it

00:15:51.184 --> 00:15:54.086
will always have at
least 100 attack points

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.321
more than its opponent.

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:58.858
So you'll always be
playing catch up.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:02.161
Now I end my turn.

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:05.164
Your move!

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.499
Very well then.

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:07.467
I draw!

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.602
I summon Toy Knight
from my hand!

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:15.007
I can summon it when I have
no monsters on my field.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:24.584
And now I summon
another Toy Knight!

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.022
Okay Astral, the stage is set!

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:32.625
Summon Utopia!

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.227
If you think you're fooling me,

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:36.295
you're making a fateful mistake.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.131
I know that the reason you
summoned two Toy Knights

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.467
isn't so you can summon Utopia.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.703
It's because you're trying
to make Dark Mist use

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:46.472
its Overlay Units on
the those Toy Knights.

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:49.642
Since those monsters don't have
many attack points, you think

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:54.146
you've found the way to limit
the damage you'll have to take.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:57.717
I activate the trap
Small Stopper!

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.953
Thanks to its effect, monsters
with 1,000 or fewer attack

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:05.057
points on the
field can't attack.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:08.194
And when monsters in
attack mode don't attack,

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:12.765
you take 1,000 points of damage
at the end of the turn.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:13.332
This stinks.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.401
Now Astral can't attack
with his Toy Knights

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.738
and he's gonna take
1,000 points of damage.

00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:24.043
I overlay my two
Level 4 Toy Knights!

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:28.648
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:31.918
and Xyz Summon!

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:37.924
Appear, Number 39:
Utopia!

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.299
I know the Toy Knights
couldn't attack anymore

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:49.635
but if you think Utopia's
gonna help, you're wrong.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.004
No way Utopia
can beat Dark Mist!

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.940
This isn't gonna work, Astral!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.143
Yuma, do you think
I would summon Utopia

00:17:57.143 --> 00:17:59.812
without good reason?

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:00.846
What's he mean?

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:04.483
I activate the equip
spell Guard Robe Exchange

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:05.451
from my hand!

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:10.790
Cloak Utopia with 500
additional attack points!

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.393
Utopia, attack Dark Mist!

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:17.964
I activate Dark Mist's
special ability!

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.833
It uses one Overlay Unit
to steal half

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.336
your monster's attack points.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:26.072
Shadow Gain!

00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:39.251
That thing's strong enough
to take out Utopia!

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:42.254
Face the facts, Astral,
your friend is right!

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.923
Only if I do not act.
What?

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:48.327
Witness as Guard Robe
Exchange's effect activates!

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:50.262
When Utopia's attack
points change,

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:53.065
you take damage
equal to the change!

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:57.770
And that change equals
1,500 points of damage.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:04.210
Astral used Dark Mist's
special ability against him.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:17.189
And now, I use one
of Utopia's Overlay Units

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:20.559
to negate this battle!

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.228
All right!

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:24.830
The first round goes to Astral!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.831
That was impressive.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.366
But you don't think
I'm stupid enough

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:30.036
to take damage
for nothing, do you?

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:32.538
Meaning?

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.975
What's that?

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.112
Yuma!

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.447
What's going on?

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:43.015
(Vector)
Oh, I forgot to mention.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:47.186
Every time Number 96 loses life
points, you my former friend

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.723
might end up losing more
than just a hair or two.

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:54.360
What? Are you insane?

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.263
Oh, man...

00:19:57.263 --> 00:19:59.398
So every time Astral
attacks him...

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.034
He'll put Yuma in great danger!

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:02.835
That's just evil.

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.337
Say whatever you like,
but I bring much more

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.472
than cards to this duel.

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:09.442
This Labyrinth of Screams is an
elaborate trap that makes every

00:20:09.442 --> 00:20:12.745
one of your moves
extremely dangerous.

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:15.014
And so, if you win...

00:20:15.014 --> 00:20:18.150
Yuma doesn't.
