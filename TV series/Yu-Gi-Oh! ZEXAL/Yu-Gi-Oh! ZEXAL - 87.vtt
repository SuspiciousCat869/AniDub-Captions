Looks like someone's
missing, Yuma!

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:44.431
Ray better show
up for your sake!

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.103
Where's your pal Ray, so
we can get this duel started?

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:51.571
He couldn't
make it Girag!

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:54.407
So you'll just
be losing to me!

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:57.978
So Girag told Yuma he
wanted to duel against me?

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.079
Yeah.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.948
So that means...
Yuma did lie to me.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.852
Well Ray, I'm sure Yuma had
his reasons for not telling you.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.420
Where is
this duel?

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.556
Uh, why do
you wanna know?

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.524
Because Yuma went
to fight my duel,

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.693
and I can't let him
face that giant alone.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.028
You sure that's
a good idea?

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.029
When you get
involved, things...

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.464
(Ray)
I know.

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:20.600
Things don't always end up
the way I planned them to.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.802
But this time
will be different!

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:26.139
You gotta trust me
and take me to him!

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.308
I can't believe
Ray didn't show!

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:31.444
Enough, can't you just forget
about Ray already, Girag?

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.947
Besides I thought you
Barians wanted my Numbers,

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.215
so come
and get 'em!

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.283
I'm sick of you
messin' with my plans.

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:39.285
This is between
me and Ray, got it!

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.054
So why don't you
just butt out, okay!

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:42.422
Listen
up Girag,

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:46.993
the only way you're
getting to Ray is through me!

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.294
Why you
little...

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.764
All right, this calls
for a change of plan.

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:53.533
I'll crush
you and Ray!

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:58.905
(Ray)
Hold everything!

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.974
Ray,
you're here?

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.275
You shouldn't
have come!

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.677
This Girag guy
means serious business!

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:07.714
So then why did you
decide to come here and duel?

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.149
Well,
because...

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.785
Is it because you think I
can't take care of myself?

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.186
That I'll mess
things up like I do

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.854
with most
everything else?

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.389
No, you got
it wrong...

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.792
Look I know I'm
kinda new to dueling,

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:22.028
but I can't let you
fight my battles for me!

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.631
I get you.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.800
I believe
in the Ray Way.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.901
But what I can't
believe is that

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.504
you actually thought
I was gonna study.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:33.573
If you two are
done chit-chattin',

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.676

both of you on in a duel?

With Giant Hand on the field,
