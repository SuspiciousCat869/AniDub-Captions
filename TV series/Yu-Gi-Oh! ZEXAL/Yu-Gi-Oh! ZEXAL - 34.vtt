WEBVTT

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.830
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.960
QUATTRO: Which of my fabulous
fans should I take on today?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.990
So many potential
targets to choose from.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.190
Quinton: Your attitude
seriously concerns me, quattro.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.060
I take it you understand
what your mission is today,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.490
don't you, Trey?

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.990
Trey: Yes, brother.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.330
The duelist they call shark
is still trying to track down

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.730
quattro.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.830
Better hold on to
this number card.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.360
I have a feeling that you'll be
running into each other very

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330
soon.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.890
Yuma: This is a strange
place to have a duel.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.690
Caswell: Quattro
picked the spot.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
Probably wanted Some place
quiet to avoid his fans.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190
I can't believe it's really you.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.560
Hey bronk, who do you
think should go first?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960
Bronk: I dunno.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.390
I suppose all three
of us could duel at once.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.190
You two twerps are going
down with a big bang!

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.430
My giant will destroy
your feeble monsters,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.460
and end this duel!

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030
TORI: this is horrible.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.430
You maniac!

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.860
They looked up to you!

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.660
Why did you do this to them?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.160
Let's just say that I
find it highly entertaining.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.090
Shark: Hello quattro.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.530

This is payback day, quattro.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.160
Hello, shark.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.630
How are things?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.330
You still upset about
our duel at the nationals?

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.130
When you got kicked out.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.260
That never would've happened
if you didn't set me up.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.360
You got me there.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.890
By the way, how is that
precious sister of yours doing?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.990
Shark's got a sister?

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.530
What happened to her
is all your fault.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.190
I'll never forgive you.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.660
You made me lose sight of who I
am as a person and as a duelist!

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.360
I know I'll never get to
change what I did back then.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.860
But today, I get my revenge!

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.330
Well then let's duel.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.530
Just make sure you
don't Peek at my deck.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.360
What's this?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.230
A duel anchor.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.830
Now you and I can't separate
until we finish our duel!

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.330
Trey, this is between
shark and me.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.990
You stay out of this!

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.590
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.460
But shark has no
numbers, brother.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.860
So there isn't any need for you
to duel against him, now is

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.490
there? Vetrix Always says
our mission comes first.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.960
I'll have to crush you later.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.390
You can't leave!

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360
Come on! I challenged you!

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.160
Well if you want me,
make it to the finals.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.360
I've already got
my 5 heart pieces.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.160
Good luck shark.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.930
Quattro!

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.330
Calm down.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.890
You'll still get to duel, shark.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.130
You just get to duel me instead!

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.030
Astral: I have seen a
duel anchor before.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.860
Kite used one just
like it against yuma.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.760
Once it was attached,
there was no escaping.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.390
It would seem that quattro and
his brother are indeed number

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.260
hunters, but what purpose
do they need numbers for?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.930
Let's get Caswell some help.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.390
Right.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.990
Hey, I better come
with you guys.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.260
No, you stay here
and support shark.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.590
We can take care of
Caswell, don't worry.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.030
Yuma, I agree that
you should remain here.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.290
Alright.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.930
I'll stay then.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.060
Guess I'll have to deal with
your brother after I beat you!

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.960
It's crunch time!

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.860
I'm prepped and primed.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.330
Then let's settle this.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.990
Ready when you are!

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.290
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.630
Let's duel!

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.830
I'll go first, okay shark?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.290
Ready or not...

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.960
I draw!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.490
To start I'll activate the
field spell sunken kingdom!

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.330
Now any water attribute monsters
that get played gain 300 attack

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.130
points!

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.830
He should've warned
us we'd be underwater!

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.860
Give me an oxygen tank quick!

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.730
Yuma, this ocean
is virtual, remember?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.830
Next I summon my
chronomaly Mayan machine!

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.630
And now I'll end things with a
facedown and turn it over to

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.990
you, shark!

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.860
What's that chronomono-Thingy?

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.490
You mean chronomaly.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.860
They are artifacts that are too
advanced to have been built by

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.890
your primitive ancestors.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.490
Who made them or where
they came from is a mystery.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.930
Now, I draw!

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.330
I'm summoning hammer shark!

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.090
Thanks for playing this
sunken kingdom field spell!

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.660
Since my hammer shark is a
water monster, it gets 300

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.590
attack points stronger!

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.960
Unfortunately for you, monsters
that are level 4-Or-Below can't

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.990
attack chronomaly monsters
in the sunken kingdom.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.330
Hammer shark is useless here!

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.590
You think this field
can shield your monster.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.190
But...

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.330
I have a falling
current spell card!

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.160
This spell lets me pick a level
for my monster between one and

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.730
three.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.730
So I'm gonna lower my
hammer shark by one level!

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.530
I see your deck is full of
surprises shark, But lowering

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.530
your monster's level
won't help you very much.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.130
Tell that to big jaws!

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.560
Since I activated a spell card
this turn, I can let big jaws

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.190
loose to help me take a
bite out of your strategy!

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.460
But before I do anything, big
jaws powers up by 300 points!

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.560
And now I'll overlay my level 3
hammer shark and big jaws in

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.060
order to build the
overlay network!

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.760
Now I xyz summon

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.530
black Ray lancer!

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.660
Since Xyz monsters
don't have levels,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.160
sunken kingdom can't stop
it from attacking your mayan

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.490
machine.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.630
All right!

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.890
Great move!

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.890
Black ray lancer, go!

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.890
Attack With
Shimmering Spear slash!

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.890
Black ray lancer, go!

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.130
Attack With
Shimmering Spear slash!

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.760
I activate stonehedge methods!

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.760
When my chronomaly
Monster is destroyed,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.730
I can summon any rock-Type
chronomaly monster that's level

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.630
4-Or-Below in defense mode.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:24.130
So I'm summoning
chronomaly colossal head!

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.730
Guess I've done enough
damage for one turn.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.090
You're up.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.290
If you insist.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.890
I draw!

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.190
And I summon
chronomaly golden jet!

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.390
And now I'm gonna activate the
spell card orichalcum chain!

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.230
This chain gives me a
missing Link when I need it!

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.560
So when I want to xyz summon,
I can do it using one fewer

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.260
monster.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.630
Really?

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.490
But, using this spell
can be quite risky.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.560
If my chain is destroyed,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.090
you gain control of the xyz
monster that I summoned with it!

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.760
But there's no way I'm going to
let that happen, so do yourself

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.730
a favor and don't
even bother trying.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.630
It's time to put my
spell Card into action.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.090
First I'll overlay level 4
colossal head and golden jet!

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.460
Then with the help of my
orichalcum chain I can build the

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.460
overlay network!

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.190
I xyz summon

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.660
NUMBER 32: Shark Drake!

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.660
Very impressive.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.260
It gets better.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.830
Remember Sunken Kingdom will add
Three hundred attack points to

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.130
shark Drake's total!

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.730
Okay shark Drake, strike
down black Ray lancer!

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.830
Go Deep Sea destruction!

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.730
I activate shark Drake's
special ability!

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.930
After it destroys a monster in
battle, I can use an overlay

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.830
unit to summon the monster it
just destroyed back onto your

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.230
field.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.560
Only now it's a
thousand attack points weaker!

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.860
Then Shark Drake can battle
that monster all over again!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.360
That's double the attacks for me
and double the pain for you!

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.230
That sounds totally unfair!

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.290
He can attack
shark's monster again?

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.690
Indeed.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.590
The ability is quite rare.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.430
It is also quite effective.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.990
Shark Drake is the most
relentless attacker you've ever

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.660
seen. It's gonna destroy your
monster all over again.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.090
Go deep Sea destruction!

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.160
Shark!

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.390
Shark!

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.060
You gonna be okay?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.890
I'm gonna be fine!

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.260
One or two attacks
aren't enough to beat me.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.360
Well just to be sure I'll give
you a break and end my turn.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.660
But if you don't find a way to
stop shark Drake, this duel is

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.090
over.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.390
What can shark do?

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.760
He's done for.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.190
There is still one way for
him to prevail in this duel.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.000
I must take his number.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.330
Your number's gonna be mine,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.860
and I'll stop at
nothing to get it!

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.490
I summon skull kraken!

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.190
And now I'm activating skull
kraken's special ability.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.690
Once I summon this monster, I
can destroy a face-Up spell or

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.960
trap card that's on your field!

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.790
So I'm destroying
your orichalcum chain!

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.130
I did it!

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.860
Shark Drake is
under my control now!

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.360
perfect.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.560
now that you've done exactly
what I wanted you to do, I can

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.030
complete my mission.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.090
thanks for the help, shark.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.690
What's wrong?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.660
Number 32 SHARK DRAKE: Shark.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.990
You will let me enter
your mind and soul.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.190
With me as your ally,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.590
you will no longer need the
help of your so-Called friends.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.330
You're a good duelist.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.860
I'll see ya around.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.130
Thanks.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.260
And hey, maybe we can
do this again sometime.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.390
Aw come on, I thought
we were friends!

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.060
We are not friends,
you got that?

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.960
Why would you even
think that anyway?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.460
Why would I think
we're friends?

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.130
Because we dueled.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.430
I am all that you need in
This world. Let me take hold.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.230
I don't need you.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.290
I won't let you control me!

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.160
I'm in control and
you will obey me!

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.790
Okay, let's go!

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.390
he Should've been
possessed by the number!

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.490
Shark Has mastered
number 32's power.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.130
No way!

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.190
Your plan backfired, Trey.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.490
Go get him, shark Drake!

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.930
Deep Sea destruction!

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.260
Do it!

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.630
If this works, Trey will
get damaged big time!

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.090
No I won't!

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.530
I activate the trap

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.760
antikythira gear!

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.230
I can use this if you attack me
directly when you have two or

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.290
more monsters on your field.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.260
It lets me take control of your
non-Attacking monster and put it

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
in defense mode!

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.860
Not so fast!

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.560
I activate my own trap card!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.130
Extreme Pressure power lets me
destroy one of my monsters and

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.060
then draw a card from my deck.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.630
Looks like I just
out-Trapped your trap.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:28.230
Keep up with your attack.
Come on shark Drake!

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.490
I'll put two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.430
He's tougher than we thought.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.460
my mission was simple.
to give shark a number.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.160
once I finished my assignment,
vetrix told me I should let

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.130
shark win the duel.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.830
but he never said that I
had to make it easy for him!

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.790
Now shark, I draw!

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.930
And I play the spell
chronomaly technology!

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.430
Now if I banish a chronomaly
monster from my graveyard, I get

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.960
to draw two New
cards from my deck.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.190
Then I send one
to the graveyard.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.760
I summon chronomaly crystal
bones in attack mode!

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.990
I can summon this card when
you're the only one who has

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.930
monsters on the field!

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.790
And crystal bones' special
ability lets me bring back

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.260
chronomaly crystal skull
from the graveyard!

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.660
Rise up, crystal skull!

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.530
Now I overlay my level 3
crystal skull and crystal bones.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.090
With these two monsters I build
the overlay network and xyz

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.760
summon CHRONOMALY
crystal chrononaut!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.790
If I use an overlay unit, it
can't be destroyed in battle

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.890
this turn. And not only that,
you will take the damage that I

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.990
would've taken.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.330
Say what?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.430
To put it simply, your shark
Drake has a lot more attack

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.360
points than my chronomaly
Crystal chrononaut!

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.860
A thousand more!

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.430
And those extra points are
gonna come right at you!

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.730
Crystal chrononaut,

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.060
attack shark Drake!

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.890
Go reflect flash!

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.490
Attack Shark Drake!

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.660
Not good!

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.960
If this attack works, then...

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.230
face it, shark.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.460
You are sunk!

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.790
Then I'll get un-Sunk!

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.730
With the spell plate salvage!

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.760
It's time for a
change of scenery.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.390
Now your field spell Sunken
kingdom can't work for two

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.930
turns!

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.330
Whoa!

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.090
Who drained the bathtub?

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.160
That means sunken
kingdom's effect is history!

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.590
So now shark Drake
Loses 300 attack points!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.760
Brilliant!

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.990
By eliminating the field spell's
effect, shark lowered his

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.560
monster's attack points to limit
its damage and save himself.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.590
Only they're both down to just
three hundred life points!

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.560
This next attack should
determine the Winner.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.960
I can't believe it!

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.160
shark is great at
thinking on his feet.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.260
so I'm sure he'll try to use
shark Drake's special ability.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.990
I should just let him win this
duel, but where's the fun in

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.530
that?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.990
I'm ending my turn!

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.130
Throw your best at me, shark!

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.090
I draw!

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.830
Okay shark Drake, shatter
that crystal chrononaut!

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.730
Not so fast!

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.160
I'll use colossal head's special
ability to put the brakes on

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.860
Shark Drake!

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.930
When I banish this chronomaly
monster from my graveyard, I can

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.090
switch the monster on my field
from attack to defense mode!

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.260
I don't like this.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.890
Trey can't take damage when a
monster is in defense mode!

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.630
Perhaps.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.630
I activate shark
Drake's special ability!

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.690
By Using an OVERLAY unit When
shark Drake destroys a monster

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.030
in battle, it can bring it back
onto your field, but don't

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.630
forget, the revived monster now
has one thousand Less attack

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.730
points! And that's gonna
make you a prime target!

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.860
If you were hoping I'd forget
shark Drake's special ability,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.290
you were wrong.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.660
So now attack, shark Drake!

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.190
Actually I was right.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.030
You see, I knew you'd master
that number's special ability.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.260
So I'm ready with my trap
Chronomaly Ley line power!

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.690
A trap?

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.360
Exactly!

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.790
It's a trap that can exchange
the attack points of the two

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.290
monsters that are battling!

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.160
So now my Chrystal Chrononaut
is stronger than shark Drake!

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.430
Sorry, shark.
But it's over.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.790
Yes it is.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.030
You see, I expected you
to pull a move like that.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.560
So I had the ULTIMATE counter
card up my sleeve to finally put

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.090
an end to this duel.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.290
It's the trap card
sea King's verdict!

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.490
If your trap card activated
during a battle, this one

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.030
cancels it out!

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.460
Cancels it out?

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.360
Shark Drake, let's finish
this duel and finish them off!

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.260
Amazing!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.990
Shark Totally
reeled that guy in!

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.890
This was a most
impressive victory.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.660
Not bad, shark.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.960
You get this win, but next
time will be different.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.290
I made it to the finals.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.860
And I look forward to
facing you there.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.630
How did he win so
many duels already?

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.030
You can hold onto that
number card if you want.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.530
Think of it as a
souvenir of our duel.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.730
Where'd he go?

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.790
Yuma!

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.130
How's Caswell, Tori?

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.460
He'll be okay!

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.790
The med team told us he
just needs lots of rest.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.130
That's great!

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.560
I'll be over as soon as I can.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.660
Shark, wait!

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.260
Listen yuma, I want you
to keep your distance.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.230
I still have a score
to settle with quattro!

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.660
But shark!

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.160
Why isn't he
letting us help him?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.130
Come back!

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.990
now that shark has another
number, we will certainly have

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.130
to duel him again someday.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.290
Vetrix: That was
excellent work, Trey.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.860
Shark won't suspect a thing
because of the way you let him

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.390
win.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.360
To be honest, I think shark
would have won no matter how

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.290
hard I tried.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.030
You're just
being modest as usual.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.690
But sir, shark wasn't possessed
by the number so I failed.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.160
Not at all.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.790
Your mission was a success!

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.930
There is now a seed of darkness
inside shark's soul that will

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.160
grow over time,
consuming him completely!
