WEBVTT

00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.995
Yikes!

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:03.759
Whoever made that
sculpture should have

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.094
his art license revoked!

00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:07.129
(chuckling)

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.498
That's no sculpture,
you stooge!

00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:10.532
It's a machine!

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.535
And it's jam-packed
with Numbers I made!

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.470
Those cards are all fakes?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.005
As fake as your personality!

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.541
But once they're unleashed,
they will bridge

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.943
the human world
with Barian World!

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.546
And the complete and utter
destruction of Astral World

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.082
will finally be set in motion!

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:28.917
(laughing) (chuckling)

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:31.553
That plan sounds insanely
over-the-top...

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:33.522
which is why I love it so much!

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.457
Thank you!
As my fiendish flunky,

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:38.293
you'll spread my fake Numbers
among the humans!

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:39.094
And while you're at it,

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:42.097
you'll snatch Kite
and Shark's real Numbers!

00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:43.532
I'll get them!

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:44.533
That's a promise!

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.233
(grunting)

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.536
You'd better keep
that promise...

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:48.303
or else!

00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:49.905
(Heartland struggling)

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:51.206
I... swear!

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.942
I may have tolerated
your failures before,

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:55.844
but that time has passed!

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:57.012
Is that understood?

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:58.847
If I don't get those Numbers,

00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:01.383
you can turn me back
into a fly!

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.485
I'll do worse than that!

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:04.553
(shimmering)

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.888
Aah!
(grunting)

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.891
But if you break your
losing streak and succeed,

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:12.427
the reward will be priceless!

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:13.762
How would you like to become

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:16.431
one of the seven
Barian Emperors?

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:18.533
You'd make me an emperor?

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.168
Yes.

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:22.504
At last, my dream job!

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:24.139
But you only get your payoff

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:27.342
once Astral World
goes down in flames!

00:01:27.342 --> 00:01:29.544
Now, let's get things started!

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:31.546
Eyes to the skies, humans!

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:35.117
It's raining Numbers!

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:35.517

(crowd muttering)
Those look like cards!

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:42.217
(Crowd)
Why are they glowing?
Quick, grab one!

00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:43.552
Get it!
Quick!

00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:44.986
Grab it!
Can we keep 'em?

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:46.087
Grab it!
(crowd muttering)

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:47.989
Oh!
We should grab them.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.960
(growling) (groaning)

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.095
(growling)

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:59.167
(Don Thousand)
The Barian Assimilation
is proceeding without a hitch.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:02.037
(Vector)
But we still have to find
the Numeron Code.

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:05.340
The power of that card
is critical to our plan.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.543
True, but once Astral World
is destroyed,

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:13.148
there will exist no one
strong enough to challenge me!

00:03:13.148 --> 00:03:15.517
(laughing)

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:21.389
(Man) We have breaking news.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.526
People around the world
are losing their minds!

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.794
Welcome to Freakopolis.

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:29.097
If this keeps up, the whole
planet could fall into chaos.

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:33.535
It's spreading everywhere as if
it were some kind of infection.

00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:34.536
What could be causing it?

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.941
All this chaos is the result of
people picking up Number Cards!

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.409
(all) Number Cards?

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.344
(Trey) See for yourselves.

00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:44.546
How people got the Numbers
is a mystery.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:45.981
But based on my estimates,

00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:48.850
there's a card for every
person on earth.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.186
Are you sure you
didn't miscount?

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.088
Whoever is behind this...

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:54.823
Are experts in mind control.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:56.124
The Barians.

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:57.058
Right.

00:03:57.058 --> 00:03:57.526
Listen up!

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.295
Has anyone here found
a Number card recently?

00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:02.864
No!
I haven't seen any.

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:03.532
Me either.

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:05.534
(Trey)
Hey, guys, I'm picking
up something...

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.537
Looks to me like
Quinton's skyship!

00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:15.010
Do you think they'll know what
happened to Yuma?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.546
I haven't been able
to make contact with them,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.115
so I'm not sure.

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:31.526
(Bronk)
The portal exploded, so Yuma's
stuck in another dimension.

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:32.827
How could you let that happen?

00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:34.029
(Cathy) You have to fix it!

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:35.297
You just have to!

00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:36.398
I cannot.

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:37.265
(sighing)

00:04:37.265 --> 00:04:38.533
But wait!
That means Yuma

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.936
could be trapped there forever!

00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:42.003
Trapped forever?

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:44.105
How horrifying!
(crying)

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.241
You had one job,
one simple job...

00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.542
Keep the portal open!

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.077
And you couldn't even do that?

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:50.845
Quit flippin' out, Flip.
Relax!

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:53.548
Yuma's been in trouble
before, Cathy.

00:04:53.548 --> 00:04:56.851
And no matter what,
he always pulled through.

00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:58.553
You really think he'll come
back?

00:04:58.553 --> 00:05:01.289
Even if he's trapped
in another dimension,

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.325
Yuma will find a way home.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:04.159
Yeah!

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.895
And he'll bring Astral
back, too.

00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:09.230
(grunting)

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.465
Mm.

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:11.533
Au contraire!

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:13.768
(Heartland)
Sorry to rain
on your parade,

00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:16.137
but you can forget about Yuma.

00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:17.339
Heartland!

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.173
(all grunting angrily)

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:21.443
I'm afraid he won't be making
any encore appearances,

00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:24.179
'cause he and Astral
are gone for good this time!

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:27.515
Now, come on out and say hi!

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:31.019
(Heartland)
We're all reunited at last.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.154
I'm thrilled to see
you all again,

00:05:33.154 --> 00:05:37.525
but I'm guessing you may
not be as thrilled to see me.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:38.526
Am I right, Kite?

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:40.762
You'll find out!
Get down here!

00:05:40.762 --> 00:05:44.532
First things first.
I have something to show you.

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:46.234
Huh?

00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:49.304
(energy crackling)

00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:51.539
(Bronk) Whoa!

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.241
I didn't see that
in the weather forecast!

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:56.978
On with the show!
Hit the lights!

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:04.419
(crowd)
Barian! Barian! Barian! Barian!

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:10.158
(energy shimmering)

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.962
(grunting)

00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:15.463
(all grunting)

00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:17.465
I can't move!

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:18.033
Yeah, me too!

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.836
That light storm is twisting
the laws of physics inside out!

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:22.537
As far as I can tell,

00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:25.540
it's creating a gateway
to Barian World!

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.008
A gateway?

00:06:27.008 --> 00:06:29.210
So that's what
all this is about.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.379
The Barians must be trying
to connect

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:33.415
their world to our world.

00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:34.449
Yeah, totally!

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.985
It's lucky for you guys
I tracked you down.

00:06:36.985 --> 00:06:40.422
We can watch the
Barian-pocalypse together!

00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:42.490
(chuckling)

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.860
How did you manage to trace us
to this location, Heartland?

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.531
The Barians sent a bazillion
Numbers to this world,

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:52.133
and I zeroed in
on the one here.

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:52.534
Here?

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:56.404
These Barian Numbers can be
quite captivating.

00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:57.539
Humans find them irresistible.

00:06:57.772 --> 00:07:03.478
I mean, who can resist picking
up a powerful Number card?

00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:05.013
And once one's been picked up,

00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:07.549
I get to know exactly
who picked it up

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:10.885
That's how I found
you unfortunate fools.

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:12.554
Somebody here must
have picked up

00:07:12.554 --> 00:07:14.556
one of those Numbers recently!

00:07:14.556 --> 00:07:15.523
Okay, who is it?

00:07:15.523 --> 00:07:18.259
One of you found a Number
and lied about it!

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.528
I told you, I don't have one!

00:07:20.528 --> 00:07:22.530
Me either.
Or me!

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.531
(sighing anxiously)

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:26.201
Do you have one, Flip?

00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:33.108
Ugh.
Thanks a lot.

00:07:33.108 --> 00:07:34.542
But why, Flip?

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.945
When I saw it falling
from the sky,

00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.113
I just had to take it!

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:42.283
It's as if the card
was calling out to me.

00:07:42.283 --> 00:07:44.185
I didn't know it was evil!

00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:46.121
I didn't know it would
bring Heartland here!

00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:48.890
You would have picked
it up too, admit it!

00:07:49.057 --> 00:07:51.459
It's just, with
a powerful Number,

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:52.827
I thought I could help!

00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:55.797
Instead, I just made
things worse!

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:59.000
Speaking of worse,
the people of this world

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.536
are about to be absorbed
by Barian World.

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:04.172
Doesn't get much
worse than that, does it?

00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:05.807
(laughing)

00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:07.408
All those who picked up Numbers

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:10.278
will be transformed into
dark energy particles

00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:14.816
that will then be slurped up
by our newly-created gateway.

00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:16.284
The amassed energy will be used

00:08:16.284 --> 00:08:21.022
to allow Barian World
to consume this world!

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:23.825
Imagine, your world will
become just like

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:27.495
Barian World, and you'll
all be little Barian puppets.

00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:29.097
(shimmering, cracking)

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:29.764
You're the puppet!

00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:33.468
I bet the Barians haven't
even told you their endgame!

00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:35.003
Hmm, wanna bet?

00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:36.538
It's obvious where
this is going!

00:08:36.538 --> 00:08:39.107
The Barians want to drain
all power from this world

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:41.543
and use it to wipe
Astral World out of existence.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.845
That's what the Barians
are always up to.

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:45.547
Excuse me, I was talking!

00:08:45.547 --> 00:08:48.550
What we're really planning
is, uh, er...

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.351
pretty much what Kite said.

00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:51.553
(gasping)

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:52.453
(all gasping) No!

00:08:52.453 --> 00:08:54.255
Your little buddy's time is up

00:08:54.255 --> 00:08:56.524
but I promise
it's for the best.

00:08:56.524 --> 00:08:57.892
Ciao.

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:59.527
(all screaming) Oh!

00:08:59.527 --> 00:09:00.962
Flip, come back!

00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:01.362
Ah!

00:09:01.362 --> 00:09:04.065
(Flip)
Guys, what's goin' on?
Help me!

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:04.833
Keep it chill, guys.

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:08.536
Before you know it, you'll all
be assimilated in the same way.

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:10.271
It won't be too painful.

00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:11.406
And since you won't be needing

00:09:11.406 --> 00:09:12.540
your Numbers
where you're going,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.275
feel free to turn them all over

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:17.111
to your best bud,
Mr. Heartland.

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:20.882
If you want them, you'll
have to take them from us!

00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:21.983
If you insist.

00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:24.319
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:28.189
Go, Photon Transformation!

00:09:29.524 --> 00:09:32.393
It begins!
I once made you a Number Hunter,

00:09:32.393 --> 00:09:35.530
but now you're going to become
the hunted, Kite!

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:47.175
(both) Let's duel!

00:09:54.349 --> 00:09:56.551
(electricity crackling)

00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:02.090
(grunting)

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.525
This should jolt you
back to reality!

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:05.093
(laughing)

00:10:05.093 --> 00:10:08.830
Since this world is slowly
transforming into Barian World,

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.965
this duel will be just
like dueling

00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:12.166
in a Barian Sphere Field.

00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:15.536
So your mind and body are in for
quite the workout.

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:18.539
Trust me, this bout
will be much more painful

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:20.942
for you than for me.
(chuckling)

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:23.444
Why don't we let our cards do
the talking, Heartland?

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:27.415
In that case, my deck's going to
dominate the conversation.

00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:29.484
I'm volunteering
myself to go first!

00:10:29.484 --> 00:10:33.821
To get things rolling,
I'll summon Infection Fly!

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.259
(growling)

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.298
Then I'll play
the spell card Multifly!

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:45.166
This spell can draw in
more flies

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:47.402
than a trash dumpster
full of rotten eggs!

00:10:47.402 --> 00:10:52.040
So now I have a trio
of Infection Flies!

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:57.545
(both growling)

00:10:57.545 --> 00:11:00.448
Now to use its special ability!

00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:04.519
Infection Fly can double
the level of all my monsters.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.521
He has three of those
bugs on his field,

00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:10.058
so he can use that special
ability two more times!

00:11:10.058 --> 00:11:11.526
Exactamundo!

00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:14.295
My flies are all
abuzz with ability,

00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:17.932
so I can level them up
again and again!

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:20.201
(laughing)

00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.202
(grunting)

00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:22.537
The only thing more annoying

00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:24.472
than a bunch of bugs
is Heartland!

00:11:24.472 --> 00:11:26.808
You know what's coming next,
don't you, Kite?

00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:30.244
I'm overlaying
my three Infection Flies!

00:11:30.244 --> 00:11:32.413
Get buzzin', guys.

00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:33.181
With my fly guys,

00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:37.852
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:11:39.787 --> 00:11:43.491
Say hello to Number One!

00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:45.860
(laughing)

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.531
Behold the most freakishly
fabulous fly of them all!

00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:55.536
The king of the swarm,
Infection Buzzking!

00:11:56.237 --> 00:11:59.540
How did he get a Number?

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.377
(all gasping)

00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:07.015
(laughing)

00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:08.816
You're speechless that
I have Number One.

00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:12.854
But it makes complete sense,
since I'm number one too!

00:12:12.854 --> 00:12:15.556
More like a zero.

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:16.190
(grunting)

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.859
You better watch
what you say, mister,

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:20.528
or I'm gonna start losing
my temper!

00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:24.532
(chuckling) Excellent!

00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:27.168
Summoning Number One
is the first step

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:29.937
in our Barian takeover.
(chuckling)

00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:31.506
(Heartland)
In case you're
wondering, Kite,

00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:33.775
this is the strongest
Number of all!

00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:36.844
Your situation's hopeless,
so feel free

00:12:36.844 --> 00:12:38.546
to beg for leniency now.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.981
Not a chance.

00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:42.450
Oh, you're so uncooperative!

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.418
All right, then,

00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:44.552
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:47.221
Here goes!
My Infection Buzzking

00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:51.492
can dump one of your monsters
into the graveyard!

00:12:51.492 --> 00:12:53.294
And that's exactly what
I plan to do

00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:56.164
to a certain prized
Number you possess.

00:12:56.164 --> 00:12:57.365
What do you mean?

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:59.000
I'm referring to
the Number you took

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.538
from my partner, Scritch...
Ninja Shadow Mosquito!

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:05.373
Why'd you choose that one?

00:13:05.373 --> 00:13:07.075
There's no need to explain,

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:10.478
because you're about
to find out the hard way!

00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:14.949
(grunting)

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:18.319
Aah!

00:13:19.554 --> 00:13:20.555
What a bummer!

00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:22.523
Kite and his pals
thought they were hot stuff

00:13:22.523 --> 00:13:26.060
when they seized those Numbers
from Heartland's henchmen.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.797
What a shock to discover
those cards were fakes!

00:13:29.797 --> 00:13:31.332
These fake Barian cards

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:35.536
intensify the negative energy
of any Barian Field!

00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:37.472
(cackling)

00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:39.307
The damage will be devastating,

00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:41.542
even for someone
as tough as Kite!

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:44.545
(grunting)

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.280
(all gasping)

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.050
I scored a knock down!
(laughing)

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.552
(Kite)
(grunting)
What's going on?

00:13:51.552 --> 00:13:52.854
Why do I feel weak?

00:13:52.854 --> 00:13:55.256
It's only gonna get worse, pal!

00:13:55.256 --> 00:13:56.190
(shimmering) Oh!

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.025
Who's signaling me?
What?

00:13:58.025 --> 00:14:01.529
An urgent meeting for
all seven Barian Emperors?

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.330
(chuckling)

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.501
Now that you're worn down,
I'll let you take over.

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:09.804
It's brave of you to continue,

00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:11.539
but it isn't very wise.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:13.541
I'm determined to crush you.

00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:15.343
I'll stop at nothing to win,

00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:17.545
just like when I worked with
your father, Dr. Faker!

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:20.815
My father made some major
mistakes in his life.

00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:23.885
But getting mixed up with
a sleazeball like you...

00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:25.019
was his biggest!

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:26.053
(gasping)

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:27.555
Me, a sleazeball?

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.223
That's being generous.
Hyah!

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:34.462
I'm activating the Ritual Spell
Luminous Dragon Ritual!

00:14:34.462 --> 00:14:36.898
I like where this is going.
Whoa!

00:14:36.898 --> 00:14:38.366
If Kite's doing what I think,

00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:40.334
then he's about to try
a Ritual Summon.

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:42.770
I don't think this
has ever been done before!

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.206
He's taking a huge chance!

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.178
I'm tributing Level 4 Photon
Chargeman from my hand!

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:51.012
(grunting)

00:14:51.012 --> 00:14:54.549
Rise up, Paladin
of Photon Dragon!

00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:58.553
(beeping)

00:14:58.553 --> 00:15:01.022
But I'm not done because
I'm immediately tributing

00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:04.091
my Paladin of Photon Dragon,
leaving me free to summon

00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:07.929
my powerful Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon.

00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:11.899
Here comes the monster more
savage than a supernova...

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:14.468
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:15:15.303 --> 00:15:17.271
Time to attack,
Galaxy-Eyes.

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.540
Show that Buzzking
what you're made of!

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.209
(laughing)
What's the point, Kite?

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:24.212
Only a Number can destroy
another Number.

00:15:24.212 --> 00:15:26.013
Guess who knew that already?

00:15:26.013 --> 00:15:26.380
Yikes.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.483
Galaxy-Eyes's special
ability activates...

00:15:29.483 --> 00:15:32.420
and both our monsters
are banished!

00:15:33.854 --> 00:15:35.456
Wait, they're both banished?

00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:38.426
And since your Xyz
Monster's gone bye-bye,

00:15:38.426 --> 00:15:42.430
all its Overlay Units
go to the graveyard.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.265
Now that the battle's over,

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:47.201
both our monsters return
to the field.

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:50.538
But the best part's not
over yet, Heartland.

00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:53.140
My Dragon gains
500 attack points

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.477
for every Overlay Unit
your monster lost.

00:15:57.078 --> 00:15:58.546
And without its Overlay Units,

00:15:58.546 --> 00:16:00.448
your precious Number can't use

00:16:00.448 --> 00:16:03.284
its most powerful
special ability.

00:16:03.284 --> 00:16:05.553
Nooooooooo!

00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:08.556
Gotcha, didn't I?

00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:10.124
Huh?
Listen, Kite.

00:16:10.124 --> 00:16:13.427
Your Galaxy-Eyes won't
affect my strategy one bit.

00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:16.130
(scoffing) Duelists
have said that to me,

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.332
and they were always wrong!

00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:20.034
Your turn!

00:16:20.034 --> 00:16:23.871
Your dueling days
are numbered, Kite!

00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:28.142
Whoever called
this pow-wow

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:30.544
pulled me away from
important business!

00:16:30.544 --> 00:16:31.379
What's so serious

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:33.514
that you had to call
an emergency meeting

00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:36.017
of the imperial council?

00:16:36.017 --> 00:16:37.952
Huh?

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.821
Who's that?

00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:43.524
You don't recognize me, Vector?

00:16:43.524 --> 00:16:46.294
Huh?
Your voice sounds familiar.

00:16:46.294 --> 00:16:49.530
I'm hurt that you could
forget me so easily.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.533
No!
That couldn't be...

00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:53.234
Marin!

00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:56.470
If so, then
the other one must be...

00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:04.245
Oh!
Nash?

00:17:04.245 --> 00:17:06.147
But that's impossible!

00:17:08.983 --> 00:17:11.552
He's really alive?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.555
(chuckling) I draw!

00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:17.992
Your fate has already
been sealed, Kite!

00:17:17.992 --> 00:17:18.859
Don't believe me?

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:23.531
Then get a load of Buzzking...
(laughing)

00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:25.833
as it activates
its special ability!

00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:29.136
Once per turn, it can snatch
a Number from your graveyard

00:17:29.136 --> 00:17:31.205
and use it as an Overlay Unit!

00:17:31.205 --> 00:17:31.806
No way!

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:33.474
Your Shadow Mosquito will make

00:17:33.474 --> 00:17:37.278
a perfect Overlay Unit
for my Buzzking.

00:17:38.813 --> 00:17:40.548
(wincing)

00:17:40.548 --> 00:17:41.949
Oh, not feeling well?

00:17:41.949 --> 00:17:44.819
Best to rest, so I'll end this
as fast as I can.

00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:48.155
I activate another one of
Buzzking's special abilities!

00:17:48.155 --> 00:17:52.293
It uses an Overlay Unit to
destroy one card on your field.

00:17:52.293 --> 00:17:54.829
(beeping) (energy crackling)

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:55.329
But wait.

00:17:55.329 --> 00:17:58.199
If your destroyed card's a
monster, it gets even better!

00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:00.000
Because then you'll
be taking damage

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.503
equal to its attack points!

00:18:02.503 --> 00:18:03.938
Huh?
(laughing)

00:18:03.938 --> 00:18:07.541
That's why I've chosen
to destroy Galaxy-Eyes!

00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:08.309
No!

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.178
Kite will be hit with
4,500 points of damage!

00:18:11.178 --> 00:18:12.980
And he'll lose the duel!

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.148
Do something, Kite!

00:18:14.148 --> 00:18:16.851
No more life points for you!

00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:19.353
I'm activating a trap card.

00:18:19.353 --> 00:18:22.189
Prevent and Draw!

00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:24.492
Damage to me is cut in half!

00:18:24.492 --> 00:18:25.526
(energy crackling)

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.529
So your move won't be
enough to defeat me.

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:30.531
(shimmering)

00:18:38.305 --> 00:18:40.541
Aah!

00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:43.144
(grunting)

00:18:45.045 --> 00:18:46.947
Poor Master Kite!

00:18:46.947 --> 00:18:48.115
That card packs a punch!

00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:52.453
When it hits Kite full blast,
it's gonna crush him completely!

00:18:52.453 --> 00:18:53.554
Trey.
Quattro.

00:18:53.554 --> 00:18:57.258
If you have any Numbers from the
Barians, rip them up right now!

00:18:57.258 --> 00:18:59.960
They're dangerous!
(shimmering)

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.164
Huh?
Oh. Oh!

00:19:03.164 --> 00:19:05.266
(all shouting)

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:08.536
I hate to see Numbers
go to waste.

00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:11.238
If you don't want them,
I'll take them.

00:19:11.238 --> 00:19:12.940
(shimmering)

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.542
That's right!
Yes!

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:18.546
Give your power to me!
(grunting)

00:19:18.546 --> 00:19:20.548
(grunting)

00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:21.549
It's not over, Heartland.

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:25.252
Prevent and Draw let's me
draw one card from my deck.

00:19:25.252 --> 00:19:29.523
And I draw...
(groaning)

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:31.225
Kite, no!

00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:36.030
Looks like he's done, so that
means I'm... the winner!

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.432
(Yuma)
You're celebrating too soon!

00:19:38.432 --> 00:19:39.967
(all gasping)

00:19:39.967 --> 00:19:41.535
(all gasping)

00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:44.538
Could that really be Yuma?

00:19:46.006 --> 00:19:49.076
