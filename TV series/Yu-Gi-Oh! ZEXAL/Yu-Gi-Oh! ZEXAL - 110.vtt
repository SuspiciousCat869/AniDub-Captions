WEBVTT

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:07.409
Uhh!

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:11.913
The power of chaos is running
wild inside me!

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:12.447
Uhh!

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:16.151
It is trying to destroy me.

00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:18.853
Aah!

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.458
But I'll survive.

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:24.459
I have to.

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:28.430
To defeat Astral,
I'll endure anything.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.833
I have to make this power mine!

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:39.140
I've done it.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.343
Astral doesn't stand a chance.

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:44.779
I'm more powerful than Astral
ever imagined.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:51.853
In fact, I'm more powerful
than I ever imagined!

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:54.456
The numbers that were
at the seven ruins,

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:56.458
and the legends
we discovered there,

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:59.794
tell of the times when the seven
Barian emperors

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.029
were still human.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.430
In the final tale,
it was revealed to me

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:07.402
that both Shark and Rio played
a vital and important role.

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:11.106
I have no doubt in my mind
they'll...

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:13.441
I sense horror and despair.

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:17.445
It is coming from Astral World.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:26.755
Oh, no!

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.391
What's going on?

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:31.426
The sky is falling!

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:38.867
Who could be doing this?

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:44.839
Vector, number 96
is out of control.

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:45.774
What do you mean?

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:49.444
He is attacking Astral World
with such fury

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:51.346
that the dimensional shockwaves

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.215
are devastating
this world, too.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.253
Vector, seek him out.

00:01:58.253 --> 00:02:01.022
My power. Let's see...

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:02.057
Uhh!

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.126
I shall destroy everything...

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:07.162
everywhere!

00:02:07.162 --> 00:02:09.431

Yuma. Yuma!

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.068
Huh? Yeah?

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:21.836
Whoa!

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:26.441
Astral World is under attack
by a powerful

00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.442
yet unknown force.

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:30.945
Oh, no! What can we do
to stop it?

00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:32.714
The answer eludes me.

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:35.116
But the first step to solving
the problem

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.451
is finding the cause.

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:37.085
(explosion)

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:39.187
(man on TV)
<i>Dormant volcanoes are</i>
<i>now erupting,</i>

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.189
<i>and frigid weather</i>
<i>is wreaking havoc</i>

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.857
<i>in tropical regions</i>
<i>across the map,</i>

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:46.394
<i>as the sudden wave of global</i>
<i>disaster continues.</i>

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:47.996
<i>Unusually high tides...</i>

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:50.432
Eruptions?
Ice in the tropics?

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:52.801
There's got to be
some explanation.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:55.437
It's like the biggest
disaster ever.

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:57.038
What's like the biggest
disaster ever?

00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:59.441
The whole world's
in total crisis mode,

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.709
and you're clueless as usual.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.977
I have to do some reporting.

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:06.915
(man on TV)
Evacuations ordered by local,
national, and international...

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:07.382
Astral.

00:04:07.382 --> 00:04:10.385
Destructive events are
occurring in this world

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:11.719
and in Astral World.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.722
This is not coincidence.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.292
It must be number 96.

00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:20.128
Astral must already
feel my power.

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:22.130
He must be quaking in its wake.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.433
And soon, with all the power
I now wield,

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:28.102
I will absorb Astral
once and for all,

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:30.438
to erase him from existence.

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.345
Rio, I'm so confused.

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.281
Are we human?
Are we Barians?

00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:43.451
Who are we?

00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.787
Darkness.

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:46.855
Uh, Rio?

00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:49.457
Darkness is coming.

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:53.428
Yuma. Darkness.

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:54.429
All around.

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:56.431
What do you mean by darkness?

00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:00.368
The darkness is here.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.303
Yuma.

00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:06.407
I can't believe Rio's
still unconscious.

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.409
It's just horrible.

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.344
I know.

00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:10.011
It's the worst.

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.913
The last time she was
in the hospital,

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:13.915
she didn't wake up for,
like, forever.

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:16.451
I hope it's not as bad
as last time.

00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:18.286
I mean, we feel horrible.

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.355
Imagine how Shark must feel.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.458
I'm really worried about
how he's handling this.

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:24.826
You are?

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:25.894
Yeah.

00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:27.428
He's been acting really strange

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:30.865
ever since he dueled
against Abyss.

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.433
Yuma.
Huh?

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:34.769
I suspect Shark will
at some point

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.438
explain to you what
is troubling him.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:40.141
Yeah? What makes you
say that?

00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:42.443
If he has not
spoken to you yet,

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:46.281
it would not be wise for me
to speak on his behalf.

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.249
I don't understand it.

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.451
Shark's hiding something
from me?

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:53.388
I wish he knew
he could tell me anything.

00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:55.990
Perhaps he would keep
certain knowledge from you

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.993
if he thought that knowledge
would scare you away.

00:05:58.993 --> 00:05:59.427
That must be it!

00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.430
He's scared that I'll
turn my back on him!

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:05.733
Of course.

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:06.434
Huh?

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:08.770
(Yuma) It's Shark.

00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:11.839
Yuma!

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.074
Hey, Shark.

00:06:13.074 --> 00:06:14.108
Are you all right?

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:16.177
Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:17.445
Huh?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.415
Uhh!

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:22.450
Tori, what's wrong?

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.851
(gasps)

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.787
Yuma, look up.

00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:26.721
Huh?

00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:30.458
(Yuma)
Whoa! What's that?

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:32.427
It is him.

00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:35.730
(sinister laugh)

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:39.434
The power number 96 possesses

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:44.339
is unlike anything we have
ever faced before.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.141
(sinister laugh)

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.675
Master Kite,

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:52.280
there is a massive
gravitational shift
at point B-332.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.715
Great.

00:06:57.452 --> 00:07:00.054
(sinister laugh)

00:07:04.092 --> 00:07:05.960
Master Kite,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.130
my stabilizers are
de-de-destabilizing.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.431
Uhh!

00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.134
(sinister laugh)

00:07:18.402 --> 00:07:19.836
Huh? Huh?

00:07:19.836 --> 00:07:22.506
Where are we?

00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.574
Yuma!

00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:25.409
You okay?

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.845
Kite! How'd you get here?

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:30.247
Beats me.

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:33.550
And where is here?

00:07:36.853 --> 00:07:39.389
(sinister laugh)

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.425
Well, look who it is.

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:43.827
Yuma and Astral.

00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:47.064
Number 96!

00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:50.434
(sinister laugh)

00:07:50.434 --> 00:07:53.303
I see you've brought some
friends along for the fun.

00:07:53.303 --> 00:07:56.840
Though I didn't invite you,
you're welcome to stay.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.843
I'll take your numbers
and dispose of you.

00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:01.845
But you'll have to
wait your turn.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:03.447
My deductions were correct.

00:08:03.447 --> 00:08:07.217
You are the one causing
havoc in both our worlds.

00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:09.820
Yes, I am.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.788
Look.

00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:18.662
And I'm not just destroying
your world.

00:08:18.662 --> 00:08:19.830
My unrelenting power

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.798
is devastating
Barian world as well.

00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:24.835
You are trying to destroy
all our worlds?

00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:25.602
That's right.

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:28.238
When I'm through,
there'll be nothing left.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:30.107
Why would you do that?

00:08:30.107 --> 00:08:32.742
Because I can.

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:35.679
Too bad you won't be around

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.547
to see the end of everything.

00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:39.850
Ugh. This guy
means business.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:41.251
(chuckles)

00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:42.853
Shall we get started?

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:45.722
I've been looking forward
to our rematch.

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:49.693
Now say good-bye
to your friends.

00:08:49.693 --> 00:08:52.162
Aagghh!

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:56.433
Oh, no.

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:59.703
(Kite)
That's a Barian sphere field.

00:08:59.703 --> 00:09:03.373
The danger of this duel
has increased exponentially.

00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:04.774
That's correct.

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:06.676
Aren't you a clever one.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.379
I can do anything in here.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:11.515
Here's a taste.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.850
Aah! Aah!

00:09:14.084 --> 00:09:15.552
Yuma! Astral!

00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:17.854
I am invincible here.

00:09:18.088 --> 00:09:19.322
Unstoppable.

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:20.223
You have no hope.

00:09:20.223 --> 00:09:23.627
All that's left for you
is despair.

00:09:23.627 --> 00:09:27.797
(thinking)
This field could hold
the ultimate defeat...

00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:31.535
for me and for Yuma.

00:09:32.836 --> 00:09:36.840
We must not lose.

00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:42.145
Shall we high-five the sky?

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:42.846
Yeah!

00:09:42.846 --> 00:09:45.448
Get ready!

00:09:45.448 --> 00:09:47.651
Uhh! Uhh!

00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:49.352
Let's do this!

00:09:49.352 --> 00:09:50.820
Uhh!

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.823
Duel disc... go!

00:09:53.823 --> 00:09:56.826
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:09:56.826 --> 00:10:00.697
(computer)
Augmented reality vision
link established.

00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:02.534
Duel!
Duel!

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:05.528
Good luck, you two,

00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:06.830
and trust me when I say

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.466
you're definitely
going to need it.

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:10.533
It's my move.

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:12.035
I draw!

00:10:12.035 --> 00:10:15.772
I summon Malicevorous Spoon!

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:21.544
Now I'll send
Malicevorous Knife

00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:24.080
from my hand to the graveyard

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.517
to summon Malicevorous Fork!

00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:31.187
And with that, the table has
been set for my next move.

00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:35.926
I activate Malicevorous Spoon's
special ability.

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.461
Now I can really
sharpen my game,

00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.164
because I can summon
Malicevorous Knife

00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:43.867
from the graveyard!

00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:46.303
He did the same thing
when we dueled him

00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:47.170
at the underground temple.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:53.443
I open my level to Malicevorous
Spoon, Knife, and Fork.

00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:55.412
With these three monsters,

00:10:55.412 --> 00:10:57.180
I build the overlay network

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.385
and exceed summon
Number 96, Dark Mist.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:13.530
And now you will feel
my almighty power.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.131
I activate the spell.

00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:16.533
Rank-Up-Magic Barian's force.

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:22.539
Ready yourselves, for this
will be your final battle.

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:29.546
I overlay two Dark Mists.

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:34.384
With this one monster,
I rebuild the overlay network.

00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:37.454
Go, Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:43.460
Appear, Chaos number 96,
Dark Storm!

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:55.538
As you can see, your future's
looking stormy,

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:58.541
and the forecast will
only get worse.

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.344
Now, the question is
how much worse?

00:12:01.344 --> 00:12:04.547
Summoning a Chaos Xyz monster
that quickly

00:12:04.547 --> 00:12:06.516
must be key to his strategy.

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.885
Think before you duel, Yuma.

00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:10.186
I sure will.

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:11.521
My turn!

00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:14.524
I draw!

00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:15.892
Here goes.

00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:19.262
I summon Gogogo Golam.

00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:26.036
Yuma, summon your
Doggy Diver next.

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:27.537
That's what I was thinking.

00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:33.843
Okay, I summon Doggy Diver
in attack mode.

00:12:37.547 --> 00:12:39.082
With that pooch out there,

00:12:39.082 --> 00:12:40.183
they can really sick it to him.

00:12:40.183 --> 00:12:45.522
Now I overlay level four
Gogogo Golam and Doggy Diver.

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:50.226
With these new monsters,
I build the overlay network.

00:12:50.226 --> 00:12:55.532
I exceed summon number 39,
Utopia!

00:13:00.537 --> 00:13:02.405
Okay.

00:13:02.405 --> 00:13:04.140
Aah!

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.541
Yuma?

00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:07.177
Uhh! Don't worry,
I'm good.

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:10.380
(thinking)
And it's I get even better.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.348
You racked up your monster.

00:13:12.348 --> 00:13:16.152
Well, guess what? So can I.

00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:19.522
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Numeron Force,

00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:23.526
so I can Rank-Up-Utopia into
a Chaos Xyz monster.

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:28.898
I rebuild the overlay network
with Utopia!

00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:31.334
Go, Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:13:31.334 --> 00:13:38.541
Come on out, Chaos number 39,
Utopia Ray Victory!

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:55.892
Number 96 seems quite
unconcerned.

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:57.093
Yeah, well, he will be

00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:59.529
when Numeron Force's other
effect activates.

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:02.132
All other face-up cards
on the field

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.534
lose their effects this turn.

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:06.536
Too bad, but Dark Storm
can't use

00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:08.938
any of its special
abilities now.

00:14:08.938 --> 00:14:12.175
(sinister laugh)

00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:13.910
Hey, what's so funny?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.213
How perfectly you've
fallen into my trap,

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:19.082
just as I knew you would.

00:14:19.082 --> 00:14:20.517
Yeah? What trap?

00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:23.520
It's a little something I call
Chaos Bringer.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.522
When you summon
a Chaos monster,

00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:31.194
all its overlay units get sent
straight to the graveyard.

00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:34.531
Oh. What am I going
to do without them?

00:14:34.764 --> 00:14:38.201
Then I get to choose one field
spell from my deck

00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:40.837
and add it directly to my hand.

00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:42.539
I select Chaos Field.

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:45.408
What is he playing?

00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:46.142
Ugghh.

00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:47.810
And last but not least,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.548
Chaos Bringer won't let your
Utopia Ray Victory

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:55.385
attack me this turn.

00:14:55.385 --> 00:14:57.387
Great!

00:14:57.387 --> 00:14:59.522
Yuma, remain calm and focus.

00:14:59.522 --> 00:15:04.494
All right. I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:15:04.494 --> 00:15:06.529
Then it's my move, Yuma.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:08.798
I know this duel is already
tough for you,

00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:10.500
but I'm going to make it
even tougher.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.835
How can this become
more challenging?

00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:18.107
I activate the Field Spell
Chaos Field.

00:15:21.044 --> 00:15:22.512
Aah!

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:26.849
By sending the Chaos overlay
unit to the graveyard,

00:15:26.849 --> 00:15:29.085
one random number card
in your deck

00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:31.521
not only loses its
special abilities,

00:15:31.754 --> 00:15:35.258
but it is summoned
onto my field.

00:15:35.258 --> 00:15:38.094
(sinister laugh)

00:15:38.094 --> 00:15:40.029
Leave my numbers alone!

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:40.496
Aah!

00:15:40.496 --> 00:15:45.001
No, Yuma, I don't think
that I will.

00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:46.135
Uhh!

00:15:46.135 --> 00:15:48.104
The end is near, Yuma.

00:15:48.104 --> 00:15:52.242
I send Dark Storm's chaos
overlay unit to the graveyard

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.877
to take your number.

00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:56.846
(sinister laugh)

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.315
Uhh!

00:16:04.187 --> 00:16:06.823
Check it out, Yuma.

00:16:06.823 --> 00:16:07.523
Ha!

00:16:07.523 --> 00:16:12.061
It's number 69,
Heraldry Crest.

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:23.139
That was Vetrix's
most powerful monster.

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:26.843
Number 96 is going to take
all of Yuma's numbers

00:16:26.843 --> 00:16:27.977
one by one.

00:16:27.977 --> 00:16:29.846
No, he can't!

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:31.514
The fun's just starting.

00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:35.018
I activate Chaos Field's
additional effect.

00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:35.785
Say what?

00:16:35.785 --> 00:16:37.854
I evolved the number
I took from you

00:16:37.854 --> 00:16:41.224
into a Chaos number
that's one rank higher.

00:16:41.224 --> 00:16:42.358
Astral!

00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:42.925
Prepare yourself.

00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:44.294
(Astral)
The nature of this duel

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.429
is about to become
much more extreme.

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:50.533
I rebuild the overlay network
with Heraldry Crest!

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:53.336
Go! Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:57.540
I summon Chaos number 69,

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.010
Heraldry Crest of Horror.

00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:10.420
Astral, we're in trouble,
big time!

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.417
Oh!

00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:15.958
Astral, we're in trouble,
big time!

00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.594
You have no idea
how right you are.

00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:22.297
I activate Crest of Horror
special ability!

00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:25.300
By using one
Chaos overlay unit,

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.602
Heraldry Crest of Horror

00:17:26.835 --> 00:17:29.605
gains Utopia Ray Victory's
attack points

00:17:29.605 --> 00:17:32.174
and special abilities.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.247
Astral, if I take
this attack, I lose.

00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:40.549
No, Yuma, we lose.

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:41.583
Uhh! Uhh!

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:43.986
Boys, it's all over for you!

00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:50.359
Heraldry Crest of Horrors,
attack Utopia Ray Victory.

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:53.095
You need to activate a trap.

00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:53.595
Right.

00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:58.200
I activate number Spellcaster.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.601
By attributing the number
of my field,

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:03.605
I can pick a spell that's
in my deck and activate it.

00:18:03.605 --> 00:18:06.508
Yuma, you know
what you must do.

00:18:06.508 --> 00:18:07.910
I'm on it.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.313
I tribute Utopia Ray Victory.

00:18:12.614 --> 00:18:17.453
Then let's reactivate the spell
Swords of Burning Light.

00:18:17.453 --> 00:18:20.189
When I don't have any
monsters on my field,

00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:23.225
your monsters can't attack.

00:18:27.362 --> 00:18:28.063
(chuckles)

00:18:28.063 --> 00:18:30.165
I have to give you credit
for that move,

00:18:30.165 --> 00:18:32.968
though it won't help you
escape your fate.

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:36.104
I wonder what you can do next.

00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:37.372
That was a smart play.

00:18:37.372 --> 00:18:42.878
Yeah, but I don't see how
they can get out of this one.

00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:44.346
Get ready.

00:18:44.346 --> 00:18:46.114
Aah!

00:18:46.114 --> 00:18:48.050
I draw!

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.218
(thinking) Perfect.

00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:52.488
You must be cautious
and assess the situation.

00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:53.355
You're right.

00:18:53.355 --> 00:18:56.592
I face a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:18:56.592 --> 00:18:58.594
What's the point?

00:18:58.827 --> 00:19:01.897
There's no way you can stop me.

00:19:01.897 --> 00:19:03.599
Time to show you why!

00:19:03.832 --> 00:19:06.468
I activate Chaos Field's
effect.

00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:10.539
I send Dark Storm's Chaos
overlay unit to the graveyard

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:13.442
so that I can steal another
one of your numbers.

00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:18.413
I wonder which one
it will be this time.

00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:24.286
Are you ready for the big
reveal, Yuma?

00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:28.390
Well, here it is in
all its glory.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.493
Come on out, number 92,

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:35.097
Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:19:39.167 --> 00:19:40.235
(sinister laugh)

00:19:40.235 --> 00:19:42.971
You two know what happens now,
don't you?

00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:46.942
Chaos field evolves number 92
into a Chaos number.

00:19:46.942 --> 00:19:52.214
I rebuild the overlay network
with Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:56.585
Go, Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:19:56.585 --> 00:20:00.088
I summon Chaos number 92,

00:20:00.088 --> 00:20:04.359
Heart-Earth Chaos Dragon!

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.874
Oh, man, this just went
from worse to worser.

00:20:18.874 --> 00:20:19.308
So true.

00:20:19.308 --> 00:20:23.111
I activate Heart-Earth Chaos
Dragon's special ability.

00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:25.213
By using one Chaos
overlay unit,

00:20:25.213 --> 00:20:27.849
all your monsters, traps,
and spell effects

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:30.852
are rendered useless until
the end of the turn.

00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:34.022
Oh, and don't think your
facedown cards will save you,

00:20:34.022 --> 00:20:37.159
because you're not allowed
to activate them either.

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:40.896
And that means you have
no defenses left.

00:20:40.896 --> 00:20:45.467
Astral, Yuma, this is the end!

00:20:45.467 --> 00:20:48.437
