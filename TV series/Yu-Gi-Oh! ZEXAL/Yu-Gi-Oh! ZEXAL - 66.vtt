WEBVTT

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.720
(Yuma)
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:05.421
(Mr. Heartland)
<i>This final, championship
battle</i>

00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:10.121
<i>will take place in the
revolutionary new Sphere Field.</i>

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:12.587
And you can rest assured that
this Sphere Field

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.921
will be an experience
that is out of this world.

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:18.654
Whenever you use Numbers,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.087
the Sphere Field will absorb
the power they generate.

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:28.587
All right, I'‘m ready.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:29.987
(both)
Let's duel.

00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:32.321
I summon
Number 10!

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:34.921
Illumiknight!

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:36.921
Illumiknight.

00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:39.087
That was
Kite's Number.

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:44.554
I overlay Level 4 Heraldic Beast
Aberconway and Leo.

00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:46.587
I summon Number 30!

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:48.987
Acid Golem of Destruction!

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.454
Now I summon
Number 8!

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.654
Heraldic King
Genom-Heritage!

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:00.194
Now he has
three Numbers.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.361
My turn.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:06.427
Appear, Number 34...
Terror-Byte.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:08.827
Now I summon
Number 17...

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:11.161
Leviathan Dragon.

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:16.027
Come on out
Number 39: Utopia.

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:21.527
(Mr. Heartland)
<i>Each duelist has summoned three
powerful Numbers.</i>

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:24.394
<i>Whom will
lady luck smile upon today?</i>

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:28.827
<i>It's down to the wire and these
duelists are on fire.</i>

(Vetrix)
Three monsters,
I'm impressed, Yuma.

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.834
Maybe you're finally
getting lucky.

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:41.101
I don't have to get lucky
I have skill on my side.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:43.001
We can win
this battle, Yuma.

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:44.734
Now make your move quickly.

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.567
Right.

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.467
I activate Leviathan Dragon's
special ability.

00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:52.967
I'll use one Overlay Unit to
give it a 500 point power-up.

00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:57.701
Go get him,
Leviathan Dragon!

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:00.841
Attack Illumiknight with
Sonic Shredding Stream!

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:13.074
And I'm not done yet.

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:16.007
Now go, Utopia!

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:17.907
Attack Genom-Heritage.

00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:20.741
Rising Sun Slash!

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:36.507
So you destroyed
one monster, so what?

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:40.141
I still have my Acid Golem
on my field

00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.007
and it has 3000 attack points.

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.207
Yeah?

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:46.974
Not anymore!

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:50.374
I activate the spell
XYZ Triangle Force.

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.574
When I have at
least three XYZ Monsters,

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:55.641
I can destroy one card
on your field.

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:04.447
All right, time
to take out Acid Golem.

00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:13.014
Maybe I underestimated you,
Yuma.

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:14.414
You think?

00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:17.781
'Cause without any Number Cards,
there's no way you can beat me.

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:20.814
In the end, Yuma
could actually pull this out.

00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:23.114
Vetrix's got no cards
left in his hand.

00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:26.447
No facedown cards either,
so Yuma's got this in the bag.

00:04:26.514 --> 00:04:28.414
Yeah, Yuma'‘s
gonna win it.

00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.914
You did it,
nice job.

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.514
My turn is finished,
Vetrix.

00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:38.081
And soon you
will be, too.

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:40.314
Oh, come on now.

00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:43.547
You don't seriously think
you can beat me, do you, Yuma?

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:45.381
You bet I do.

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:47.647
I'm gonna beat you
for what you did to Hart

00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:49.981
and for what you
did to Kite.

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:52.081
Well, I'm afraid I'm
going to have to disappoint

00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:53.347
all three of you.

00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:55.247
You see, Yuma your
three monsters

00:04:55.314 --> 00:04:57.547
can't come close
to defeating me.

00:04:57.614 --> 00:04:59.347
What... why?

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:01.887
Because your deck
is no match for mine.

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:04.554
Now it's my turn to
feel the flow.

00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.354
I'm just kidding.

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.287
It's my move!

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:14.421
I banish Heraldic Beast Unicorn
from my graveyard!

00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:17.687
That lets me summon one
XYZ Monster from my graveyard

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:20.554
even though it loses its
special abilities.

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:24.054
I summon Illumiknight!

00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:30.521
And now I banish another
Heraldic Beast Unicorn

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:34.621
from my graveyard
to summon Genom-Heritage!

00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:42.087
It doesn't make
a difference, Vetrix.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:45.354
My monsters have way more
attack points than yours do.

00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:48.187
Unfortunately for us I do not
believe his intention

00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:50.821
is to attack with
the monsters he has resurrected.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:51.887
What?

00:05:51.954 --> 00:05:53.321
If attacking were
his goal,

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.687
Vetrix would
have chosen Acid Golem

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.487
because it has the most
attack points.

00:05:58.554 --> 00:06:04.194
Now I activate
the spell card Heraldry Reborn!

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.561
This brings back a Level 4
or below Heraldic Beast

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:10.194
from my graveyard.

00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:13.861
Come on out Heraldic Beast
Berners Falcon!

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:26.294
I activate Berners Falcon's
special ability.

00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:31.594
I can make all monsters on
my field have the same Level.

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:41.461
XYZ Monsters with Levels.

00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:44.227
Now Vetrix has three
Level 4 monsters.

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:45.661
Not good.

00:06:45.727 --> 00:06:47.594
I overlay Illumiknight,

00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:51.427
Genom-Heritage
and Berners Falcon!

00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:00.734
With these three monsters,

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.367
I build
the Overlay Network.

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:06.867
I XYZ Summon Number 69.

00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:09.101
Heraldry Crest!

00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:29.634
I was afraid he would
summon this Number, Yuma.

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.001
You guys,
that's the Number

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:37.534
that defeated Kite's
Neo Galaxy-Eyes.

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:39.201
Oh no.

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:45.534
This Number is a symbol.

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:50.034
A symbol of Vetrix's thirst
for vengeance.

00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:53.301
Ah, the mighty
Heraldry Crest.

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:57.334
You're face to face
with defeat, Yuma.

00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:01.474
You may as well come
face to face with me!

00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:07.374
Oh, my word.

00:08:10.707 --> 00:08:12.474
Byron.

00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:31.087
Your-- your face.

00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:32.387
Yes.

00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:35.254
While I was wandering through
the chasm between dimensions

00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:39.121
I experienced this interesting
transformation.

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:42.487
So while my heart
is filled with vengeance,

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:45.687
my poor face looks
rather empty.

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:48.021
Yuma, it is clear from
his appearance

00:08:48.087 --> 00:08:51.394
that Vetrix's spirit
is no longer fully human.

00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:53.227
(laughing)

00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:57.461
(woman)
How did they
do that?

00:08:57.527 --> 00:08:58.327
(man)
This is awesome.

00:08:58.394 --> 00:08:59.694
(woman)Amazing.

00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:02.161
They saved the coolest special
effects for the finals.

00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:04.594
Yo guys, that's
not special effects.

00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:05.894
You're right,
Bronk.

00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:07.761
That's what Vetrix
really looks like.

00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:09.527
Yuma, run away.

00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:11.194
(Tori)
Yuma's not a
quitter.

00:09:11.261 --> 00:09:13.694
And the least we can do

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:16.194
is let him know
we won't quit on him either.

00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.327
Yuma, we're with you!

00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:21.361
Yuma and Astral...

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.227
behold my power!

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:28.094
This is the greatest, most
powerful Number that I possess.

00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:30.527
Allow me to explain
why.

00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:33.827
First off, you can't
use any card effects

00:09:33.894 --> 00:09:36.061
to destroy Heraldry Crest.

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.861
But not only that.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:43.461
It also negates and steals your
monsters' special abilities.

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:46.827
Wait, it can use my
monsters' special abilities?

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:49.861
That's right, Yuma, so no matter
what monsters you have

00:09:49.927 --> 00:09:52.367
they're powerless
against Heraldry Crest.

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:55.834
And now I'll prove your
father's high ideals

00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:58.401
are just as
worthless as you are.

00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:03.367
Heraldry Crest's special ability
activates... Whipping Lash!

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:26.134
(Astral)
He has stolen Leviathan Dragon's
special ability.

00:10:26.201 --> 00:10:29.434
Now for a bitter taste
of your own medicine.

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:32.267
I activate its
newest ability.

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:35.067
By using one Overlay Unit,
my Heraldry Crest

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.101
gains 500 attack points
thanks to Leviathan Dragon.

00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:46.001
Now I banish Heraldic Beast Leo
from my graveyard

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:48.401
to activate its
special ability.

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:49.967
Your monster loses
attack points

00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:53.841
equal to the change in
my monster's attack points.

00:10:57.641 --> 00:10:59.641
That's 500 attack points.

00:10:59.707 --> 00:11:01.941
Now do it!

00:11:02.007 --> 00:11:04.641
Destroy Leviathan Dragon.

00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:08.107
Dark Matter Demolition!

00:11:25.307 --> 00:11:28.574
That Number you used is
incredibly powerful.

00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:30.841
I'm impressed, Byron.

00:11:30.907 --> 00:11:34.307
Your thirst for vengeance
is even greater than I thought.

00:11:34.374 --> 00:11:35.607
Ohh...

00:11:35.674 --> 00:11:37.407
Can you go on, Yuma?

00:11:37.474 --> 00:11:39.307
Yeah, I'‘m
just fine.

00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:41.474
Liar.

00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:44.274
Why not be smart
and give up while you can?

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:47.174
I'm not like Trey or Quattro
or Quinton, Yuma.

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:48.907
I'm invincible.

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.414
The power difference between
Heraldry Crest and you

00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:52.647
is like the difference

00:11:52.714 --> 00:11:55.547
between the power of
a parent and a child.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:59.147
Yeah, you would say that
because you're a monster too

00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:01.147
just like
Heraldry Crest is.

00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:02.981
What?

00:12:03.047 --> 00:12:04.681
I finally get
it now.

00:12:04.747 --> 00:12:08.981
Quattro and Trey
and even Quinton too.

00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:11.181
They were all great,
they were awesome.

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:13.414
They fought hard
to support themselves.

00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.081
They fought even harder to
be there for each other.

00:12:16.147 --> 00:12:19.414
And to the end, they
were all concerned about you.

00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:23.514
But still, there's one thing
I don't get.

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:26.881
Why they threw everything
away for someone who's nothing.

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.781
You think they owed you their
lives because they're your kids

00:12:31.847 --> 00:12:33.481
but you're wrong.

00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:35.647
They had
complete faith in you.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.514
They hoped you'd become a
regular dad again someday.

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:40.014
Yuma.

00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:43.214
When you came back why
couldn't you do that for them?

00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:45.881
Why couldn't you try
to be a father

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.614
instead of just
trying to get revenge?

00:12:50.747 --> 00:12:54.354
It isn't possible for a child
like you to understand.

00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:57.787
I do understand.

00:12:57.854 --> 00:13:01.421
I understand exactly what it
feels like to lose a father.

00:13:01.487 --> 00:13:03.887
And I guarantee that's
the feeling your sons had

00:13:03.954 --> 00:13:06.921
when you went away.

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:11.054
But the sad truth is you
just didn't care, did you?

00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:12.321
Be quiet.

00:13:12.387 --> 00:13:15.354
How dare you talk
to me that way.

00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:18.821
Well, I care about
this duel, Vetrix.

00:13:18.887 --> 00:13:21.887
And I'm gonna fight for Quattro
and Trey and Quinton.

00:13:21.954 --> 00:13:23.887
You throw
whatever you got at me,

00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:25.887
but I'm never gonna
quit on them.

00:13:25.954 --> 00:13:27.654
We'll see.

00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:30.821
You'll be crushed by
Heraldry Crest soon enough.

00:13:30.887 --> 00:13:33.387
So for now I'll just
end my turn.

00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:36.154
Astral, there's
only one way to win.

00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:37.721
You mean...

00:13:37.787 --> 00:13:39.487
That's right, Astral.

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:42.754
Our only chance to beat him
is with the power of Zexal.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.687
All right, it is time

00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:47.187
for you and I to build
the Overlay Network.

00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:51.460
(both)
Go Zexal Morph.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.627
(Astral)
When two distant
souls become one

00:14:15.694 --> 00:14:18.894
the power of Zexal
is revealed!

00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:39.861
What is Zexal?

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.868
(man)
What's with
the costume change?

00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:53.834
Zexal-- that's the power of
the bond between Yuma and Astral

00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.134
How's Yuma gonna explain this
when the duel's over?

00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.601
Your guess is
as good as mine.

00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:03.434
Maybe the crowd thinks
it's virtual reality?

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.068
Well real or virtual, Yuma
looks totally amazing.

00:15:07.134 --> 00:15:09.001
(woman)
And he's an
amazing duelist.

00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:10.468
(woman)
I hope he wins.

00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:12.301
(woman 3)
Let's make sure
he knows it.

00:15:12.368 --> 00:15:14.601
(crowd chanting)
Go Yuma, Go Yuma.

00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:18.868
Go Yuma, Go Yuma, Go Yuma...

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:21.968
Hey, the crowd's
really with him.

00:15:22.034 --> 00:15:25.668
Yuma, everybody is cheering for
you and Astral to win

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:27.268
so don't you let us down.

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:29.601
(crowd)
Go Yuma, Go Yuma,

00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:32.668
Go Yuma, Go Yuma,

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:35.334
Go Yuma, Go Yuma...

00:15:40.434 --> 00:15:42.201
My, my, I wonder
if you two

00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:45.308
have any other
surprises in store for me.

00:15:45.374 --> 00:15:47.274
What now, Astral?

00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:50.408
(Astral)
I suggest we focus on
the duel, Yuma.

00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:53.408
Yeah, well, that's what
I was just gonna suggest.

00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:57.474
My turn, I draw.

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.108
Yuma, you know what you must
do now don't you?

00:16:00.174 --> 00:16:01.974
You better
believe I do.

00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:04.574
Go Chaos XYZ Evolution!

00:16:07.741 --> 00:16:12.808
Appear, Chaos Number 39
Utopia Ray.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.908
Your Utopia Ray
is very nice, Yuma,

00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:28.974
but it can't change
things.

00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:34.408
I activate Heraldry Crest's
special ability Whipping Lash.

00:16:34.474 --> 00:16:36.241
Now I'll take your
special abilities

00:16:36.308 --> 00:16:39.708
and make them
my own, Utopia Ray.

00:16:39.774 --> 00:16:41.008
I won't let you.

00:16:41.074 --> 00:16:44.081
I activate the spell card
Seven Store.

00:16:44.148 --> 00:16:47.148
With Seven Store,
by tributing one XYZ Monster,

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:49.114
we get to draw one card.

00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:51.848
I select Terror-Byte.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.548
Next, I get
to draw a card

00:16:56.614 --> 00:17:00.914
for every Overlay Unit
that Terror-Byte had.

00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:03.581
Because Terror-Byte
had two Overlay Units,

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.614
I get to draw a total
of three cards now.

00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:09.914
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:13.148
He can even generate the very
card that he needs to draw.

00:17:13.214 --> 00:17:15.814
Let's do it, Astral.

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:18.814
(both)
Go Shining Draw.

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:22.281
Perfect.

00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:26.081
Heraldry Crest can steal Yuma's
monster's special abilities

00:17:26.148 --> 00:17:28.348
but it cannot
steal the powers of cards

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:31.181
that are equipped to it.

00:17:31.248 --> 00:17:34.314
Very clever,
quite ingenious.

00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:40.014
Now I equip Utopia Ray with
Zexal Weapon-Lightning Blade.

00:17:40.081 --> 00:17:43.388
Utopia Ray gains
1200 attack points.

00:17:46.854 --> 00:17:48.154
Not only that,

00:17:48.221 --> 00:17:51.688
you can no longer destroy
Yuma's spell and trap cards.

00:18:04.154 --> 00:18:07.021
Go, Utopia Ray!

00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:09.521
Lightning Blade Strike!

00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:20.854
As I expected.

00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:23.288
But I'm afraid all
I have to do to stop you

00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:26.554
is activate Heraldry Crest's
special ability!

00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:30.654
I can use one Overlay Unit
to destroy a card on the field

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:34.288
and I choose Utopia Ray!

00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:38.421
No.

00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:40.154
Oh yes!

00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:44.228
Now I'll show you
the true power of my Number.

00:18:45.328 --> 00:18:47.161
Go, Heraldry Crest!

00:18:47.228 --> 00:18:49.794
Shatter Stream!

00:18:59.626 --> 00:19:03.126
(Vetrix)
Go, Shatter Stream!

00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:04.459
Ha, don'‘t think so.

00:19:04.526 --> 00:19:07.193
I activate
Lightning Blade's effect.

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:09.193
By returning Lightning Blade
to my hand,

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:11.693
Utopia Ray
avoids destruction.

00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:17.193
Nice stalling tactic

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:20.159
but it isn't going to stop
the inevitable, Yuma.

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:23.159
Utopia Ray is finished.

00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:25.393
Destroy it,
Heraldry Crest!

00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:29.259
Crush Utopia Ray!

00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:32.793
From the graveyard I activate
Bacon Saver's special ability.

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:34.133
What's that do?

00:19:34.199 --> 00:19:37.899
By banishing Bacon Saver,
Utopia Ray avoids destruction,

00:19:37.966 --> 00:19:40.733
and Yuma does not take
any damage.

00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:00.933
You are the pig,
Bacon Saver.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:02.999
What a lame maneuver.

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:06.533
I can't believe you had that
horrible hog in your graveyard.

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:10.399
Utopia Ray once again equips
Lightning Blade!

00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:27.066
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:20:33.773 --> 00:20:36.139
You're resilient
like your father, Yuma.

00:20:36.206 --> 00:20:39.506
It's a trait you both share
with cockroaches.

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:41.673
You can insult
my father and me

00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:44.473
but know that no matter
what you say or do,

00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:48.273
you can never
make us give up!
