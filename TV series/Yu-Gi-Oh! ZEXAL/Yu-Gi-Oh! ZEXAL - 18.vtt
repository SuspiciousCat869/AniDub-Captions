WEBVTT

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.630
Yuma: Last time
on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.190
CATHY: Yuma!

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.190
Cat!?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.830
you have to do something!

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.190
It's Tori and the others, they!

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.830
They what? Cat!

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.230
FORTUNO: Cat cannot hear
you right now.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.660
Wha?!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.830
my name is fortuno. I am a seer
of all things and I bring to you

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.430
a message on behalf
of my master, Kite.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890
Kite?

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.890
We have your friends, yuma, if
you want to see them again, you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.290
must come to my
mansion and duel me.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.890
I xyz summon,
number 16: Shock master

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.630
that thing is freaky looking!

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.960
Shock master take
out gogogo golem!

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.230
Your friends' safety depends
on you. The more life

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.490
points you lose, the
more the rock on

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.690
Which they stand will crumble.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.760
Not cool!

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
Astral: This trembling in my
spirit, I think I now understand

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.690
what it means to be afraid.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.130

Ha ha! I see the end! You're
kneeling before me!

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.130
You're admitting defeat and
you're begging me to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.590
release your little friends!

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.960
Ah, bronk Tori

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.660
TORI: Yuma

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.460
don't worry guys. I can do this.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.060
Come on, you gotta win.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.930
This feeling I have, like I
cannot move, I felt it for the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.730
first time during our duel with
Kite, I now understand that I am

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.890
afraid. This is
fear I am feeling

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.260
So if this is being afraid. How
do I make it stop?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.830
Astral! Hey - Astral!

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.190
Quit your daydreaming! In case
ya' hadn't noticed,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.530
we're dueling.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.560
I know. But you have
no monsters in your hand.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.660
And due to shock master's
special ability,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.630
you cannot use traps.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.790
If you do not pull a monster
card on This next draw

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.960
it is over.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.730
So then - All I
gotta do is draw a monster!

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.330
Here we go, I draw!

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.790
All right! But,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.690
argh! It's kurivolt and it's
Only got 300 attack points

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.490
we can use it! Listen, you must
summon that monster

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.960
but, he can't really do
anything,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.230
get it on the field.
You must trust me.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.160
All right,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.890
next, I summon, kurivolt!

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.660
Good work. Now your kurivolt can
use any overlay units in play

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.090
so that it can summon more
kurivolt tokens

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.360
to join it on your field.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.790
Right now, the only monster with
overlay units is shock master.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.590
I see what you're saying! With
Kurivolt's special ability

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.860
I can steal shock master's two
overlay units to summon two

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.690
kurivolt tokens on my field!

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.290
Gotcha!

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.930
Aw, yeah!

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.560
I got three on my field
now for the price of one!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.390
Ah, but why rely on Such
miserable creatures?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.030
Why not summon
something stronger?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.130
I see
you hold no other

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.090
monsters in your hand!

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.190
You had no choice but to rely on
Those pitiful creatures did you?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.690
Do not panic, yuma!
Use Voltage summon!

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.260
Okay,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.360
I'm activating the
voltage summon spell card!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.630
So why did I do that?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.990
Because it allows you to

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.990
exchange each one of your
kurivolt tokens with any monster

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.530
from your deck that's
level 4-Or-Below!

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.190
Oh, yeah!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.490
I tribute two kurivolt tokens.
And in their place, I

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.230
summon ganbara Knight and
kagetokage from my deck!

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.830
The downside is that voltage
summon leaves these two with no

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.960
attack points and
no defense points

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.060
but - that's no biggie
because it's overlay time!

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.730
With These two monsters, I

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.860
build the overlay
network and Xyz summon

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.730
number 39 - Utopia!

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.890
He was presented with an
overwhelming situation, and yet

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.390
he was able to shake his fear
and move forward, I must ask him

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.590
to teach me
how to do that.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.060
So that's the number
card I'll be taking.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.090
You wish!

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.060
Go, utopia, attack shock
master! Rising Sun slash!

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.790
Not only did I just mop the
floor with your number, I've

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.030
still got an attack left!

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.660
And since your field
is wide open, kurivolt

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.730
can attack you directly!

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.930
Just hang on, you guys! I'm
gonna get you outta there!

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.990
It's your move, side show!

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.030
Yuma, wait, place the
traps in your hand!

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.530
You cannot activate them yet,
but - Have them ready.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.530
Oh, yeah - Excellent point! I
place two cards facedown and end

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.430
my turn!

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.290
All is not lost,
we may have a chance

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.060
what? What are you
laughing at, freak show?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.930
I'm laughing at you.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.030
And the fact that you still
believe that you have a chance!

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.390
It's my turn, I draw!

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.960
First things first, from my
hand, I summon rainbow shaman!

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.790
I should thank you, boy. By
summoning an xyz monster and

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.330
using it to clear my field,
you enabled me to call

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.590
this monster forth!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.330
Yeah, well, you're welcome.
Zero attack points?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.660
I activate the xyz plant spell
card and with it, I can

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.290
choose a monster and then my
plant Transforms into a monster

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.230
with the same level!

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.030
So now I have two rainbow
shaman on my field!

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.060
You turned a spell
card into a monster?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.360
No!

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.260
And with that done, I now
overlay xyz plant

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.660
and rainbow shaman!

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.290
With These two monsters, I build
the overlay network,

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.260
I xyz summon
NUMBER 11: Big eye!

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.430
Another number!? you have got to
be kidding me!

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.830
And it is powerful.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.460
Did you really think
that I only had one

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.060
number card at my disposal? You
naive fool! I have collected

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.130
dozens of numbers
for my master Kite!

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.390
Can Yuma really
defeat This guy!?

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.190
I really don't think so.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.960
Try to stay focused. You still
have utopia.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.890
Right, so we're all good.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.760
Utopia can negate an attack by
Using an OVERLAY unit

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160
so no matter how powerful the
monster, the attack

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.230
won't get through.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.760
Except that I am about to

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.290
activate big eye's
special ability!

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.630
By Using one overlay Unit, big
eye can seize control of one of

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.230
your monsters!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.560
I am afraid your precious
utopia will now become

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.630
my little puppet!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.960
Ah, no!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.390
Big eye - Seize his monster!.
go temptation glance!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.960
Utopia!

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.530
This changes the situation.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.430
Without our number

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.190
utopia! - You will
do my bidding!

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.960
Attack kurivolt, now!

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.090
We're all gonna fall!

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.790
Save us, yuma!

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.860
Your fate will be delayed a bit
more. For big eye cannot attack

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.590
on the turn it uses a xyz
special ability. So for now.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.790
I place a facedown
and end my turn!

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.160
My turn! I draw!

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.760
Sweet!

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.930
Now I can summon a monster!

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.330
Dear boy, you haven't gone and
forgotten that I can see all

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.460
your cards, now, have

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.730
what!?
you just drew, a monster card!

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.190
So it's the perfect time for me
to activate my freezing

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.090
Dance trap CARD!

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.390
Beginning now, for the next two
turns, neither one of us can

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.560
summon a monster!

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.460
Without a monster, yuma's

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.830
just big eye bait waiting
to be obliterated!

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.390
Maybe

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.690
I guess I have to end my turn,

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.130
how unfortunate! Truly!

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.560
The end is here, boy. Tumble
into the depths of oblivion

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.390
along with your little friends!

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.090
Big eye attack him directly.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.430
Yuma, the trap card!

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.430
Oh, yeah, right! I can use
traps again starting This

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.060
turn! I'm still in this!

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.530
I activate

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.790
nitwit outwit! By sending a
monster card in my hand to my

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.590
graveyard, it reduces the damage
I take equal to my monster's

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.830
attack points!

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.990
Dododo warrior!
I need your help!

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.460
If you think you've managed to
somehow avoid defeat,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.690
think again!

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.930
Utopia attack!

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.490
Now would be a good time
to play the other trap!

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.830
Right! I activate the
xyz weight trap card!

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.160
Now an XYZ monster loses 800
attack points for every one of

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.360
it overlay units!

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.060
Oh no!

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.830
Gotcha

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.290
It's impressive that you were
able to survive two direct

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.160
attacks, but now I've got a

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.560
surprise for you,
the twilight dance spell card!

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.490
This spell prevents both
of us from summoning

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.090
monsters from our graveyards!

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.430
You're all out of
options now, boy.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.860
Come on

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.190
your field is empty,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:05.490
and, I have two powerful
monsters ready to do my bidding.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.630
You cannot resist anymore! You
don't need a fortune teller to

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.690
tell you that you
have no chance!

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.730
Your move

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.130
this is, the end.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.660
I'm sorry.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:38.460
There is a way for you to save
them, it's the only way.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.530
Surrender this duel. Accept
defeat. And relinquish your

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.760
number card to me and
to my master Kite.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.990
If you do So, then I will let
your little friends go

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.190
seriously?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.960
It's a good deal you're being
offered here. If you give

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.760
up on one little Lamb
you will be able to

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.430
save the entire flock.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.030
I can't look!

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.090
Yuma

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.960
don't do it
don't do it, yuma!

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.260
No

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.830
why would you even hesitate!?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.790
clearly, it is the best choice!

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.660
I told you that we
should not have come here

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.430
we have no chance of defeating
him, to keep Dueling would be to

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.930
doom your friends

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:44.690
there is only one thing
we can do now, yuma

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.490
we have lost, hand
over the number card.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.230
But, if I surrender the duel,
then you'll, vanish.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.390
You have to surrender your
number card, yuma, in order to

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.790
save your friends - You have to.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.460
There's gotta be
another way, astral!

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.030
There is not.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.730
My friends Have always been
there when I needed them

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.290
good times and bad times, ups
and downs - Through

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.690
thick and thin

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.090
I'm not just gonna
ditch my friends.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.430
I know. That is why
I am saying you

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.530
you still don't get it, do you!?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.260
I said - I won't abandon

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.030
any of my friends, astral, and

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.230
you're my friend!

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.730
If I surrender this duel, then
it's lights out for you.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.430
Can that be True?

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.460
Yuma

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.890
Well?

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:47.530
Stop muttering to yourself over
there and tell me your decision!

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.060
You really think I'm just gonna
call it quits and give you

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.690
my number card? Guess you can't
see the future after all!

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.830
Ah! In that case, master Kite is
looking forward to watching me

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.890
win and adding your
soul to his collection!

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.430
What's with that, Kite? You're
making peons do your dirty work

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.560
now? What's wrong? Too
chicken to duel me yourself?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.930
Uh, hey! How do I know that's
really Kite sitting up there?

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.060
It! What are you saying?
Of course it's Kite!

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.590
Oh, yeah? Let's see!

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.830
Cat's about to pounce!

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.390
A fake!?

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.530
so then, that was not Kite?

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.390
What have you? Do you realize
what you have done.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.760
Ha ha ha, I knew something
didn't seem right.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.560
I dueled Kite once. He seemed
like more of the lone Wolf type,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.590
not the type who relies on
minions and underlings

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.630
to get things done.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.190
You don't even know him, do you?
You phoney!

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.130
I was afraid of something that
was not even there?

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.030
Heh, I was kinda
freakin' out, too.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.190
But then sometimes you just
gotta step up and feel the flow!

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.760
Know what I mean, Buddy?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.890
Yes I do

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.230
I realize now fear is

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.090
not the only emotion I have
grown to understand, watching

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:31.990
yuma confront obstacles and rise
up to meet challenges, I

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.030
think I have also learned what

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.160
it means to "Hope."

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.090
Whoa!

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.060
What is that!?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.590
look, guys

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.590
is that, astral?

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.860
Whoa, is that astral?!

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.960
yuma, win this.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.730
You got it, pal! Get ready!

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.330
It's my turn - I draw!

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.730
The comeback spell card!

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.590
Use it, yuma! And
get utopia back!

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.790
on it! First up, I'm activating
the spell card comeback!

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.060
With this bad boy, I can regain
control of a

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.430
monster on your field!

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.830
Utopia - Come back!

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.190
No!

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.630
And now we can achieve victory!
The path has been made!

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.530
Path? - For what?!

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.090
for this, chaos number 39.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.290
Chaos number?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.990
By combining utopia with its
overlay units, utopia can

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.990
further evolve itself!

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.360
The time is now, yuma!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.630
Go Chaos xyz
evolution!

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.360
Get ready for chaos
number 39!

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.430
I give you -- Utopia ray!

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.390
Where did all this
awesomeness come from!?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.760
Yeah.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.230
I did not see this transpiring!
Nevertheless - My big eye

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.360
is more powerful!

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.790
Not when utopia ray's special
ability activates! By Using an

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.630
overlay unit, it gains 500
attack points!

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.260
Right now, utopia ray has three
overlay units, which are all

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.830
about to be used!

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.730
Go overlay charge!

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.260
No, no!

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.490
And - For every overlay unit,
your monster loses one thousand

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.390
attack points.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:27.960
That means!

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.560
It sure does!

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.830
Do it, utopia ray!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.960
Attack Big eye!

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.230
Rising Sun chaos slash!

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.490
Uh-! huh?

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.660
Hey, you guys!

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.160
He sure is amazing!

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.490
Yeah, he's incredible!

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.530
He saved us!

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.790
Stupendous!

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.460
That was maybe the
coolest thing ever!

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.190
Why are you guys all about
astral right now?!

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.590
what about me!?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.430
forget it, I'm going home!

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.430
Yuma!

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.260
Hang on!

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.630
Observation Number 13 - As long
as you have friends,

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.260
you have hope.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.560
Sub-Observation, 13.A,
yuma is my friend.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.430
Heh, heh, heh!
That mutton-Headed child thinks

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.360
he took all of my number cards

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.260
fortunately, I was wise enough
to keep my most

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.090
Precious number Card here

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.590
wha! It, it's you!

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.330
Kite! It's really you!

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.930
Master! - I've been watching
you. I think that

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.660
you're incredible!

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.360
I would give you anything
and everything!

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.790
Kite: Good to know. In that
case, I'll take that number, and

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.330
while we're at it,
I'll take your soul.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.230
I thank you for your loyalty.
