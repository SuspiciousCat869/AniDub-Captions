WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.707
Hey, what's up
with those two shiny lights?

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:07.407
I know.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.742
It is two
Galaxy-Eyes.

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.745
They are battling
on the lunar surface.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.081
It's got to be Kite!

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.650
By using the legends,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.753
and letting
their power guide me,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.320
(rumbling)

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.758
I'll bring into existence
a Dragon never seen before!

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:30.764
Now arise, Number 62:
Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon!

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.735
A new Galaxy-Eyes? 
Impossible!

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.107
I activate Tachyon Chaos Hole!

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.744
This trap banishes all the cards
on your field!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:44.678
My cards!

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:49.616
Your Prime Photon will now
return to the realm of legend!

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.554
Arise again, Chaos Number 107!

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.258
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:02.763
I summon Number 46!
Dragluon!

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:05.766
(roaring)

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.168
What?
Can it be?

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.737
Pardon me for interrupting
your duel.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:11.305
Jinlon!

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:15.542
Mizar, this is not
who you were meant to be.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.578
Don Thousand has
twisted your fate.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:22.249
He altered your memories in
order to further his plans.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.749
Ahh!

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.153
Can what he told me be true?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.523
It cannot be.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:29.888
Mizar!

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.294
Nonsense... I almost believed
that old fool's lie.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.762
Did you enjoy that?

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.199
A rare moment of doubt unlikely
to ever happen again!

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:44.738
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon,
attack Kite directly!

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.741
He's done for!

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.543
Aah!

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:50.243
Kite, no!

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:57.017
If you have any last words, now
would be a good time for them!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.551

Here it comes, Master!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:03.016
Baria-Shield,
engage!

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.353
It's holding!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.322
I hope that's enough
to protect them!

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.061
Kite!

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.095
My son!

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:16.363
Hang on!

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.767
<i>Are you all right, Master Kite?</i>

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.436
Yeah, just keep that shield up!

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.739
<i>Yes, sir, but if I wind up onthe</i>
scrap heap after this duel,

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:31.511
<i>please tell Lillybot thatl</i>
fought bravely with you!

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.446
No, I won't!

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.481
Because you're gonna
tell her yourself!

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.718
<i>That's unlikely, because</i>
the shield is failing!

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.453
<i>Brace yourself!</i>

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.122
(groaning)

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.623
Kite's down!

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.728
It seems my last maneuver
really "floored" you.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.096
It is your move...

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.099
That is, if you are
capable of moving.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.735
Of course the most intelligent
move you could make

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.237
would be
to concede defeat to me.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:57.671
Never!

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.141
<i>Was there any major damage</i>
to your components, Master?

00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:02.676
No, and what about you?

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.745
<i>My functionality is at 50%,</i>

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:08.415
<i>but I can reroute power</i>
to keep my systems going.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.750
I salute your tenacity, Kite,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.653
but with no monsters on your
field or cards in your hand,

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.689
your situation is hopeless.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.757
Don't be so sure!

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.092
I just hope I can
make good on that.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.763
Everything hinges
on this next card.

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:25.031
Aaah!

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:25.632
<i>Master Kite!</i>

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:29.603
<i>My servo-motors may be damaged,</i>
but I can still help you draw!

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:30.704
All right, fine.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:31.738
You ready, Orbital?

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.740
<i>Affirmative!</i>

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.743
We draw!

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.746
Yes!
Just what I need!

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:44.251
I'm placing a monster face down
in defense mode!

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:44.751
Good luck.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.487
You'll need it now.
(groaning)

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.455
Oh, please.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.357
Spare me the tough talk, Kite.

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.592
You have no monster
that can save you,

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:56.329
but to add more despair to your
already desperate situation,

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.566
I activate the spell
Galactic Charity!

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.969
By discarding one card
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.205
I am allowed to draw two cards!

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.741
Next, I activate the spell
Tachyon Refresh

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:12.612
to banish my Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.416
It loses Galaxy Refresh,

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.553
so its attack points get
a considerable boost!

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.488
This sets the stage
for me to re-summon

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.759
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
fiercer than before!

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.695
Now that it's no longer
equipped with Galaxy Rebirth,

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.264
its attack points
are back to 4,500!

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.733
Quite so, and if that
made you nervous,

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.269
this will send you
into a full-on panic!

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:41.541
I equip Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon
Dragon with Tachyon Cannon!

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.743
My Dragon loses 500
attack points,

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.746
but whenever I cut
its attack points in half,

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.248
it can attack again!

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.984
And I can use this effect
over and over

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:55.755
until Neo Tachyon Dragon has
less than 500 attack points!

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:59.092
That doesn't sound too good!

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.027
Time to give this paltry human

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.330
the misery he has come
to expect!

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.767
Neo Tachyon, attack Kite's
facedown monster!

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.270
(explosions)

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:15.609
Galaxy Mirror Sage's
special ability activates!

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:23.350
It'll restore my life points
by 800.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.655
Then I can place it on
my field again to protect me!

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.129
Unfortunately if my Galaxy
Mirror Sage is destroyed again,

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.565
it'll be banished
and I'll be defenseless.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.067
Then that is exactly
what I will do!

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.503
I activate Tachyon Cannon's
effect!

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.072
By cutting my Dragon's
attack points in half,

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.507
it can attack again!

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:52.078
Ultimate Tachyon Spiral
of Destruction!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.584
Galaxy Mirror Sage's
special ability activates!

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.054
My life points increase
one more time!

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:02.756
(explosion)

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.558
But your Mirror Sage
is banished,

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:08.762
leaving you open to attack!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.195
Argh!

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:13.600
I can see by your fear that you
know what I am going to do next.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.337
Neo Tachyon, take aim
for your third attack!

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:22.575
Fire at Kite, and be sure
to leave a mark!

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.710
(explosion)

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.145
Aaah!

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:27.180
<i>Defenses have been compromised!</i>

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.616
<i>Hang on, Master!</i>

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:31.985
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:35.755
Give Kite another fiery taste
of torment!

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.758
Blast him mercilessly!

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:41.561
(explosion)

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.630
No!
I can't watch this!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.398
I do enjoy toying with you.

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.766
It makes for very good sport.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.371
And sadly for you, I can never
get enough of a good thing!

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.674
Neo Tachyon!
Unleash your fury!

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.609
Attack!

00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:00.380
(explosion)

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.983
Kite, no!

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.257
(thudding)

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:16.496
Still here, Kite?

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:21.101
With only 100 life points left,
that will soon change.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:21.701
<i>Master Kite!</i>

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.237
<i>Life support systems</i>
are down to 5%.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:27.107
<i>Energy is at 3% and falling!</i>

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:30.543
Your little toy
confirms my suspicions.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.644
You are finished!

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.247
(electricity buzzing, zapping)

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.186
<i>Master, are you...</i>
all right?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.755
Kite!

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:43.256
Kite, no!

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.195
<i>Kite!</i>

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.063
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:53.533
<i>It's me, Yuma!</i>

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.502
Yu-
Yuma?

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:56.269
<i>Yeah, it's me!</i>

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.438
<i>Stay with us, Kite!</i>

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.306
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.207
What's with you?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.442
Hasn't anything changed

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.744
now that you know the truth
about what happened?

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.279
Don Thousand tricked you!

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.615
Why continue fighting for him?

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:09.749
Insipid human!

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.384
You could not be more wrong!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.621
This duel has nothing to do
with Don Thousand!

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:18.258
I am dueling for only
one person: me!

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:21.361
My win today will prove
beyond the shadow of a doubt

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.763
that it is I
who am the one and only,

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:26.599
the true
Galaxy-Eyes master!

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.169
My great beast deserves
nothing less!

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:29.736
Mizar!

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.204
Our friend Kite, he is...

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:32.305
<i>Just fine.</i>

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.206
I'm not about to quit!

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:36.643
In fact, there is
no stopping either of us!

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:37.410
<i>But, Kite!</i>

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.611
No buts about it, Yuma.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:43.283
This duel doesn't end until
one of us walks away the winner.

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:43.750
Please, Kite, think!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.186
You're in seriously bad shape
and you know it!

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:49.656
There's no telling
what could happen to you!

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.659
(moaning) Yuma...

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.760
You must understand.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:57.230
Some things need to be seen
through all the way

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.331
to the bitter end!

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:02.735
And if that means a little
danger, I say bring it on!

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:04.737
It's my turn!

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:05.271
I draw!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:09.175
Even someone as stubborn as you
must see you have already lost.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:13.746
Your Galaxy-Eyes is gone, along
with your chances of winning!

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:14.581
No, I think not.

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:19.419
What you fail to understand is
that there's always hope, Mizar.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.687
Hope?

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.455
Yes, I'll show you!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.090
By winning this duel!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:30.163
I bring back Number 62:
Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon!

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.438
(dragon roaring)

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:42.542
How could you bring
Prime Photon Dragon back?

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.009
Simple.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.179
It has a power unlike anything
you have ever faced!

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:49.749
When Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon
Dragon left the field,

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.184
it had two Overlay Units,

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:54.354
so its special ability lets it
return two turns later...

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:58.525
which unfortunately
for you... is now!

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:02.762
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
only has 250 attack points!

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:06.399
With one strike,
Kite can win this!

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.036
Your Prime Photon Dragon
is formidable indeed, Kite.

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:12.739
But my Neo Tachyon will
bring it to its knees

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:17.277
because it fights alongside
the true Galaxy-Eyes master!

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:20.146
And you will fall
right beside it!

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.515
I activate Tachyon Unit!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.150
By paying 500 life points,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.755
I can activate Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon's special ability

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:32.392
without using
a Chaos Overlay Unit!

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:32.759
Interesting.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:37.764
Come now, I am sure you can
muster more enthusiasm than that

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.766
for my shrewd strategy.

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.734
It is sure to shake things up!

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:43.436
All other cards
lose their effects

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:47.440
and return to how they were
at the beginning of the turn!

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.441
Now that Tachyon Cannon

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:52.212
no longer weakens my
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon,

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:55.682
it is restored
to its full strength.

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:58.751
And while my Neo Tachyon Dragon
gains power,

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:04.057
your Prime Photon loses
its place on the field!

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:07.260
(laughing)

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:15.635
Farewell, Prime Photon Dragon!

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:20.440
(dragon roaring)

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.176
Your Dragon is still
on the field... but how?!

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:24.677
Is this really too complicated

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:28.014
for you to wrap your
little Barian brain around?

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.550
See, your Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.152
may have rewound time
for special abilities

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:34.754
that activated <i>this</i> turn,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:40.593
but Prime Photon's special
ability activatedtwo turns ago!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.763
Oh, Kite, that hardly
matters at all!

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:47.767
My Neo Tachyon is now stronger
than your Prime Photon!

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:51.004
You would be crazy
to attack it!

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:57.010
Yeah, crazy like a fox!

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.744
Huh?

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.612
Prime Photon Dragon,

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:04.150
lock on your target
and then fire away!

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.055
Eternity Photon Stream!

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:10.056
You have just lost!

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:12.759
Go, Ultimate Tachyon
Spiral of Destruction!

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:16.763
Put an end to Prime Photon and
to this wretched human!

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.765
(explosion)

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:20.600
What is your problem, Mizar?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.403
Why do you despise
humans so much?

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.639
I have my reasons,
if you must know.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.740
I think something happened

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.043
to make you believe
humans are your enemies

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.744
and it created your distrust
of us all.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.748
So you placed your trust
in only dragons, am I right?

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.750
I can see it in your eyes!

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.751
They tell a story

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:43.690
about the connection
you share with dragons.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:47.160
(people shouting)

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.666
They took my mum and dad.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.472
It was humans who kidnapped my
parents and left me an orphan.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:10.316
I wandered alone for what seemed
an eternity.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.620
Ultimately I passed out,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.758
having been worn down
by hunger and exhaustion.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.763
Just as I feared
I couldn't go on,

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:27.166
a miracle granted me
a new beginning.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:48.521
A dragon came to my aid,
delivering me from fate's door.

00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:51.057
The dragon became
my new family.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:55.294
From that moment on, dragons
gained my lifelong trust.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:59.232
Humans, like you,
having brought me only woe,

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.001
gained my eternal scorn!

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.203
We are not so different, Mizar.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.740
I began dueling with dragons
for my family,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.042
to save them from harm.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:12.745
Back then, I had no idea
that using a Galaxy-Eyes

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.748
would change the path
of my life so dramatically.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:19.752
It led me to eventually face off
against Yuma and Astral.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:23.356
I got to know them, and Shark,
and others as well.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:26.325
I wound up getting involved
in their adventures.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:29.495
I guess that's the difference
between you and me.

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.330
You grew to distrust humans.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.466
I started out
not trusting them,

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.300
but, over time,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.104
becoming a Galaxy-Eyes user
taught me to see their value.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.539
Value? Humans?

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.107
Please!
Oh, yeah?

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.710
Prime Photon Dragon's
special ability activates!

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.615
Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon
Dragon's attack points
are multiplied!

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.116
How much?

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:54.086
By the number of Overlay Units
it had when it left
the field earlier,

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:56.022
so it now has 8,000
attack points!

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:59.759
No... Now his Prime Photon Dragon
has more attack points

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.761
than my Neo Tachyon Dragon!

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.764
And Prime Photon's going
to use them right now!

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:09.735
Prime Photon, attack
Mizar's Neo Tachyon!

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:21.080
Prime Photon, attack
Mizar's Neo Tachyon!

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.751
(explosion)

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.420
Huh?!

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.490
No!

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.458
(grunting)

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.127
(all gasping)

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:57.183
Oh!

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.656
(rumbling)

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.761
(explosions)

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.151
How can this be?

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.186
An entirely new dragon
has emerged!

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:37.623
It's the one the legend
spoke of!

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.358
<i>Master Kite!</i>

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.740
<i>Congratulations, Master Kite!</i>

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.609
<i>You were amazing!</i>

00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:57.677
Yeah, I know.

00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.478
You were better than nothing.

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.747
<i>That was almost a compliment!</i>

00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:03.549
<i>I'll take what I can get.</i>

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:07.053
<i>Permission to shut down, sir?</i>

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.756
<i>He fought with</i>
the courage of a hero

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.594
<i>and for that I will always be</i>
proud of him.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:18.431
We've both earned some rest.

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:24.637
Kite, no!

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:25.738
<i>This can't be!</i>

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:26.739
<i>Is he all right?</i>

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:28.240
<i>Oh man, I gotta get a move on</i>

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.976
<i>and head to the moon</i>
right away!

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:33.746
<i>Kite's in awful shape</i>
and needs my help!

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.081
Relax, Yuma.

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:38.084
I'll be okay, least I hope so.

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:40.119
Oh, no!
Hang on, Kite!

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.689
A medical transport
is on its way!

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:44.757
Relax.

00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:47.627
It's just a couple of nicks.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:51.063
Although...
I hope they hurry.

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.698
Oh, they will!

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.500
They'll land in moments.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.103
Hang on!
Please, Kite!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.555
Mizar.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.757
Told ya.

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:23.162
I knew I was the true
Galaxy-Eyes master.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:30.302
(rumbling, lightning crashing)

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.172
(laughing madly)

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.508
Nash, I'm waiting for you!

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.743
Accept your fate and face me!

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.645
Come and meet your destruction!

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:45.484
Vector and Don Thousand, your
mad reign of pain ends now!

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:48.654
Kite, you won.

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.256
Don Thousand will not!

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:54.760
I'll just have to trust
that Kite will be okay,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.761
because right now

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:59.198
we have something much bigger
to worry about!

00:19:59.198 --> 00:19:59.765
Agreed.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:04.737
Don Thousand!
We're coming for you!
