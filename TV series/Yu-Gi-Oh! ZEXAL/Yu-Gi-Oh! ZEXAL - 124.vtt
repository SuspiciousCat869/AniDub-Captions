WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.852
(Yuma)
Last time
on 'Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal'...

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:05.354
(Mr. Heartland)
Impossible!

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:08.891
You're supposed to be trapped
in another dimension!

00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:10.526
I'll duel in Kite's place!

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:14.397
After sealing this victory,
I'm sure to become

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.700
one of the seven
Emperors of Barian world!

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.903
To celebrate, I'm going
full Barian!

00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:22.905
(both) Let's duel!

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.907
(Vector) Nash and Marin?

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:27.643
I was sure I got rid of them
both a long time ago.

00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:31.681
(Nash)
Marin and I stand with you,
our fellow Emperors.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.483
We will fight for the Barians!

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.421
(both) Go Zexal Morph!

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:39.255
No way!

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:43.893
Go Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:46.395
(groans)

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:48.898
(groaning)

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.904
You'll pay for this.

00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:58.174
There's only one thing to do.

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.911
We gotta take down the Barians.

(thunder)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.208
(all gasp)

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.214
What do you think's
gonna happen, Astral?

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.391
(shouting)

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.129
(Orbital 7) Master Kite!

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.570
(coughing)

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.509
Ahh! It can't be!

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.616
Shark. What're you...

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:53.155
Shark, what are you doing
with the Barians?

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.296
I don't get it.
What's going on?

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:01.430
What's the deal?

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.899
Rio's up with them too.

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:08.470
(Yuma) Shark, what gives?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.438
(Shark) 'Shark'?

00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:11.574
It feels like a long time
since anybody

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:13.909
called me by that name.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.779
But I'm not Shark
or Reginald anymore.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.881
My name is Nash!

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:21.550
Nash the Barian!

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.685
Ahh!

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:24.520
Shark is a Barian?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.222
That can't be true!

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:30.192
Tori's right.

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:32.895
Stop playing games
with us already, Shark.

00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:35.698
There's no way you're a Barian.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.233
You wouldn't lie to me.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.902
So what's really going on here?

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:41.704
Tell me.

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.541
(groans) Say something!

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:47.843
I'll do much more
than just say something.

00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:50.179
I'll show you what I really am.

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.681
Go Barian Battle Morph!

00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.150
(all) Go Barian Battle Morph!

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.820
(groans nervously)

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.259
(Shark groans)

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.899
We are the seven
Barian emperors.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:14.236
Mizar, the one true
Galaxy-Eyes Master.

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.873
Girag, the ultimate
Barian Warrior.

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:22.878
Alito, the Barian who battles
with fists of fury.

00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:26.649
Vector... need I say more?

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.852
Marin, the name
that brings chills

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:31.587
to everyone's hearts.

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:36.892
Dumon, my faithful friend,
but your greatest enemy.

00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:38.827
And I am Nash,

00:04:38.827 --> 00:04:42.898
leader of the seven
Barian emperors.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:49.271
I can't believe Shark
is the leader of the Barians.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:59.246
I can't believe that Shark

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.815
is the head honcho
of the Barians.

00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:04.151
This is so messed up.

00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:05.085
(groans)

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:08.288
(Astral)
Yuma, at one
of the ruins we discovered,

00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:11.558
I witnessed a vision
of Shark's past.

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:13.594
Oh, yeah?
What did you see in it?

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:15.128
Shark's kingdom
was under attack,

00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:18.332
and he was leading his people
into a fierce battle.

00:05:18.332 --> 00:05:19.633
He was their emperor.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:21.802
He inspired his people,
filling them

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:24.805
with courage and hope.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:25.806
I don't get it.

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:26.807
If Shark was such a good guy,

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:29.243
then why is he working
with the Barians?

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:30.611
I do not know.

00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:34.081
What I do know is
that he is now our enemy.

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.049
I don't care what he is!

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:36.783
Shark's still my friend,

00:05:36.783 --> 00:05:38.685
and I'm not gonna fight him!

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:42.456
Astral is right,
we are what we are.

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:44.791
No way!
We are what we do!

00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:47.327
I've dueled lots
of different people,

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:48.562
but no matter who it was,

00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:51.031
dueling created
a connection, a bond,

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:54.768
and it always helped us
understand each other.

00:05:54.768 --> 00:05:56.803
Shark, if you're a Barian,

00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:59.573
you might think
the bond we had is broken.

00:05:59.573 --> 00:06:00.641
But I'm gonna duel you

00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:03.710
and prove that it's stronger
than ever!

00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:07.180
(gasping) What the what?

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.057
(sighing nervously)

00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:19.760
(Shark) Vector!

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.162
Vengeance will be mine!

00:06:22.162 --> 00:06:24.164
This, I promise.

00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:26.700
I will get payback
for my sister.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.537
(Yuma)
These are Shark's memories.

00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:32.639
I'm a Barian.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.610
Yuma, Astral, Kite.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.678
Who would've guessed it?

00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:39.780
Who would've guessed
that the leader

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.750
of their enemies was me?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.485
(shouts)

00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:50.791
(Enna)
Yuma, you are
our only hope.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.726
If our world
is to have a chance,

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:56.063
you must free Astral
before he is erased.

00:06:56.063 --> 00:06:58.799
Please don't leave me
again, Astral!

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:00.500
Don't ever leave me!

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.402
(Nash)
These are Yuma's memories.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.204
He's been carrying
the weight of his world

00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:07.808
on his shoulders, just like
I've been carrying mine.

00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:09.609
(groans)

00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:11.411
(groans)

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:13.814
(Tori)
Yuma! Yuma!

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:16.083
(Marin) Nash?

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.418
(groans in pain)

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:21.188
I saw... your past.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:22.322
(sighs in pain)

00:07:22.322 --> 00:07:23.790
(Tori) Yuma!

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.459
We must prepare to battle.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:29.229
(Roku)
But what if this
is a war you cannot win?

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.765
Retreat is not defeat.

00:07:36.203 --> 00:07:39.106
All right...
let's move out!

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.641
Bronk, Tori, take Yuma.

00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:44.077
Orbital, take care of Kite.

00:07:44.077 --> 00:07:44.811
Yes... yes, sir!

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:47.681
(Girag)
Hey, what's
goin' on here?

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:48.682
(Vector)
Look! They're...

00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:52.085
(Nash)
Gone... after them!

00:07:52.085 --> 00:07:57.491
♪ ♪ (action music)

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:00.794
(Orbital 7) Master Kite...

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:02.396
They're not behind us.

00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:04.131
I guess we lost them, guys.

00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.800
I'm sure they're on the prowl.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.639
I found them!

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.809
Ahh!

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:19.479
(groans)

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:20.414
Who are you?

00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:23.617
Anna Kaboom, so get ready
to get blasted

00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:27.587
'cause I'm not going to let you
lay a finger on my Yuma.

00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:30.791
Nobody gets
in my way, little girl.

00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:33.760
The only thing little
about this girl is her fuse.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.297
You got that?
(The Sparrow)
Fear not, dear maiden!

00:08:37.297 --> 00:08:39.066
(gasps)

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.701
The Sparrow is here
to save the day.

00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:43.804
Surrender now,
you vile villain,

00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:45.572
or face the consequences!

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:48.341
It's the Sparrow.
And Anna!

00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:49.810
But how...
It seems Yuma's friends

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.941
have found out
the world's in danger,

00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.707
and they've come to help
save it.

00:08:54.707 --> 00:08:55.748
Stop the car.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.013
Let me out.

00:08:58.013 --> 00:09:01.049
There's something I gotta do.

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:04.886
This has gone on
far enough, Girag.

00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:06.655
Yes, it all stops now.

00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:08.924
You sure about that,
or are you two cowards

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:11.259
planning on pulling
a disappearing act again?

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.894
The time has passed
for running,

00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:15.130
unless you are
too afraid to stand up

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.165
to an old man and his student.

00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:19.267
Bring it on, Grandpa.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.937
I'll crush the both of you!

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.807
(Alito) Where did they go?

00:09:25.807 --> 00:09:26.274
(groans)

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.776
(Nistro) Nice catch.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.512
I don't have time
for silly games.

00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:31.146
What's the matter?

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:35.083
You afraid
you'll strike out against me?

00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:38.853
(Dumon)
You are foolish
to come to Yuma's aid.

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:43.592
Your interference will have
grave consequences.

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:46.595
For you, that is.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:47.829
Bronk, you know full well

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:50.599
that you don't have the skills
to stand up to me.

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:51.800
Step out of the way.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.234
Quit fooling around, Rio.

00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:55.270
That mask ain't your style.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:00.275
Sorry to disappoint you,
Bronk, but I'm Marin.

00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:01.810
There is no Rio.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.546
You'll always be Rio to me!

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:08.483
Huh?

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.259
(Quinton) Shark.

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:20.862
We cannot outrun him.

00:10:20.862 --> 00:10:23.865
Good, 'cause running
isn't my style.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.169
Wait.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.805
I'm not going
to let you do this, Quattro.

00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.974
I can't let you take on
your best friend.

00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:34.976
There's too much
at stake between you two.

00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:39.247
That's exactly why I have
to be the one to battle him.

00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:42.117
Yuma can't duel now,
so I'm the only one here

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:44.986
who has a chance
to get through to him.

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:47.756
Like always,
it's no use arguing with you.

00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:51.059
At least take this card
and use it.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:53.261
This is the card
you were working on

00:10:53.495 --> 00:10:55.930
to stop the Barians.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.965
But be careful.

00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:58.199
I don't do careful.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.168
You know that, Quinton.

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:12.180
(tires screeching)

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.251
(Nash)
So, Quattro, I guess
you drew the short straw.

00:11:16.251 --> 00:11:18.253
Stop this nonsense, Shark.

00:11:18.253 --> 00:11:20.722
Come on, you're not
fooling anybody.

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.057
You're no Barian.

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.658
You know you're one of us.

00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:25.894
Things have changed, Quattro.

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.629
We live in different
worlds now.

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.665
Talking about the past
changes nothing.

00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:33.268
I am Nash.
Shark is no more.

00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:35.270
I know you're
still in there somewhere,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.038
and I'm going to do
everything I can

00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:42.010
to bring you back, no matter
what the consequences will be.

00:11:46.014 --> 00:11:47.816
(Astral) Yuma, can you feel it?

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:50.618
The bonds that you have forged
through your dueling

00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:52.887
are now trying to protect you.

00:11:52.887 --> 00:11:55.056
The seven emperors
are powerful enemies,

00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:58.993
but you must believe in
the strength of your friends.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:02.897
Duel Disk!

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.134
Set!

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.253
(all) Duel!

00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:42.270
(Vector)
Well, well...
the fun begins, Nash.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.738
(cackles)

00:12:43.738 --> 00:12:45.640
You've been away a long time.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.575
Let's see
if you still can unleash

00:12:47.575 --> 00:12:50.245
your full Barian powers.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.780
My turn!

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.680
I draw!

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.619
First, I summon
Gimmick Puppet Humpty Dumpty.

00:13:01.256 --> 00:13:02.924
Thanks to it, I can summon

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:05.260
another Gimmick Puppet
from my hand.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:10.231
Come on out,
Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer!

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:19.507
Next, I'm activating
the spell card Level Doubler.

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:24.245
By sending one card in my hand
to the graveyard,

00:13:24.245 --> 00:13:26.648
I can double
my monster's Level.

00:13:26.648 --> 00:13:29.717
So get your yolk on,
Humpty Dumpty!

00:13:29.717 --> 00:13:34.255
Now, I activate Gimmick Puppet
Gear Changer's special ability.

00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:38.960
Gear Changer becomes the same
Level as Humpty Dumpty.

00:13:41.262 --> 00:13:47.268
I overlay Level Eight
Humpty Dumpty and Gear Changer.

00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:54.709
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.981
I Xyz Summon Number 15...

00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:03.251
Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder!

00:14:09.023 --> 00:14:09.991
This will be fun.

00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:15.063
Next, I equip Gimmick Shield
onto Giant Grinder.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.764
Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder

00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:20.068
swaps its attack
and defense points.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.271
But that's not all.

00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:24.772
You take 300 points of damage

00:14:24.772 --> 00:14:28.276
for every Overlay Unit
that Giant Grinder has.

00:14:28.276 --> 00:14:30.645
Giant Grinder has
two Overlay Units.

00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:34.249
You take 600 points of damage!

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:37.852
I bet that doesn't tickle,
does it?

00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:40.255
With that, I end my turn.

00:14:43.157 --> 00:14:44.926
My turn!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.961
I draw!

00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:50.765
I summon Saber Shark!

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.267
(Saber Shark
groans indistinctly)

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.670
And now that I have
a Water monster on my field,

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.807
I also get to summon
Silent Angler.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:05.246
And now, Quattro,
brace yourself for my ace.

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:05.947
Hm.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:11.552
I overlay Level 4 Saber Shark
and Silent Angler.

00:15:14.255 --> 00:15:16.257
With these two monsters,

00:15:16.257 --> 00:15:18.693
I build the Overlay Network.

00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:22.230
I Xyz Summon Number 101...

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.866
Silent Honor Ark.

00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:39.247
Well, that's new.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.983
Shark never had
that Number before.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:42.917
Now, I activate

00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:47.188
Silent Honor Ark's
special ability.

00:15:47.188 --> 00:15:48.990
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.826
your Giant Grinder
is transformed

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.895
into an Overlay Unit.

00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:10.511
My Giant Grinder is gone.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:15.650
Silent Honor Ark,
attack Quattro directly!

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.552
Phantom Flood.

00:16:21.255 --> 00:16:23.091
(shouting)

00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:32.967
(Nash)
Silent Honor Ark,
attack Quattro directly!

00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:35.203
Phantom Flood!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.038
(shouting)

00:16:39.273 --> 00:16:41.709
You never should
have challenged me.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.044
It only gets worse.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.946
(groans and coughs)

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:48.750
Stay down if you know
what is good for you.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.786
Appear Number 103!

00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:53.888
Ragnazero!

00:17:01.262 --> 00:17:02.530
Don't you get it?

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.134
I'm a Barian now,
mind and body.

00:17:06.134 --> 00:17:08.269
Now's not forever.

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:09.270
I get it.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.939
You're determined
to destroy us,

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:12.974
but I'm determined too...

00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:16.244
determined to get
my friend back!

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:19.113
My turn!
I draw!

00:17:19.113 --> 00:17:19.680
It's showtime.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.019
I activate the spell card
Overlay Dark Reincarnation.

00:17:25.019 --> 00:17:26.220
I get to randomly remove

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.790
one of Silent Honor Ark's
Overlay Units.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.260
And if that Overlay Unit
happens to be my Giant Grinder,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.529
I get to summon it to my field.

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:36.564
Plus, I draw a card.

00:17:37.832 --> 00:17:41.235
But if it's not,
I lose half my life points.

00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:43.071
It's a 50/50 shot.

00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:45.573
I choose the one on the left!

00:17:50.178 --> 00:17:51.712
Bingo!

00:17:51.712 --> 00:17:55.249
Looks like I got
my Giant Grinder back!

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.152
But the fun's not over

00:17:58.152 --> 00:18:00.822
'cause I get
to draw a card now.

00:18:00.822 --> 00:18:02.523
So here goes!

00:18:02.523 --> 00:18:05.259
Yes! Exactly
what I was hoping for.

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:08.529
It's time to fight fire
with fire right now.

00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:13.234
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force!

00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:16.904
A new Rank-Up-Magic card?

00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:20.274
This card ranks up
my Xyz Monster

00:18:20.274 --> 00:18:22.643
into a Chaos Xyz Monster.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:27.248
I overlay
Rank Eight Giant Grinder!

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:32.253
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network.

00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:35.189
Go, Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:18:35.189 --> 00:18:37.592
(thunder)

00:18:37.592 --> 00:18:38.726
(screeching)

00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:39.260
(groans)

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.163
I summon Chaos Number 15...

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:45.833
Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter!

00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:56.911
I activate its special ability!

00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:59.247
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:18:59.247 --> 00:19:00.548
it crushes your monster,

00:19:00.548 --> 00:19:05.086
and you take damage equal
to that monster's attack points.

00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:07.255
Seek and destroy!

00:19:13.227 --> 00:19:14.862
Bull's-eye!

00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:19.033
No!

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:22.170
Your Ark should've
been annihilated.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.271
You thought wrong.

00:19:23.504 --> 00:19:25.773
By using its own
special ability,

00:19:25.773 --> 00:19:27.708
it can avoid being destroyed.

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.243
Looks like your special ability

00:19:29.477 --> 00:19:32.113
wasn't so special after all.

00:19:32.113 --> 00:19:36.918
Say what you want, but
your Ark has no Overlay Units.

00:19:36.918 --> 00:19:38.619
So there's no chance
you'll be able

00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:39.587
to stop me this time.

00:19:39.587 --> 00:19:43.191
Giant Hunter,
attack Silent Honor Ark!

00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:44.892
Battle Burst!

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.001
(groans)

00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:57.762
So did that attack knock
some sense back into you?

00:19:57.762 --> 00:20:00.231
You done pretending
to be a Barian?

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.799
(laughs) This little display

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:05.369
is not enough to change me,
you fool.

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:05.770
Huh.

00:20:06.003 --> 00:20:08.639
You think you have
the upper hand.

00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:10.160
Well, enjoy it while it lasts

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.262
because you will be
begging for mercy

00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:16.800
once I unleash the true power
of chaos on you.

00:20:18.094 --> 00:20:20.475
(Alito)
It is obvious
that you were no match

00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:23.211
for me
and my master's teamwork.

00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:24.512
(groans)

00:20:24.512 --> 00:20:26.546
(groans) This is impossible.

00:20:26.546 --> 00:20:29.583
I'm afraid losing
is quite possible.

00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:32.786
(Alito)
How could I have let him
gain the upper hand?

00:20:32.786 --> 00:20:33.253
It's simple.

00:20:33.253 --> 00:20:37.157
I'm smarter, I'm stronger,
and I'm a winner.

00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.660
You are going down, Quattro.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.396
Allow me to shed some light
as to why.

00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:44.865
(groans)

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:47.467
(Marin) Nash!

00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:48.735
(both gasping)

00:20:48.735 --> 00:20:49.603
(both groaning)

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:53.373
(Vector)
What's this?
What's Nash doing?

00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:57.471
Emperors...

00:20:59.574 --> 00:21:01.876
bring the chaos!

00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:04.545
(all) Chaos Draw!

00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:30.271
(groaning)

00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:10.571
