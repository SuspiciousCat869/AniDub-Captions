Yeah, right.

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:27.299
I'll prove it by activating
the trap Chaos Hundred Universe.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:30.403
All the Barian Numbers
you destroyed this turn

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:32.638
return to my field.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.251
And an equal number
of Barian Numbers

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:47.920
are summoned onto your field.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.189
-Ah!
-Onto our field?

Here comes Vector's

Why would Shark summon
monsters onto our field?

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:24.824
There's still one Barian
monster missing from this party.

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:28.861
I activate the spell
Hundred Summon.

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:31.997
Since I have three Barian
Numbers on my field,

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:36.135
this spell card lets me
summon the final Barian Number.

Astral, what's he gonna do
with all seven Barian Numbers?

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:56.956
I know not, but I do
fear for the worst.

00:20:56.956 --> 00:21:00.192
Now that the Seven
Barians are back together,

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.528
you have no chance!
