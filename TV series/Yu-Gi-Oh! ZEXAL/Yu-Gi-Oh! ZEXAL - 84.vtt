WEBVTT

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.154
(Astral)
Something strange and incredible
is happening in the human world.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:11.991
I sensed it when the 107th
Number appeared.

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:16.196
And when I saw the two
Galaxy-Eyes facing each other,

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.431
I was sure of it.

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:21.134
As the battle unfolded, my
suspicion grew even stronger

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:24.404
when our opponent Mizar revealed
his true Barian form.

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:28.775
I am afraid this can
only mean one thing...

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.744
the Barians are
about to make a critical move!

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:35.815
I can sense that Yuma is just as
anxious and confused as I am.

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:41.020
The Sphere Field used against
us is extremely powerful.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.857
I believe it affects
not just the body,

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:47.093
but the mind and
spirit as well.

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:49.729
The damage it inflicted
was so intense,

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.065
I needed to retreat inside
the Golden Key to recover.

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:55.969
Yuma is worried about me;

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.437
I can sense that his confidence
has been shaken.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.440
This is a dangerous moment.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.809
Our foes are growing stronger.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.844
Yuma wants to protect me,
but if he is too cautious,

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:08.014
he will not have the ability
to defeat the Barians.

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:16.322
(Yuma) Astral!

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:17.423
You depend on me
and I let you down.

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:20.293
I'm sorry.

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:22.061
From now on, I promise
I'll be more careful.

I knew you were irresponsible,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.204
but even I never thought you
could be so reckless

00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:40.907
that you landed
yourself in the hospital.

00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:43.109
And not just you,
but your friend too.

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.446
What's his name again,
uh, Reginald?

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:49.148
You could've been badly hurt!

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.351
The doctor says neither of you
has any serious injuries,

00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.153
so you can
count yourselves lucky.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.422
Still, that doesn't excuse
your foolish behavior.

00:02:56.422 --> 00:02:59.359
Excuse me, my brother
is trying to rest,

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.795
so I'd appreciate it if you
could keep it down in here.

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:06.165
Of course, sorry.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.201
Yuma, I have to go to work, so
stay in bed and out of trouble.

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.437
Got that?
All right.

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:15.274
Yuma, your sister
could strike fear

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:17.076
into the heart of
a grizzly bear.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:19.045
You two certainly are
different from each other.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:21.948
Yeah, she's a lot more
serious than you are.

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:24.917
Taller too!

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:26.953
Hey guys, keep it down
or we're gonna wake up Shark!

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.325
I forgot!

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.826
That's okay.

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.228
Shark's awake.

00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:36.429
(all) Huh?

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.197
I said that he was resting,
not sleeping.

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:41.100
I did it because
I thought it might help

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.435
calm Yuma's sister down,
and it sure seemed to work.

00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:45.938
Rio, close that curtain.

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:48.040
Huh? But why?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.876
Because with
the curtain closed,

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.878
it's easier to forget that
I'm rooming with a wimp.

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:59.152
Ugh.

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:04.424
What is wrong with him?

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:18.237
You look weak.

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:19.972
Have I worn you down?

00:04:19.972 --> 00:04:21.808
If you need a break, I'd be
happy to give it to you!

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:25.411
Attack with Tachyon
Spiral of Destruction!

00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:36.722
It was a dream.

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:38.424
It's okay.

00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:39.826
Calm down.

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:41.894
You're letting your fear
take complete control of you,

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.197
even in your sleep!

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:45.865
I can't take anymore!
Snap out of it already!

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:49.168
I mean it, Yuma.

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:50.736
Quiet down!

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:52.672
Do you loudmouths have any idea
what time it is?!

00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:59.445
Don't you understand, Kite?

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:01.414
Your friend's in the hospital.

00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:02.982
You should go visit him.

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:04.183
All right.

00:05:06.652 --> 00:05:07.887
You may not think this is
important, but I do.

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:10.723
Wait, Hart.

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:12.925
Where are you going?

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.393
I'm going to see Yuma,
of course.

00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:16.829
Master K-K-Kite!

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:18.130
I ch-checked the hospital's
visiting hours.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.032
You should
leave s-s-soon.

00:05:20.032 --> 00:05:21.834
But I hope you're not expecting
me to pop-pop-pop in on that

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:24.303
pitiful little pest!

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:26.439
I knew you'd go, Kite!

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:31.811
I'm glad Yuma's out
getting a checkup.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.046
At least he won't be able
to annoy me for a while.

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.262
Hey, what's this about?

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:51.130
(Shark)
"Yuma, I've taken
your little necklace.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.066
If you want it back, then you'll
have to duel me for it.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.869
I'll be waiting
for you on the roof."

00:06:06.212 --> 00:06:09.448
You showed up...
Good.

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.317
What's the point
of doing this, Shark?

00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:13.419
Why did you take my Golden Key?

00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:15.421
That's not important, Yuma.

00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:17.423
All that matters now
is that I have it,

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:19.825
and you're never going to
get it back unless you beat me.

00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:24.063
Let's go!

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:29.869
You better be at
the top of your game, Yuma.

00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:35.441
'Cause I can promise you
that in this duel,

00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:37.910
I won't hold back!

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.883
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:46.385
(both) Let's duel!

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:53.926
Yuma...

00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:58.798
It's my move!

00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:01.233
I'm putting a monster card
facedown in defense mode.

00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.337
(Yuma)
I don't wanna
take any chances.

00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.940
It's a good thing I have
Gogogo Golem on the field

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.109
to protect me.

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:11.444
You can take it
from here, Shark.

00:07:11.444 --> 00:07:13.713
That's it?
Only one lousy move?

00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:15.948
You're not trying to win;
you're just scared of losing!

00:07:15.948 --> 00:07:19.385
There's nothing wrong with
playing it safe, Shark.

00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:23.122
I can't believe
how pathetic you've become.

00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:26.292
Here!

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:35.935
Without Astral to help you,
you're no threat at all,

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:39.038
so team up with him
if you have to.

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:41.440
It's my move.

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.075
What's wrong?

00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:47.013
Astral isn't coming
to save you?

00:07:47.013 --> 00:07:49.448
Looks like he's finally
realized what a loser you are!

00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:56.722
First, I'll activate my
spell card Fish Spawn!

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:03.295
If I give up
a thousand life points,

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.231
this spell lets me summon
two Fish Spawn Tokens.

00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:08.401
But I'm going to tribute
both of them immediately

00:08:10.436 --> 00:08:12.972
because then I can summon a
Level Nine monster... Big Whale!

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:18.010
When it surfaces, any face-down
monsters in defense mode

00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:22.081
are blown face-up.

00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:23.949
Unlike your meek strategy,

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:25.718
I'm going big and bold, Yuma!

00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.421
There's more, 'cause Big Whale's
special ability will let me

00:08:29.955 --> 00:08:32.992
summon one Water Attribute
monster from my hand

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:36.295
if it's Level Four or less!

00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:38.264
Burst onto the scene,
Drill Barnacle!

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:44.437
Next I'll activate
my Tri-Slice spell!

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:47.306
By sending Big Whale
to the graveyard,

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:51.444
I can summon a trio
of Water Attribute monsters

00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:54.780
just as long as their Levels
are a third of Big Whale's!

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.384
I hope you like Starfish
'cause here come three of 'em!

00:09:01.987 --> 00:09:05.257
What are you up to?

00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:06.959
You're about
to find out, loser!

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.228
I overlay two Level
Three Starfish

00:09:09.228 --> 00:09:12.898
and I'll use them both
to build the Overlay Network!

00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:15.868
See where this is going?

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:17.703
I Xyz Summon!

00:09:19.338 --> 00:09:21.140
Submersible Carrier Aero Shark!

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.343
And next up, I'm overlaying
Drill Barnacle

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:27.346
and my last Starfish!

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:29.381
Not another Xyz Summon?

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.784
That's right, Yuma.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:34.053
I'm Xyz Summoning the champion
of darkness and devastation,

00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:38.224
Black Ray Lancer!

00:09:38.224 --> 00:09:40.826
Great... One Xyz monster's
bad enough,

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:43.129
but now I have to
go up against two of 'em!

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:46.365
You got that right!

00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:48.167
I activate Aero Shark's
special ability.

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:51.437
So all I have to do is use an
Overlay Unit and you'll take

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.940
400 points of damage
for each card in my hand.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.277
I happen to have two.

00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.346
Go Torpedo Takedown!

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:10.790
Now I activate Black Ray
Lancer's ability!

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.293
By using one Overlay Unit,
your Golem's special abilities

00:10:14.293 --> 00:10:17.429
are negated this turn!

00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:19.765
Paralyzing Lance!

00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:24.904
This is what
"playing it safe" gets you.

00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:27.706
Quick, Aero Shark!

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:30.876
Destroy that Golem
with Devouring Dive!

00:10:34.446 --> 00:10:38.417
Nothing can protect you
if I attack now, Yuma!

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:41.921
Black Ray Lancer,
attack Yuma directly!

00:10:42.388 --> 00:10:45.858
Shimmering Spear Slash!

00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:53.232
You've taken enough punishment
for one turn.

00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:56.001
It's your move.

00:10:56.435 --> 00:10:57.803
Come on, get up on your feet.

00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:02.041
Or is this duel
too much for you!?

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:04.944
No, it's not!

00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:09.381
(Yuma)
I have to take on
two Xyz monsters.

00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:11.717
But since my only monster
was destroyed,

00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:13.853
I'm starting from scratch.

00:11:13.853 --> 00:11:16.856
I'll go big this time!

00:11:16.856 --> 00:11:18.891
I'm summoning Gogogo Giant
in attack mode!

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.434
All right, you're
starting to put up a fight.

00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:32.438
(Yuma)
Gogogo Giant has
2000 attack points.

00:11:32.438 --> 00:11:35.741
It's powerful enough to take
down Aero Shark,

00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:38.377
but it's definitely not strong
enough to beat

00:11:38.377 --> 00:11:40.246
Black Ray Lancer.

00:11:40.246 --> 00:11:42.448
In that case...

00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:44.383
I'd better use
its special ability!

00:11:44.383 --> 00:11:48.087
Since I summoned Gogogo Giant,
I can also summon Gogogo Golem

00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:51.790
from my graveyard
in defense mode.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.226
Once that ability's used,

00:11:54.226 --> 00:11:55.761
I have to switch Gogogo Giant
into defense mode, too.

00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:59.365
I'll follow that up by
activating my spell card

00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:01.934
Gogogo Talisman!

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:04.069
It'll keep my Gogogo monsters
out of danger.

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:06.972
It protects them from being
destroyed once per battle.

00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:09.875
And for extra safety,
whenever I have two or more

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:12.344
Gogogo monsters, effects
can't damage me either!

00:12:12.344 --> 00:12:15.447
I can't deal any damage
this turn...

00:12:15.447 --> 00:12:18.183
but at least
I'll be well-shielded from

00:12:18.183 --> 00:12:19.985
your Aero Shark's torpedoes!

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:22.321
With that, I'll end my turn.

00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:24.390
Those moves won't save you!

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.091
Nothing will, because you're
a miserable coward!

00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:29.428
You'll never win another duel,

00:12:29.428 --> 00:12:31.163
'cause you're letting
your fears rule you!

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.134
Those moves won't save you!

00:12:35.134 --> 00:12:37.002
Nothing will because you're
a miserable coward!

00:12:37.002 --> 00:12:40.172
You'll never win another duel,

00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:41.874
'cause you're
letting your fears rule you!

00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:47.446
(Astral)
Yuma, you must understand.

00:12:47.446 --> 00:12:50.082
The enemies we are about to face
are more powerful than any

00:12:50.082 --> 00:12:52.952
we have known before.

00:12:52.952 --> 00:12:54.420
You must be ready for the
challenge, but the strength you

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.922
need for what lies ahead can
only be found within you.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:03.963
Time to crush you!

00:13:03.963 --> 00:13:05.998
I draw!

00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:07.399
I'll start this turn by
summoning Panther Shark!

00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:11.437
When you have at least two
monsters on the field,

00:13:11.437 --> 00:13:13.939
I can summon this card
without having to tribute

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:16.008
another monster!

00:13:16.008 --> 00:13:18.143
Yeah, let it roar,
Panther Shark!

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:22.881
In fact, this whole field is
about to be shark-infested,

00:13:22.881 --> 00:13:26.418
because once I
summon Panther Shark,

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:28.420
I can also summon Eagle
Shark from my hand.

00:13:29.888 --> 00:13:33.892
I overlay my Level Five
Panther Shark and Eagle Shark

00:13:33.892 --> 00:13:37.296
in order to build the Overlay
Network and Xyz Summon.

00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:46.739
Now I can bring forth
the most fearsome stronghold

00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:49.441
in the seas...
Shark Fortress!

00:13:58.417 --> 00:14:02.421
That gives him three Xyz
monsters on his field!

00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:05.424
And it's gonna get worse, Yuma!

00:14:05.424 --> 00:14:07.426
Because I'm bulking up
Black Ray Lancer

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:10.195
with the equip spell Sharkify!

00:14:12.765 --> 00:14:16.402
When it's equipped
with this card,

00:14:16.402 --> 00:14:18.070
my Lancer
becomes a Shark monster.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.439
Plus it gets stronger by
400 attack points!

00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:23.776
Next, I'm going to use an
Overlay Unit to activate

00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:26.178
Black Shark Lancer's
special ability!

00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:29.448
Which means it can now negate
your GOLEM's abilities!

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.353
Coward, you deserve everything
that's about to happen to you!

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:40.225
Now Aero Shark,

00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.827
dive at Gogogo Giant
and eliminate it!

00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:45.898
I activate my Gogogo
Talisman's effect.

00:14:45.898 --> 00:14:49.268
Once per turn, this spell can
stop a monster from being

00:14:49.268 --> 00:14:51.870
destroyed in battle!

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.439
So what!?
I'll just attack again!

00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:56.408
Black Shark Lancer,
bring down that Giant!

00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:05.050
But I'm not finished yet!

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.086
Shark Fortress, blast
Gogogo Golem into dust!

00:15:09.421 --> 00:15:11.223
My Talisman will negate
that Shark!

00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:23.368
I survived all three attacks.

00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:25.437
I'm not done!

00:15:25.437 --> 00:15:27.439
Didn't I say
I wouldn't hold back!?

00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:29.842
I set all this up as
part of my strategy.

00:15:29.842 --> 00:15:32.444
By using an Overlay Unit,
Shark Fortress' special ability

00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:35.447
gives one of my other Shark
monsters an extra attack.

00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:38.817
So I'm coming after you
with Aero Shark!

00:15:38.817 --> 00:15:41.420
Shark Fortress, arm Aero Shark

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.422
with one of your mighty
Mayhem Missiles!

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:46.325
Your target
will be Gogogo Golem!

00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:59.037
Launch missile!

00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:07.713
And since you don't have any
Gogogo monsters on your field,

00:16:07.713 --> 00:16:10.749
you can say goodbye
to your Talisman!

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:13.152
You're defenseless now!

00:16:13.152 --> 00:16:14.786
Once again, I activate my
Fortress' special ability.

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:18.390
I'll use an Overlay Unit to
give one of my Shark monsters

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.426
an additional attack.

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:23.428
You're up this time,
Black Shark Lancer.

00:16:23.662 --> 00:16:26.365
Arm yourself!

00:16:30.802 --> 00:16:34.773
Black Shark Lancer, prepare
to attack Yuma directly!

00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:38.243
Fire on my command!

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:44.883
Black Shark Lancer, prepare
to attack Yuma directly!

00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:48.420
Fire on my command!

00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:52.324
(Yuma)
This is like having the same
bad dream over and over.

00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:57.095
I'm gonna lose the duel
and there's nothing I can do.

00:16:57.095 --> 00:17:00.732
It's just like my battle
with Mizar.

00:17:00.732 --> 00:17:02.901
I couldn't protect Astral then

00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:04.770
and now I can't even
protect myself!

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.973
No matter how hard I try,
I can't keep from losing.

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:11.977
Maybe Shark is right; I have
been playing it too safe.

00:17:13.946 --> 00:17:17.683
All this time I've been so
scared of losing,

00:17:17.683 --> 00:17:19.952
that I've stopped
really trying to win.

00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:25.924
I have to stop hiding
behind my cards.

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:28.327
I wanna try to
high-five the sky again,

00:17:28.327 --> 00:17:30.429
together with Astral!

00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:32.097
(Astral)
That is exactly
what I have been

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:35.867
waiting to hear you say, Yuma.

00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:38.403
I thought I'd
never see you again.

00:17:38.403 --> 00:17:41.240
We are a team, Yuma, but
we cannot be effective

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.442
unless we duel without fear.

00:17:43.442 --> 00:17:45.444
If we battle boldly, we truly
can high-five the sky!

00:17:45.677 --> 00:17:49.147
Now summon Gagaga Gardna!

00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:52.417
Yeah, he's right.

00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:53.986
I summon Gagaga Gardna
from my hand!

00:17:55.354 --> 00:17:58.423
It's lucky you're
attacking me directly, Shark,

00:17:58.423 --> 00:18:01.093
'cause that lets me summon
Gardna in attack mode!

00:18:01.093 --> 00:18:04.429
And by discarding
one card from my hand,

00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:06.431
this monster can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:14.239
Your Gardna won't be destroyed,

00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:15.974
but you'll still take
major damage, Yuma!

00:18:19.978 --> 00:18:23.448
And with that, I end my turn.

00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:26.251
You can still win.
Yeah.

00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:28.854
I know my chances
don't look too good,

00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:31.123
but when we're working
as a team,

00:18:31.123 --> 00:18:33.258
nothing can ever stop us.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:36.428
Exactly.

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:37.663
Then let's go!

00:18:40.332 --> 00:18:43.068
Yes!

00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:44.202
You now have everything
you need to win.

00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:46.438
Right.

00:18:46.438 --> 00:18:48.440
I'm summoning Ganbara Knight!

00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:56.281
Next up, I'm overlaying
my Level Four Gagaga Gardna

00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:59.718
and Ganbara Knight!

00:18:59.718 --> 00:19:02.254
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:19:02.254 --> 00:19:05.691
I Xyz Summon Heroic
Champion... Excalibur!

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:17.202
That's more like it!

00:19:17.202 --> 00:19:18.737
I'll follow that up
by equipping

00:19:18.737 --> 00:19:20.872
Magnum Shield on Excalibur!

00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:23.675
Thanks to this shield,
Excalibur's defense points

00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:26.211
are added to its attack points.

00:19:33.752 --> 00:19:37.122
Only 4,000 points?

00:19:37.122 --> 00:19:38.790
Please.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.858
That's clearly not
enough to win this duel.

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:42.260
Okay Excalibur, use your
special ability!

00:19:43.762 --> 00:19:45.931
When it uses all
its Overlay Units,

00:19:47.432 --> 00:19:49.935
Excalibur doubles its
attack points during battle!

00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:53.705
Do it now, Yuma!

00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:55.907
Watch out, 'cause I'm
feelin' the flow!

00:19:55.907 --> 00:19:59.277
Excalibur, demolish
that Shark Fortress!

00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:02.748
Shock Sword Slash!

00:20:18.997 --> 00:20:22.434
Mission accomplished!

00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:34.379
Oh no, Shark!

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:36.415
Are you okay?

00:20:36.415 --> 00:20:38.383
I'm fine.

00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:39.818
Thank you.

00:20:39.818 --> 00:20:41.019
Your challenge was exactly
what Yuma needed.

00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:44.156
You helped him to
regain his fighting spirit.

00:20:44.156 --> 00:20:46.758
I am grateful.

00:20:46.758 --> 00:20:48.059
Hey, don't thank me.

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:49.294
I only challenged Yuma
'cause he annoyed me.

00:20:49.294 --> 00:20:51.863
And yet, you clearly tried to
help Yuma overcome his fear.

00:20:52.798 --> 00:20:56.234
No, that's ridiculous!

00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:59.438
Shark, thank you.

00:20:59.438 --> 00:21:01.239
You're a true friend.

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:03.375
Look, don't get all
emotional or else.

00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:06.311
You've annoyed me
enough for one day.
But I...

00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.880
(Astral) Observation Number 22:

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.049
Humans express their friendship
in many different ways.

00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:15.253
Some do it quite loudly,
while others speak volumes

00:21:15.253 --> 00:21:18.423
with their silence.

00:21:18.423 --> 00:21:19.858
(Shark)
...totally
make that happen!

00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:21.026
(Yuma)
Aw, come on, Shark,
don't be like that.

00:21:21.026 --> 00:21:22.861
Come here, let's hug it out.

00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:24.763
Get away from me.

00:21:24.763 --> 00:21:25.897
I mean it, you're
gonna ruin my threads!

00:21:25.897 --> 00:21:27.432
I prefer the latter.

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:30.068
Ruin your threads,
you can't ruin Polyester.

00:21:30.068 --> 00:21:32.437
Did you say Polyester?
