flying to the floor for
a ten count!

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.537
(screaming)

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.656
(groaning)

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.762
You... traitor...

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.064
How dare you!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.765
Whose side are you on, Alito?

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.133
We were given a mission!

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.636
We need that kid's
Numbers to save our world

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.305
and it's our job to take "'em
any way we can!

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.175
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.110
I know what I need to do!

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.977
What the huh?

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:41.347
You mean you're from Barian?

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:48.555
So why are you
standing in my way?

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.189
Oh, you know why.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:52.659
I already told you I'll
beat Yuma and Astral by myself!

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:54.027
There's too much at stake!

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:57.530
We can't afford to
take any chances this time.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.066
This Yuma's a lot tougher
than you think!

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.734
He's a great duelist!

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.635
I know.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.737
That's why I want
to confront him all alone.

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.474
I'll beat him and then take
all of his Numbers,

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:08.741
proving I'm the best!

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.244
My loyalty is to Barian World,

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:14.347
but I'm a duelist first!

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.115
Alito!

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:18.318
That's why I decided
to settle this my way,

00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:20.186
by dueling with honor!

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:24.390
It's a disgrace to rig
a battle the way you did!

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.693
Now get out of here!

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.172
You will duel me, won't you?

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:39.572
Hold up!

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:42.742
If I accept I'm gonna have
to put my Numbers on the line,

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.144
right?
Of course.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.646
But Yuma, we'll both
be dueling for Numbers

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.681
and for our very survival.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.215
Survival?

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:52.552
I'm willing to risk
everything to duel against you!

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:55.121
I'll beat both you and Astral!

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.756
He is
determined to confront us.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.294
Like it or not, sooner or later
we will have to face him.

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:04.297
Then why wait?

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:05.098
Let's do it!

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:09.736
You're so eager to battle us,
then bring it on we're ready!

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.738
I knew you wouldn't
let me down!

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.507
And I promise
not to disappoint.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:18.077

Yeah!

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.739
I'm ready!

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:49.542

♪ ♪

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:14.133
(Yuma)
I can't believe
Alito's a Barian!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:17.070
If he wins, he'll take
all our Numbers!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.405
I'm going first, Yuma!

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.040
The battle begins now!

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.111
I'll start by summoning
Battlin' Boxer Headgeared!

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.252
And since I can't
attack on the first turn,

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.121
I can summon a second
bruiser to my field.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:39.158
Go to your corner,
Battlin' Boxer Sparrer!

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:44.097
Alito now has two Level 4
monsters on his field, Yuma.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.767
I overlay both my Level 4
Battlin' Boxers!

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:52.538
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:56.509
and Xyz Summon Battlin' Boxer
Lead Yoke!

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:04.217
We faced the same monster
last time we dueled him.

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:05.051
Oh, yeah...

00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.320
When Lead Yoke uses
an Overlay Unit,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.089
you can hit it as hard
as you like in battle,

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.758
but it's impossible to destroy.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:16.162
And on top of that,
it gains 800 attack points!

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.467
He kept clobbering me with
this monster in our last time

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.468
and he almost won!

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:26.639
I place three cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.074
Your move, Yuma!

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:29.742
What is he up to?

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:33.446
It is possible he is setting up
the same "counter" strategy

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.214
he tried before.

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:35.748
That was genius!

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:38.351
Alito "countered"
every move against him

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:39.686
and it made him even stronger!

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:42.755
I barely managed to
figure out a way around it.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.691
Only this time
the stakes are greater,

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:47.093
so we must expect
the unexpected.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.429
Stop stalling and
make a move already!

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:49.795
Here goes!

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.766
Whatever your strategy is,
I'm gonna win this my way!

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.269
I draw!

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:01.174
I'll start with one of my go-to
monsters, Gagaga Magician!

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:06.546
And since it's a
Level 4 Gagaga monster...

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.283
I can summon another
Gagaga from my hand!

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:13.119
It's playtime little fella!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.056
I'm gonna activate
its special ability!

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:19.425
As quick as it can polish
off an ice pop,

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:23.529
it's goin' to Level 4,
just like Gagaga Magician!

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:29.035
And now I'm going to overlay
my two Level 4 Gagagas!

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:34.140
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.678
and Xyz Summon Number
39: Utopia!

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.119
Soon you're gonna be all mine.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:51.724
And just like you, I'll put
three cards facedown!

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.659
So, I see you're
trying to negate

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:55.762
my counter strategy again!

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:56.429
Maybe.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.765
For now though, I'll end my...

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.600
Sorry, but you're not
ending anything

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.503
till I activate my
Overlay Flash spell!

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:03.868
A spell?

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:06.739
He's pulling a fast one
to catch Yuma off guard!

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:10.510
Overlay Flash uses up one
of my Battlin' Boxer

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.011
Lead Yoke's Overlay Units

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:16.582
in order to negate the special
abilities of your Utopia!

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.220
No!

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.757
Your mighty Utopia is
now totally vulnerable.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.526
But that's not your
only problem!

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:29.195
Since Lead Yoke just
lost an Overlay Unit,

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:32.432
it gets 800 attack
points stronger!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.668
His tactics are more
aggressive than I expected.

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.237
If only there were some way
you could activate

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:39.739
your Fiery Fervor card.

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:42.108
Since his monster's attack
points have increased,

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.745
you could use that trap to
double Utopia's attack points.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.714
But since you just placed
it facedown,

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.749
we cannot activate it.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:54.220
We have found ourselves in
a most precarious situation.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.623
I guess I'll finally
end my turn now.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.659
It's my move...
I draw!

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.662
Lead Yoke strike down Utopia!

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.399
This resembles the attack
on Gauntlet Launcher

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.633
in your last duel.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.234
You're right!

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:11.637
So I'll do what I did
last time, use Battle Rush!

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.575
This trap protects my monster so
you can't destroy it in battle,

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:16.342
but that's not all!

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.579
Any damage I would have
taken... you take instead!

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:23.382
You're gonna have to do way
better than that, Yuma.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:27.753
I can easily counter it
by using Fancy Footwork.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989
This trap destroys your trap!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:34.193
So once again it's
bye-bye Battle Rush!

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.528
But I can trump
your counter move

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:37.630
just like the last
time we dueled!

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.667
I activate another
trap card... Xyz Strike!

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.568
When you activate a trap

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.670
when two Xyz
Monsters are battling,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.974
my Xyz Strike destroys
your trap!

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:53.746
Next, I'll draw
one card from my deck

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:55.748
and if it happens to
be a monster card,

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.450
then it's bad news for you.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.752
That's because Utopia
and Lead Yoke

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.153
will switch attack points...

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.356
but Lead Yoke's points
will become zero

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.091
until the end of the battle!

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:07.493
If you thought I'd
fall for that trap again,

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:10.196
you underestimated
me big-time!

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.298
I'm gonna outmaneuver
your counter move

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:14.400
by activating Counter Clash!

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.368
What's that!?

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.736
He was planning this all along!

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:19.739
It's a trap card that targets
a trap you activated

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.742
during battle and
wipes it out completely!

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.144
And as an added bonus

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:29.415
Counter Clash doubles the damage
you take during this battle!

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.752
Lead Yoke has 500 more
attack points than Utopia,

00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:36.088
so you're taking a thousand
points of damage!

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.357
Lead Yoke, attack Utopia!

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:41.561
Knock it out and
send Yuma flying!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.635
Lead Yoke, attack Utopia!

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:53.372
Knock it out and
send Yuma flying!

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.508
(grunting)

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:04.083
I'll turn it over
to you now, Yuma.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.018
That move was outstanding!

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:08.754
I could sense that you were
totally feelin' the flow

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.755
on that last attack.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.758
And now I'm feelin'
more charged up than ever

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:13.759
about this duel!

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.760
That's the spirit!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.762
Let's take it to
the next level!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.763
We'll go at it head-to-head,

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.632
leaving it all
on the duel field,

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.968
'til the best one's
left standing!

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:24.470
He sounds just like Yuma.

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:26.739
All right then.

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:28.374
You better watch out, Alito,

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:31.744
'cause I'm not pullin'
any punches!

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:32.178
Yes!

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:36.182
I'll start my turn by activating
the spell Xyz Revenge!

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:38.551
It's time to start
makin' my comeback!

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:40.720
Since your Xyz Monster
has an Overlay Unit...

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.490
I can summon an Xyz monster
from the graveyard!

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.758
Come on back, Utopia!

00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:49.161
Utopia's at full strength
and ready to rumble!

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.763
This spell also lets my Utopia

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:54.467
steal one Overlay Unit
from yours!

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.405
I'm glad you took
that Overlay Unit,

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:03.676
because you just made Lead
Yoke 800 points stronger!

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.650
Bad move!

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.286
Now that Xyz Monster's gonna
be even harder to beat!

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.522
Maybe... or maybe not.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:17.757
Use your trap.

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:18.591
I will!

00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:22.028
I activate my
Fiery Fervor trap card!

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:24.463
Since Alito's monster
gained attack points,

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:27.066
this trap can now be equipped
on to Utopia.

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:32.405
Fiery Fervor doubles Utopia's
attack points, just as planned!

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:36.742
He just pulled off a
perfect counter move.

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:39.178
And I fell for it!

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.313
It's now or never, Utopia!

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.549
Give it all you've got!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.755
Strike Lead Yoke with Rising Sun
Double Flare Slash!

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:06.338
(groaning)

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.544
That's it, Yuma.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.179
Finish him off!

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:13.746
He can't.

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.048
Not on this turn anyway.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.316
Trust me, guys.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:19.752
It's far from over.

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:22.988
So Yuma could still lose...

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:25.157
Come on!

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:29.061
We still have lots of
battling to do, Alito!

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.198
Yeah.

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:33.299
You're right.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:33.766
Let's go!

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:37.703
(Astral)
It seems Yuma and Alito are
perfectly matched as opponents.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:42.541
I am curious how this duel will
evolve moving forward.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.642
(gasping)

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:49.648
This Barian Sphere Field is
starting to drain my powers...

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:55.221
just at the moment Yuma will
most need my help!
