WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.160
Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.530
Weasel: ...shark's...
in... trouble...

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.990
he and the other guys are
gonna break into the museum

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.730
and steal that rare deck.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.560
They're probably gonna make
shark take all the blame.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.030
Scorch: Who are you?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.460
Yuma: I'm the kid
that's gonna stop you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.530
from doing what
you're about to do.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.830
If you guys wanna take
another step forward,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.890
you're both gonna
have to duel me!

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.530
CHILLS: What's the Wager?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.360
If you manage to defeat me,
then my number card is yours!

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.490
But if I win, then you
walk away from this museum.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.090
This isn't two on one.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.460
This is gonna be a
three on one battle.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.130
You ready, shark?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.630
SHARK: Actually...

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.790
it's gonna be two on two.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.460
Together: Let's duel!

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.990
I summon number 61!

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.430
Volcasaurus!

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.130
And say hello to
a world of hurt!

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.160
Your number card's
as good as ours.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.690

You shouldn't have
messed with us, you two.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.560
You shoulda stayed at
home in your pajamas.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.630
I think my partner
meant to say,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.890
you shoulda stayed in
your crib, in your diapers!

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.790
TORI: Oh no.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.360
They're laughing at us.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.860
Yeah you're right,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.830
but don't worry cause we
have the advantage now, yuma.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.330
Volcasaurus used up all it's
overlay units already.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.830
Alright!

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.290
So that means no
more special ability!

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.560
Hmph,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.760
that maybe True pipsqueak,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.730
but I didn't need it to
take out shark anyway.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.260
Cause you see, my volcasaurus
can attack him directly!

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.690
Look out!

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.460
I activate my trap!

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.160
Zeus' breath!

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.530
This card can blow off
your monster's attack!

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.330
It looks like you
lucked out this time.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.890
Whew!

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.190
That was a close one.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.590
You think you're safe now?

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.430
There's only one
way This is ending.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.590
You're gonna lose, and
utopia's gonna be ours!

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.830
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn!

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.190
My go then...

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.760
I draw!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.760
Goblindbergh,
take to the skies!

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.890
When goblindbergh flies
to the front line,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.960
it can pick up a level
4-Or-Below monster from my hand

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.760
and transport it to my field!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.060
So please welcome,
gagaga magician!

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.090
I hope you know how
to pull this off!

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.190
ASTRAL: Yuma,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.390
please wait!

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.960
Suddenly, I am
feelin' the flow!

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.790
Time for a little overlay
action with gagaga magician

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.930
and goblindbergh!

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.130
With These two monsters,
I build the overlay network.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.530
I xyz summon,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.190
number 39 - Utopia!

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.930
Alright,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.060
now we're talking!

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.360
BRONK: Aargh, I can't
watch. It's too lame!

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.130
All he does is
rely on utopia.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860
Together: Ooooooohhh!

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.960
Look chills,
a number card.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.760
Whatever will
we do, scorch?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.090
Oh Wait, I know. I'll activate
the avalanche trap card and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.830
freeze your utopia
in it's tracks,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.360
preventing it from ever
being able to attack!

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.560
Ahh!

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.760
Utopia!

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.560
How do ya' like that, kid?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.590
Your big bad
monster's been iced!

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.590
And guess what? If you're
thinkin' of usin it's special

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.090
ability - Don't bother,
cause if you do,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.890
you'll be takin'
500 points of damage.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.290
Seriously?

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.930
Well wait a minute,
maybe I can still find a...

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.130
forget it yuma, they
shut utopia down.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.490
You know, I tried
to warn you.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.860
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.160
Of course you're ending
your turn, pipsqueak.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.360
There's nothin' else
that you can do.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.960
But there's a lot
more that we can do!

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.690
For instance, I can shift
icebergdon into attack mode!

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.960
And know what else I can do?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.630
I can have icebergdon
attack shark directly!

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.790
Bye Bye, traitor!

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.090
The only thing going Bye-Bye
is your monster's attack!

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.690
I activate utopia's
special ability!

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.430
Yuma, don't!

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.130
If you use that, you're
gonna get slammed

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.560
by that avalanche trap!

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.130
I'm not afraid to
take a little damage.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.060
Go light wing shield!

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.730
If a hurting is what you want,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.160
then a hurting is
what you're gonna get!

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.490
[screaming]

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.690
if I didn't know any better,

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.560
I'd be wondering if
yuma summoned utopia

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.930
just to protect shark.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.860
Yuma, you shouldn't
have done that.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.430
Aah, what friendship.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.860
I'm so moved by this
touching display.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.930
So moved, that I think
I'll you attack again.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.160
Pompadour blizzardon,
attack shark directly!

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.590
I activate utopia's ability!

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.330
Go Light wing shield!

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.860
Yuma, you alright?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.130
Argh!

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.390
That kinda smarts...

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.690
yuma...

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.060
are you just gonna
sit there, or are you

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.630
gonna stand up and battle?

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.760
Alright chumps,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.460
I hope that's not
the best you've got!

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.360
My grandma duels way better
than you guys and like...

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.860
she's old.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.930
I think pipsqueak's
tryin' to trash talk.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.560
Well this should
shut him up.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.160
I activate the volcanic
ash trap card!

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.760
Using this card's power,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.130
I can put chills' pompadour
blizzardon in defense mode!

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.790
Uh, anyone know why he'd
put his teammate's monster

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.430
in defense mode?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.730
Thanks for the hook-up.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.660
Now, I activate the power of
the frozen ice cave spell card!

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.360
It can increase the
level of a monster

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.230
on my field in defense mode!

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.330
Oh, that's why!

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.160
So pompadour blizzardon
becomes level five!

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.690
That's two level
fives now. Not good.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.860
I think you both know what's
about to happen next.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.330
I overlay icebergdon and
pompadour blizzardon!

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.160
I hope you fellas
brought your jackets,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.460
'cause the weather outside's
about to g asty!

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.360
I xyz summon number 19:
Freezerdon!

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.960
Shark, they got
two number monsters!

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.930
And I think it's time
I help out my partners

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.290
by activating freezerdon's
special ability!

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.960
So by using One overlay unit,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.290
I can restore all of
volcasaurus' overlay units!

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.790
No way!

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.160
That is quite an
interesting tactic.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.290
Now that it's got
it's overlay units back,

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.630
it can knock us
around some more.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.190
That's convenient.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.090
I place two cards
facedown, and end my turn.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.890
No one can stand up to the
one-Two punch of fire and ice!

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.360
This is not right.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.860
Something is strange.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.030
They're cheating, yuma.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.660
They are?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.830
Cheating? What a sore loser.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.390
Don't play dumb!

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.260
I know a cheater
when I see one.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.360
And, I'm looking at two.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.730
A cheetah?

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.690
Does he mean a large cat?

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.930
Cheater, not cheetah!

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.530
It's someone who
breaks the rules!

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.390
You mean...

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.660
I see!

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.090
They are being dishonest!

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.260
Figures you losers
wouldn't play it straight.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.860
I'm gonna guess you worked out
a tagteam strategy in advance.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.530
You figured out the
cards you needed,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.690
and then rigged your duel

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.490
disk shuffle systems
to give 'em to you.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.890
No way!

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.230
That's why they both just
happened to have level fives in

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.460
their hands When they activated
those egg traps!

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.760
So when scorch Used volcanic
ash to put chills'

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.390
monster in defense mode,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.690
he did so knowing Perfectly Well
that Chills would then be able

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.660
to increase blizzardon's level
by Activating frozen ice cave.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.590
They always know what
the other is holding,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.060
and what they will draw next.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.790
If that is truly the case, then
these two are not True duelists!

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.290
I can't believe you guys
call yourselves duelists.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.190
You're just a couple
of cheating nobodies!

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.830
Tread Lightly, little shark.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.530
Cheating's not a word you
wanna be tossing around.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.960
Meaning the pot shouldn't
call the Kettle black!

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.960
Everyone knows you cheated
during the nationals!

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.990
You talk like a champion,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.590
but a True champion wouldn't
Peek at his opponent's deck in

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.160
the waiting room
during the FINALS!

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.560
Announcer MALE: Weeks
of watching duelists

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.490
crush each other's dreams
have led to this!

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.990
Announcer FEMALE:
That's right, Ron!

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.960
The National duel tournament
Finals are here, and the

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.030
excitement in this
Arena has been

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.330
turned all the way
up to eleven!

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.930
this is it, this is my moment,
i have to win this thing.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.290
...that's right, Meghan!

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.590
I know it's right, Ron.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.260
Newcomer Reginald kastle has
managed to climb a mountain of

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.990
obstacles to become
the odds-On favorite.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.490
is that his deck?

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.130
Will he rise to this final
challenge or will he buckle

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.760
under the weight of
expectation and pressure?

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.930
We'll find out after
a word from our sponsor!

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:55.690
CROWD: Shark! Shark! Shark!
Shark! Shark! Shark! Shark!

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.790
I got this.
Just one more turn...

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.030
I place one card facedown,
and end my turn!

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.890
a Facedown card...
it's gotta be...

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.690
the card I saw before...
mirror force.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.230
this match is mine.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.330
My turn!

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.660
I...

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.730
whoa, ladies and
gentlemen, hold up!

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.330
Kastle has been disqualified!

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.760
Security Caught some footage of
the hopeful finalist looking at

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.230
his opponent's deck minutes
before the duel started!

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.830
What Happened after that?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.560
Oh right, the league banished
you for life and now you'll

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.590
never duel in a
tournament again!

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.990
Bummer!

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:38.530
I looked for five seconds, I...
I was so scared of defeat.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.460
Was the wittle Bitty baby
afraid to lose the big duel?

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.030
Talk about pathetic!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.230
Mommy...

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.290
losing makes me cry!

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.890
Waaaaah!

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.360
Stop it!

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.030
Why are you jerks laughing?

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.690
There's nothing funny
about letting your

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.660
fear get the best of you!

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.630
I should know,
cause I've been there.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.690
When I was dueling shark,
I thought it was all over.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.530
And so I busted
out a number card

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.590
even though I said I wouldn't.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.190
I told myself I had
to, for shark.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.690
But I realize that's
not really why I did it.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.990
I just couldn't stand to lose.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.060
Poor guy...

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.230
I betrayed myself out of fear.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.360
I lost the duel and I lost a
piece of what makes me - me.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.690
I never wanna make
that mistake again,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.590
and shark feels
the same way.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.060
So even if our backs are to the
wall and all hope seems lost,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.760
we're gonna fight from the
heart, fair and square!

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.560
That's the difference
between us and you!

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.790
Heh!

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.190
What a sweet little speech!

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.530
Speaking of backs to the wall,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.230
all you've got on your field is
a monster on ice. You're done!

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.390
Yuma...

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.560
huh?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.390
Let's take these clowns out.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.290
Yeah!

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.590
It's my turn!

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.790
I draw!

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.590
First, I'm activating
a spell card!

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.360
Xyz gift!

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.030
When there's at least two xyz
monsters on the field,

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.490
I can use xyz gift to
draw two more cards.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.560
Next, I summon needle sunfish!

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.660
Now I activate the surface
spell card from my hand!

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.330
This allows me to summon one
water monster from my graveyard!

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.330
So watch out, 'cause big
jaws is coming back for more!

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.730
Do it, shark!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.060
And now I overlay level 3
needle sunfish and big jaws!

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.360
With These two monsters,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.130
I build the overlay
network and xyz summon

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.760
Black Ray lancer!

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.830
What's up, big guy?

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.360
Next, I activate black ray
lancer's special ability!

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.130
By Using One overlay unit,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.430
I can stop volcasaurus from
using it's special abilities!

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.890
You what?

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.990
Now we can destroy
that number card!

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.160
Except that volcasaurus
has more attack points!

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.830
Oh Yeah, about that...

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.960
I activate needle sunfish's
special ability!

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.090
Since This guy was sent
to the graveyard,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.690
volcasaurus loses
500 attack points!

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.230
Aw, yeah!

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.790
Now Black ray
lancer is stronger!

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.560
Shark really turned
the situation around.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.990
What are ya' waiting for black
ray lancer, attack volcasaurus!

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.660
Go Shimmering Spear slash!

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.160
I activate
compensation exchange!

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.830
This trap card Stops Black
ray lancer's attack,

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.930
but now, my life points
get hit with all

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.090
of volcasaurus'
attack points.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.990
Thanks a lot. You just
had to get in the way.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.190
He takes the hits,
and I dish 'em out!

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.760
That's how the leaders
of the pack roll.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.460
And now I activate
volcanic abyss!

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.630
With this card, I can check out
one of your hands and if there's

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.090
a monster card, it gets sent
back to your deck. Let's see...

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.690
you holding any monster
cards, pipsqueak?

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.260
He's talking to
me, isn't he?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.760
Yes he is, and he is trying to

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.330
stop you from summoning a
monster on your next turn.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.390
Aaah, are you serious?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.460
gogogo Golem
AND monster reborn...

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.030
monster reborn.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.660
there's no way that pipsqueak
knows how to use that.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.260
You got a monster, now you have
to send it back to your deck.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.160
Sorry, gogogo golem.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.590
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.030
And now I'll end you!

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.090
My move!

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.330
I draw!

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.160
Get ready to feel
the heat, shark!

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.230
Cause I'm activating
volcasaurus' special ability!

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.560
Magma Max!

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.090
First, volcasaurus destroys
Black Ray lancer!

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.030
And then you take damage
equal to black ray

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.790
lancer's attack points!

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.730
Nighty-Night, shark!

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.230
Look out!

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.560
You're finished!

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.430
Volcasaurus, take out shark's
black ray lancer!

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.730
And now shark,
say goodbye!

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.390
Not so fast!

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.260
I activate damage diet!

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.790
This trap cuts shark's
damage in half this turn!

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.760
And now,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.430
I activate icy crevasse!

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.630
So now I can destroy
one of your monsters,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.490
and then strike you
with damage equal to your

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.230
monster's attack points!

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.790
So you're tryin' to take out my
partner and his monster, are ya?

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.360
Well by Activating forced
change, I can make

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.290
freezerdon and me
take the fall instead!

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.430
[Screaming]

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.860
alright!

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.360
One down, one to go!

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.530
Why you little pipsqueak...

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.790
nobody messes with the chills!

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.530
I use volcasaurus' ability
to destroy utopia!

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.030
Oh man...

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.230
Damage Diet activate!

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.860
I'll finish you in a sec,

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.290
but now volcasaurus,
attack shark directly!

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.930
I play the final
offering trap card!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.190
With This trap card's power,
I can force a battle to stop by

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.030
pulling one card from my hand,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.860
and giving it
to another player...

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.260
like yuma!

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.330
Wha...

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.430
you mean you're...

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.090
are you sure you
can trust me with it?

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.330
Yup.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.660
That card is...

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.590
lucky break for you!

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.060
But, now I activate
the twin volcano spell!

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.130
This card explodes
for 500 points of

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.430
damage during each
of my turns,

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.060
and it erupts with
500 points of damage

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.530
when I send it
to the graveyard!

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.430
Eh whoa Wait,
that means...

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.660
as soon as it
becomes his turn again,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.060
he will be able to
defeat the both of you.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.230
You little runts
are done for.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.230
Not that you
ever had a chance!

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.790
That's where you're wrong.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.490
You guys are the
ones who're done for.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.890
Hope you're right.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.560
I draw!

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.130
Okay Now, um... if uh...

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.190
the answer's right
in front of you!

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.060
focus.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.830
you have to play
this right, yuma.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.990
okay, if I use monster
reborn on Utopia, then...

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.830
oh wait!

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.760
armored xyz!

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.760
this was shark's card.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.160
that's it!

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.390
What you failed to recognize is
that monster reborn can also

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:37.130
bring back a monster from
another player's graveyard.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.960
I play the spell
card, monster reborn!

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.360
Is he really gonna
bring back utopia?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.190
No bronk, I'm reviving black ray
lancer from shark's graveyard!

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.330
You could have brought out
a game changer like utopia,

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.590
but instead, you just
brought out a game ender!

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.990
You could have brought out
a game changer like utopia,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.560
but instead, you just
brought out a game ender!

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.930
I don't think so.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.160
You don't?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.930
From my hand, I activate the
spell card... armored xyz!

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.560
That doesn't sound too good.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.130
All of a sudden, you two losers
aren't looking so confident.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.690
The power of this card allows me
to equip one monster on my field

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.830
with one xyz monster
in my graveyard!

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.090
Utopia, rise!

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.330
And now I equip black
ray lancer with utopia!

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.230
That's nice that you made your
lancer stronger, but did you

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.090
forget that only a number
can destroy a number?

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.730
We've got that covered!

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.030
TOGETHER: What?

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.660
As far as technicalities
are concerned,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.330
black ray lancer now
has utopia's powers.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
So basically, black ray
lancer is a number now!

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.130
Do you realize
what this means?

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.160
Volcasaurus is
goin' extinct!

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.860
Black Ray lancer,
attack volcasaurus!

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.360
Your partner's outta
the picture, and you've

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.490
got no monsters
to hide behind.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.460
I think it's safe to say
that you're about to

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.890
get officially yuma-Ed!

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.990
Cause By sending utopia
to the graveyard,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.230
black ray lancer can charge in
again and attack you directly!

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.490
Aarghh, no way!

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.590
Go Shimmering Spear slash!

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.090
[Screaming]

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.090
Woo!

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.230
They won!

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.130
Ya' did it, yuma!

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.430
Observation #12: Not every
duelist in this world duels with

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.790
honor. Some are willing to
compromise their spirits

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.730
as long as it means winning.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.460
Wha... What happened
to us chills?

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.830
I dunno. I don't
remember nuthin'.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.630
look!

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.760
It's shark!

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.060
Run away!

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.260
That's what I thought!

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.730
Don't you mess with us again!

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.560
Hey bronk...

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.590
I'm sorry I used a number
against shark when I said

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.090
I wouldn't, I'll never break
a promise again, I promise!

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.130
Uh Yeah... Well... Uh...

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.990
forget about it, yuma.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.930
Let's just drop it
and have a duel.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.130
Uh...

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.230
yeah you're on, bronk!

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.730
Right now?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.790
I'm outta here...

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.630
Wait up!

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.630
There was um...
Oh, right!

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.660
Your armored xyz.
Don't you want it back?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.790
Nah...

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.960
keep it.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.130
You sure?

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.130
Yeah.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.060
You can use all the
help you can get.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.990
I'm the one who helped you!

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.130
Later.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.360
Later, shark.
