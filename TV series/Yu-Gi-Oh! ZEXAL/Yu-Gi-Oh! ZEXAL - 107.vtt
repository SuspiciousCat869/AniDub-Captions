WEBVTT

00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:02.488
You selfish little weasel!

00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:06.259
You said you would be
home for dinner, remember?

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.893
That was, like, forever ago!

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:09.862
Kari, it's not really
Yuma's fault.

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:13.933
Yeah, you should listen to Tori.
She's not a weasel.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.201
I know my grandson.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:18.004
I'm sure he was just off
dueling somewhere.

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.340
Right! I just had
the adventure of a lifetime.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.976
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna
shorten that lifetime!

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:26.145
(woman on TV)
<i>...fascinating discovery.</i>

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.514
Hi, Haru. Hi, Yuma.

00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:30.249
(laughs)

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.418
Hey, check it out.
That's Master Roku!

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:36.455
(clears throat)
On the grounds of Mr. Roku's
duel sanctuary,

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:39.225
a stone statue honoring
the famous warrior,

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:40.326
Commander Kiraku,

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:41.394
has recently been unearthed,

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:44.130
and it's causing quite
a local sensation.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.766
I've seen that face before.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.135
I'm very pleased to have
him with us today.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:50.336
(both) It's Girag!

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:54.040
Just what kind of person
was Commander Kiraku?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.443
Hmm. He was a formidable
warrior.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.812
He defeated
many corrupt leaders

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:01.147
and distributed the riches

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:04.417
that he won in his battles
to his own subjects.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:06.185
His generosity was celebrated,

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:10.122
and, as a result, he is still
a beloved local legend.

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:14.126
That's Girag's face,
no doubt about it.

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:16.195
And a number of other objects

00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:18.097
were discovered along
with the statue?

00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:21.767
That's right. We found some
interesting items.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.437
Remnants of Kiraku's treasure.

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:28.507
(gasps)
I think that's
one of my dad's coins!

00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:30.943
I am certain that it is.
How?

00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:33.145
The map that displayed
the location

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:34.213
of the Mythyrian Numbers

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:36.415
indicated that one was
at the duel sanctuary.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:39.518
Ah! Then what are
we waiting for?

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:40.986
You little...

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:42.488
Bye, Kari.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:44.090
Hey! Come back here!

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.495
(singing in native language)

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.864
This is a joke.

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:54.467
All I do day after day

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:59.505
is wander around looking
for Numbers.

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:02.108
(grunts)

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:03.809
<i>Obviously this</i>
Commander Kiraku...

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:08.047

This thing is freaky.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.127
It's really creeping me out.

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:32.865
It's a Number Card!

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:36.235
Kiraku.
Huh?

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.304
Aah! Uhh!

00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:41.507
I've been waiting
for you, Kiraku.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:43.409
Huh? It talks!

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.012
Commander Kiraku is
the spitting image of Girag.

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:49.048
I wonder why they
look like each other.

00:03:49.048 --> 00:03:52.117
Maybe he's Girag's Barian
granddad or something.

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:53.519
(yelling) Huh?

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.488
(yelling)

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.490
Look out!

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.491
Yuma!

00:03:58.491 --> 00:04:00.926
(both yelling)

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:03.195
Aah!

00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:08.334
Yuma!

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:10.503
(groans)

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:12.104
Are you okay?

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:14.373
(groans)

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.345
(laughing) Huh?

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:21.514
(high-pitched voice)
Finally.

00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:25.985
Finally, I'm free!

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:27.353
Girag.

00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:29.088
Girag!

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:31.490
Who?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.293
Quit fooling around.

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:35.294
(scoffs)

00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:36.028
Hey, wait, stop.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.497
It's me, Yuma Tsukumo!

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:43.002
Oh. I'm honored
to meet you, Mr. Tsukumo.

00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:45.504
Now, please excuse me.

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:48.507
But, Girag, I...
Hold it!

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.412
(grunting)

00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:57.349
Give me back my body!

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.051
Did you guys hear that?

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.519
How can a statue talk?

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:03.489
I ain't no statue!
It's me, Girag!

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:05.090
That's messed up.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.192
How could this have happened?

00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:07.993
I don't know,

00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:10.496
but I got sucked into
this statue somehow!

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.334
The me that's over there
is a Number guardian!

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:15.901
Huh?

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:17.503
This is rather astonishing.

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:20.105
So the real Girag's a statue,

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:22.474
and the statue's
the real Girag?

00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:23.876
That can't be!

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:26.979
Oh, no?
I'll prove it to you.

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.516
You always swipe food
from that girl's lunch box

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:31.850
when she's not looking.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.254
I know 'cause I seen you do it!

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:37.756
Ugh! And I kept
blaming my mother

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:40.059
for not giving me
enough to eat!

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.393
Who're you gonna believe, Tori?

00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:43.896
Me or some big, ugly
talking stone statue?

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:48.067
And you better believe I didn't
forget about our duel!

00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:53.339
I crushed you with
Giant Hand, remember?

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.506
(both gasp)

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.775
Then you really are Girag!

00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:58.077
(laughs)

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:01.146
Yes, that's right.
We exchanged places.

00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:04.516
So from now on,
I'm Commander Kiraku.

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.952
But how'd you exchange places?

00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:09.788
I've been trapped inside
of that stone statue

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:10.990
for a very long time,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.392
waiting for the day
when I could be free again.

00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:16.795
And the moment Commander Kiraku
appeared before me,

00:06:16.795 --> 00:06:18.430
I knew that day was today.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.134
It seems that the legendary
Commander Kiraku

00:06:22.134 --> 00:06:23.502
really is Girag.

00:06:23.502 --> 00:06:24.436
Uhh!

00:06:24.436 --> 00:06:26.505
Yuma, you gotta
beat him in a duel

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:28.807
and make him give me
my body back!

00:06:28.807 --> 00:06:30.976
Why would I want to help you?

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:33.812
'Cause he has a Number.

00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:35.047
Yuma.
Huh?

00:06:35.047 --> 00:06:39.485
If he has a number,
we must do it.

00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:41.754
You're right.

00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:43.856
Listen up, whoever you are.

00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:45.224
Get ready to duel.

00:06:45.224 --> 00:06:46.792
If that's what you want.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:49.228
I waited a long time
for my freedom,

00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:51.397
and I'm not giving it up now!

00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:53.465
All right, then!

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:55.501
Yaaah!

00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:58.337
Duel Disk! Go!

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:03.842
Duel Gazer!
Let's roll!

00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:09.515
(computer voice)
Augmented reality vision link
established.

00:07:09.748 --> 00:07:11.666
(both) Let's duel!

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:15.718
(both) Let's duel!

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:18.121
You've got to win this, Yuma!

00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:19.722
Yeah. Please.

00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:22.458
Well, this should be fun.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:23.493
My turn.

00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:24.294
I draw!

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:27.730
I summon Baby Raccoon Ponpoko!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.134
Oh! What a cutie!

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:35.738
Next, I'm activating the spell
card Leaf Transformation!

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:39.742
It lets me summon another
of my furry friends

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:40.743
to join the band!

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.746
Come on out,
Baby Raccoon Tantann!

00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:46.749
They will not be here long.
Yeah, I know.

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.119
I overlay Level Two
Baby Raccoon Ponpoko

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:53.122
and Baby Raccoon Tantann!

00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:54.057
With these two monsters,

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:57.660
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.732
Number 64:
Ronin Raccoon Sandayu!

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:11.741
That's the fifth Mythyrian
Number, Astral.

00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:16.512
I activate Ronin Raccoon's
special ability!

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:18.748
Once per turn, I can use
an Overlay Unit

00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:22.318
to summon one Kagemusha
Raccoon Token!

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:23.486
And check it out.

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.521
These pelty pals
have the same number

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.657
of attack points as each other.

00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:28.491
(groans)

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.661
Then, as long as this Token
is on my field,

00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:33.629
you're not allowed
to attack my Number,

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:35.498
so it's protected from anything

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:37.333
you're thinking of
throwing my way.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.669
With that, I end my turn.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.506
My move. I draw.

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:45.308
All right.
Super sweet.

00:08:45.308 --> 00:08:47.744
You know what to do.
Oh, yeah.

00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:48.745
Huh?

00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:51.414
I place one card facedown!

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:54.250
(thinking) What's he planning?

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.721
Whatever it is,
it's time to ruin it!

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.659
Yuma.

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:09.298
You have... whiskers.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.401
Huh?

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.070
How come I'm over there?

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.739
He must have...
switched bodies.

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:18.708
Hey, that's cheating!

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.743
Now he can see my card.

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:25.648
Hmm.
What have we here?

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.484
(sinister laugh)

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:31.154
When there's no monster
on my field,

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:36.726
I can summon this pathetic and
weak Toy Knight from my hand!

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.728
That is the wrong play, Yuma.

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:40.730
Astral! Tori!

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.666
I'm him...
I mean he's me!

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.234
Well, I can't tell who's who.

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:49.138
Tori, this guy is me.
This is Yuma!

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:52.742
(crying)
And I did swipe food
from your lunch box!

00:09:52.742 --> 00:09:54.043
I'm so sorry!

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:56.479
Let's talk about this later.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.114
I told you he did it!

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:01.184
Yuma, you are not you.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.718
(sinister laugh)

00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:04.353
Give me my body back!

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:08.724
(laughs)
I'm the master of
your body now,

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:10.726
as well as your cards.

00:10:10.726 --> 00:10:12.728
So what shall I do?

00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:15.531
Ah, yes. This will do
just the trick.

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:18.367
Since I have that
facedown card on your field,

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.735
I can summon Dododo Witch!

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.672
The optimal move
is to Xyz Summon now.

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:27.543
I tribute Toy Knight
and Dododo Witch!

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:28.111
Don't do that.

00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:30.446
But it's the perfect way to
totally mess up your game!

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:36.519
(sinister laugh)
I summon Dododo Swordsman
in attack mode!

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:38.721
Hyah!

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.724
That's terrible!

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.493
Yuma could have
summoned Utopia,

00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:45.094
but that plan has been foiled.

00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:49.732
Now I'm activating
the spell card Monster Reborn,

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.435
so I can bring back Toy Knight
from the graveyard!

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:55.571
Next, I'm activating
the spell card Guard Plus.

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:57.573
I send Toy Knight
to the scrap heap

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:00.042
so that Dododo Swordsman
gains defense points

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.745
equal to that
lame toy's attack points.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.746
Bye, bye, Toy Knight.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.283
Dododo Swordsman gains
200 defense points!

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:10.419
That doesn't help.
It's in attack mode!

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:11.521
Now, Dododo Swordsman,

00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:13.689
it's time for you
to take off and attack!

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:16.025
Fine! But you finally
made a mistake,

00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:18.728
because you're the one
who's gonna take damage!

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:21.998
We'll see about that.

00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:23.599
Hey. What...

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:26.169
(grunts)

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:34.477
Aah!

00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:41.751
I like being back
in Kiraku's body.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.719
(groans)

00:11:43.885 --> 00:11:44.220
Uhh!

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.456
Okay, whatever you are,
enough is enough.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.058
What's your story, huh?

00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:52.461
I was Kiraku's body double.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.363
His shadow warrior.

00:11:54.363 --> 00:11:56.132
Shadow warrior?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.733
Kiraku was a hero,

00:11:57.733 --> 00:11:59.335
and all the people loved him,

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.104
but they never knew
that it was actually me.

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.739
Who would have thought
the greatest,

00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:06.142
most fearless warrior
of their time

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.443
was actually a raccoon.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:09.605
(all) A raccoon?

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:16.385
You just said you're
a raccoon, right?

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:19.354
This is an interesting
development.

00:12:19.354 --> 00:12:22.791
Kiraku and I first met
on the battlefield.

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:25.527
I had been caught
in a fierce battle.

00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:29.798
When it was over,
he saw me and saved me.

00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:32.601
To repay him, I used my powers

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.538
and transformed into Kiraku
and became his double,

00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:38.140
his "shadow warrior."

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.077
I battled in his place.
I was strong and clever.

00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:44.813
I won his wars,
conquered his enemies,

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:47.816
and the people
hailed me as the hero.

00:12:47.816 --> 00:12:51.520
But he became suspicious
and jealous of my power,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.255
so he sent me away.

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:56.291
When Kiraku finally
went into battle himself,

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.793
he lost everything.

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:02.397
If he had only trusted me,
I would have won.

00:13:02.397 --> 00:13:04.666
He deserved what he got.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:09.404
Eventually, I followed Kiraku
into the great beyond.

00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:10.806
But I found myself trapped.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:13.675
My soul was destined
to spend eternity

00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:19.214
sealed inside that lifeless
statue of Kiraku.

00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:22.117
I refuse to be a shadow!

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.419
I will be a real warrior!

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:25.420
You're a thief!

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.358
Yuma, you gotta beat him
and get my body back!

00:13:29.358 --> 00:13:30.559
Do not forget.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.793
There is a Number on the line.

00:13:31.793 --> 00:13:35.163
You must defeat this shadow
warrior at all costs.

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.499
Yeah, Astral, I know.

00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:38.800
Hey, you, listen up.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.635
I'm not a big fan of Girag.

00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:43.338
He's a bully, a cheater,
and a liar.

00:13:43.338 --> 00:13:45.307
And those are the good things.

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:46.808
Wait, did he...

00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:49.311
Keep your comments to yourself!

00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:51.346
But, see, the thing is...

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:54.716
I still can't bring
myself to punish him.

00:13:54.716 --> 00:13:55.183
Yuma.

00:13:55.183 --> 00:13:56.785
You don't have
to punish Kiraku.

00:13:57.018 --> 00:14:00.789
I dislike that guy enough
for the both of us.

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:03.792
My turn! I draw!

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:07.429
I activate Ronin Raccoon
Sandayu's special ability!

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:11.433
It uses an Overlay Unit to
strengthen my furry forces!

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:14.703
Ronin Raccoon Sandayu, attack!

00:14:14.703 --> 00:14:16.505
(growls)

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:20.809
I'm not done!

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:24.613
Kagemusha Raccoon Token,
go get 'em!

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.348
(growls)

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.786
Aah!

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:35.090
Now when my last Kagemusha
Raccoon Token attacks,

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.527
you two are through!

00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:42.764
That's not gonna happen.

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:45.700
(thinking)
Hmm? Is he talking about
his facedown card?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.571
I thought he only played it
to summon Dododo Witch.

00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:50.305
No way.

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:53.175
You're not gonna trick me, kid!

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:57.479
Kagemusha Raccoon Token,
attack him!

00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:59.815
All right, I activate my trap!

00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:01.817
Burst Rebirth!
Burst Rebirth?

00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:03.652
By giving up half
my Life Points,

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:06.021
I can summon a monster
from my graveyard

00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.256
facedown in defense mode.

00:15:08.256 --> 00:15:11.393
Welcome back, Dododo Swordsman.

00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:14.396
Dododo Swordsman?

00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:16.765
Kagemusha Raccoon Token,
retreat!

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:19.034
(growls)

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:21.803
(thinking) It's okay.

00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:25.540
I still have exactly
what I need to win this.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.444
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:15:29.444 --> 00:15:33.648
Well then, I draw!

00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:41.089
I summon Dododo Swordsman
in attack mode!

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.492
(grunts)

00:15:43.492 --> 00:15:46.061
Why would you do that?
You have no attack points.

00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:49.631
Not so! When Dododo Swordsman
is flipped over,

00:15:49.631 --> 00:15:51.199
it gains attack points!

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.803
Yeah, the difference between
my life points and yours.

00:15:54.803 --> 00:15:55.804
(groans)

00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:58.807
That's 3,500 points.

00:15:58.807 --> 00:16:01.643
(grunts)

00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:05.280
Dododo Swordsman has another
special ability:

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.385
it can slice and dice
two monsters on your field!

00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:13.522
My monsters!

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:19.261
Dododo Swordsman, get ready to
cut that Raccoon down to size!

00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:21.796
(growls)

00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:31.806
(groans)

00:16:31.806 --> 00:16:32.707
It's time!

00:16:32.707 --> 00:16:36.244
I activate the trap
Raccoon Reversal!

00:16:36.244 --> 00:16:38.813
Not only do I destroy
your Dododo,

00:16:38.813 --> 00:16:41.816
but you take damage
equal to its attack points!

00:16:41.816 --> 00:16:42.817
You've been outfoxed,

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:45.453
or should I say,
out-raccooned!

00:16:45.453 --> 00:16:50.592
Victory is mine,
and so is my freedom!

00:16:53.628 --> 00:16:56.431
Victory is mine,
and so is my freedom!

00:16:56.431 --> 00:16:58.800
So sorry to disappoint you!

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.802
What's that card?
What's it do?

00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:04.205
By sending Chow Chow Chan
to my graveyard,

00:17:04.205 --> 00:17:08.343
it not only stops your
trap card's effect,

00:17:08.343 --> 00:17:11.212
but I get to use
its effect instead!

00:17:11.212 --> 00:17:11.813
(barks)

00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:15.817
The effect of Raccoon
Reversal is all mine now.

00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:18.687
This can't be.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:24.492
Destroy Ronin Raccoon Sandayu!

00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:25.360
Now you take damage

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.196
equal to your furry friend's
attack points.

00:17:28.196 --> 00:17:31.366
That's a thousand points!

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.105
Dododo Swordsman, attack him
directly with Brimming Blade!

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:38.807
(grunts)

00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:41.810
Aah!

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.813
That's can't be happening!

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.584
Ponta!

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.129
(gasps)

00:18:01.129 --> 00:18:01.563
Huh?

00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:05.066
I can't... I can't believe
I lost the duel.

00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:07.302
I... I'm a failure.

00:18:07.302 --> 00:18:09.804
No, you're my friend.

00:18:11.506 --> 00:18:12.641
Master?

00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:15.443
It's been a long time, Ponta.

00:18:15.443 --> 00:18:18.146
Am I hearing what
I think I'm hearing?

00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:21.316
Girag really is
Commander Kiraku
after all.

00:18:21.316 --> 00:18:23.585
Why did you send me away?

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:27.722
Because I knew that final
battle would end in defeat.

00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:29.457
No! You know that's a lie!

00:18:29.457 --> 00:18:32.260
If you had only let me
lead the troops...

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.395
No.
What?

00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:35.196
The nobles who
didn't like the fact

00:18:35.196 --> 00:18:38.366
that I was distributing
their riches to the poor

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:40.101
plotted against me.

00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:41.236
By the time I realized,

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:43.805
there was nothing
I could do to defeat them.

00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:45.573
I knew I had to make sure

00:18:45.573 --> 00:18:48.376
that you would survive
and be free.

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:52.247
(crying)
You should never
have done that!

00:18:52.247 --> 00:18:56.685
I would have rather been
with you to the very end,

00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:58.086
fighting by your side!

00:18:58.086 --> 00:19:00.155
A friend never leaves a friend.

00:19:00.155 --> 00:19:03.792
If we battled together,
I know we could have won.

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:06.628
(sobbing)

00:19:09.597 --> 00:19:11.700
I want you to have the Number.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.636
Thank you for reuniting
the two of us.

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:17.505
Okay, Astral.

00:19:26.247 --> 00:19:27.816
(both gasp)

00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:30.218
Master Kiraku.

00:19:30.218 --> 00:19:31.753
Oh, my little furry friend.

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:35.457
You fool! You think
I actually care about you?

00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:38.460
I faked it so I could
get my body back!

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.465
I sent you away once,
and I'll do it again!

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:44.799
Oh!
Oh!

00:19:45.033 --> 00:19:46.201
Don't do it, Girag!

00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.804
See ya!
Ha ha ha ha!

00:19:49.804 --> 00:19:52.807
You all fell
for that stupid story

00:19:52.807 --> 00:19:55.443
of me trying to save
this furball?

00:19:55.443 --> 00:19:59.447
That just proves
how dumb you all are!

00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:02.450
You better get ready for the
next time we meet,

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.718
Yuma Tsukumo,

00:20:03.718 --> 00:20:06.788
'cause it'll be
the last time.

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:12.260
I'll be ready, so bring it.
