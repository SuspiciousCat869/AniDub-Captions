WEBVTT

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.590
Yuma: Aw man, this is just my
luck!

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.130
I get my third
heart piece,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.530
and then,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.930
it won't fit!

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.390
Why me?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.730
It's not like I swiped the
thing, I won it fair and square!

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.160
Tori: I don't know
what to say, yuma.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.990
Hearts have a funny shape.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.690
Maybe the piece you have isn't
the one you need to complete the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.030
puzzle.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.030
See, there could be
tons of combinations.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.190
Tons?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.390
So what are you saying?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.560
I might have to win
a thousand pieces?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830
Astral: Not to
pile it on, but...

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.260
heart pieces are not the only
thing we are here to win if you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.890
recall.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.990
As you said, our main goal
entering the duel carnival is to

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.630
retrieve numbers cards.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.090
When did I say that?

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.360
I never said that!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.530
I want heart pieces!

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.660
I love heart pieces!

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.830
I need heart pieces!

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.990
I can't live
without Heart pieces!

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.160
Anna: Target acquired!

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.830

look out!

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.390
Just missed him.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.390
This augmented reality is
getting a little too

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.490
real if you ask me!

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.960
Augmented reality?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.860
This is real, yuma!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.590
One more time.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.530
This way!

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.060
Come on!

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.660
Stay still, would ya?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.730
Astral, whaddya see,
whaddya see?

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.830
From what I can tell,
you are under attack.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460
No joke, genius.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.130
Quick Tori, this way!

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.890
Right!

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.630
You can run...

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.730
but you can't hide,
not from my hovercraft.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.260
And we have liftoff!

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.060
There is no escape!

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.690
She's right behind us, yuma.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.330
What are we gonna do?

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.760
I suggest running faster.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.630
And now I... got ya!

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.090
Look out!

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.960
There, we made it.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.160
There's no chance that
she'll find us way up here.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.430
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.690
Any last words?

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.000
Cuz now's the time...

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.830
uh, you okay?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.560
Quiet, I'm taking you out!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.290
You know you have it coming!

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.890
Hold on,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.990
why do I have it coming, I don't
even know you, you sure I'm the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.790
one you want to blast?

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.230
Ha...

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.260
I'm absolutely sure,
I'd never forget you,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.460
yuma tsukumo!

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.290
Hold on, is that you, Anna?

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.560
Anna?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.160
Yeah, Anna kaboom from school,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.560
don't ya remember?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.190
She transferred
out two years ago.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.060
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.330
So I'm easy to forget?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.930
Is that what you're
suggesting, yuma?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.090
No, no!

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.230
I remember now!

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.730
It's crystal clear!

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.360
I could never forget
someone So charming as you!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.190
Wait, so why exactly are
you after yuma, Anna?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.590
I'm after him because
I want to get my revenge!

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.130
Get your revenge?

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.690
Got that right!

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.030
For what he did
to me back then,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.460
or, didn't do.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.790
Huh?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.860
You see?

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.890
Right there,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.060
that's the problem!

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.130
You're completely
and totally oblivious!

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.460
Oh just shush!

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.030
I think I know
what's going on here...

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.260
you...

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.630
you never noticed me.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.390
What do you mean, why
should I have noticed you?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.360
I'll tell ya why!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.830
Because I put glue on
the bottom of your shoes,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.290
I scribbled notes all
over your duel disk,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.760
I cut little holes
in your gym shorts.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.360
I hid rocks in your duel fuel.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.430
Really, you did all
those things to me?

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.560
Wow.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.790
Ya know,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.130
you'd really think
I'd remember all that.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.530
You're telling me!

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.830
How could you not know I was
head over heels in love with

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.230
you?

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.830
That's why I was trying
to get your attention.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.560
But nothing I did worked.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.760
Then, I had to transfer
to another school!

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.090
I asked you to meet
me after class.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.730
I waited and waited but
you never showed up.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.260
That's when I
made a solemn vow.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.330
I'll get you for this, yumaaaaa!

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.260
And now it's time for payback!

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.730
So get ready yuma tsukumo,
cause I'm here to collect!

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.890
Wait!

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.090
Just hold on a sec,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.460
before you start
collectin' anything,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.760
maybe there's another
way to teach me a lesson.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.260
Ya know, by doing something
that'll really make me suffer.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.030
Like beating me in a duel!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.430
a duel, huh?

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.930
Yuma, Anna wants to blast
you, not duel with you.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.360
She'll never go for it!

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.490
Works for me.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.730
Let's do this.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.160
It just so happens,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.790
I've always known how
much you like dueling.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.760
So I thought you
might suggest this!

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.290
At least he's safe for now.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.530
However, if I win our match then
you have to become my boyfriend.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.260
Cool?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.760
No way you'll be winning,
so that's fine with me.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.060
Yuma!

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.490
Alright, then let's get started!

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.190
Duel disk, extend and set!

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.130
Duel Gazer activate!

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.090
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.030
Now let's duel!

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.790
Human Love is such
a peculiar thing.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.130
And packs such
serious firepower.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.830
Ladies first in this match,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.090
so here I go.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.860
It's my draw!

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.860
For my first move, I'm
summoning rocket arrow express!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.860
It's got 5000 attack points!

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.290
That train's gonna
derail my duel!

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.130
How was Anna able to summon such
a strong monster on her first

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.730
move?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.660
This card can only be summoned
when I have no other cards on my

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.130
field.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.660
So, since my field
was empty, voila!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.290
However, to keep
this card out there,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.660
I'll have to send five cards
from my hand to the graveyard

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.090
every turn.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.630
Five cards every turn?

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.560
Aw, I don't know what you're up
to, but I don't like it one bit!

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.990
However, I can't attack on the
turn rocket arrow Express is

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.460
summoned, and when it's on the
field, I can't place any other

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.060
card facedown so...

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.130
I end my turn!

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.660
Which means you're up, yuma.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.930
So bring it on!

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:21.960
Right!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.090
Here I go!

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.260
I draw!

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.530
Yuma!

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.460
Rocket Arrow is too powerful
to take down this turn.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.730
Right.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.330
So I'll just set the
stage for Next turn then.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.030
First up, I'm placing one
monster facedown in defense

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.430
mode.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.890
Then I'll place another card
facedown and end my turn.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.930
Playing hard to get, are you?

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.360
I'll fix that!

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.090
I draw!

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.160
I choose to discard zero cards,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.730
which means rocket
arrow's wrecked!

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.230
Oh my...

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.790
next I'll place five cards
facedown and then,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.560
end my turn.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.060
What?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.660
Why'd you get rid of that
super powerful monster?

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.160
Now you left yourself
totally defenseless?

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.630
I guess love does work
in mysterious ways.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.490
Now come on yuma, and give me
your very best shot!

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.490
Alright, you want it,
you got it!

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.790
My turn!

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.030
I draw!

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.290
First up,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.930
I summon gogogo giant!

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.390
Now gogogo giant
attacks you directly!

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.560
And if it hits, you'll be taking
2000 giant points of damage!

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.260
Now go!

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.590
Wait yuma, what about the five
facedown cards she has out?

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.490
I destroy all facedown
cards on my field!

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.560
Go on, get lost.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.130
What?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.960
And now I'm gonna summon to the
field snow plow hustle rustle!

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.890
I'm allowed to summon it when
you attack me directly, simply

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.860
by destroying all the spell and
trap cards that I have out on

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.590
the field!

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.190
But enough talk, let's
just plow ahead!

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.060
Whoa, 2500 attack points?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.530
Gogogo giant, quick,
call off the attack!

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.060
Oh, you're not getting
off that easy yuma!

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.090
Snow Plow hustle rustle,

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.260
I'm activating your
special ability!

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.630
Now, you take 200 points of
damage for every spell and trap

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.190
card I destroyed to summon it.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.730
So with five cards destroyed,
that's a thousand points!

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.230
Yuma!

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.560
A thousand down,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.530
and 3000 points to go!

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.460
So Anna planned This move
from the very beginning?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.330
That does seem to be the case.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.490
Yes!

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.060
I'm so gonna win this
and then you'll be mine!

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.860
So let's hurry up
and finish this!

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.560
You must be careful yuma,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.930
I have a hunch Anna is
setting up something big.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.490
Uh-huh, I know.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.390
I just hope we can
stop whatever it is.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.460
What do I do?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.790
I don't know, but I hope
you figure it out.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.060
Moving on,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.230
my draw!

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.990
And...

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.830
it's just the card I wanted.
Go special schedule!

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.660
Thanks to this spell card, I
have the green light to summon

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.190
one machine-Type monster With
3000 or more attack points from

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.760
my graveyard in defense mode!

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.430
So, all aboard!

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.660
Cuz Rocket arrow
express is now back!

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.230
and it's like I'm tied
to the tracks.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.690
Two level 10 monsters?

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.960
This is not good.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.190
I know in years past,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.230
I could never get
your attention.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.660
But I have a hunch

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.790
that this next move will!

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.460
I now overlay Level 10 rocket
arrow and hustle rustle!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.890
And with This overlay network,
I can now summon...

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.360
an xyz monster!

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.260
Appear, superdreadnought
rail Cannon!

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.590
3000 attack points?

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.330
So this is what she has
been angling for.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.690
But the best part of this
choo-Choo is the change it

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.260
undergoes when I
activate it's ability!

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.660
But don't take my word for it,
see for yourself!

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.490
Once per turn, by using one
overlay unit, you now take 2000

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.990
points of damage!

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.790
I gotta say, that
thing's pretty cool.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.530
But it'd be a lot cooler
if it wasn't pointing at me!

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.830
Now, superdreadnought,
unload on yuma!

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.160
Go Cataclysmic Cannon kablooie!

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.760
Yeah, yippee!

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.190
I'm winning,
I'm winning, I'm winning!

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.830
There's just 1000 life points
left before you lose, yuma.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.260
And once you've lost,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.690
you know what that means.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.090
For the rest of your life,
you're all mine!

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.960
So what do you say handsome?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.690
Let's make that dream come True.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.560
Go superdreadnought,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.830
attack gogogo giant
and win this duel for me!

00:13:30.433 --> 00:13:31.733
Watch out!

00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:33.163
It's cool cuz I play

00:13:33.163 --> 00:13:35.663
the trap card overlay Buster!

00:13:35.663 --> 00:13:41.093
Now my monster Gains 500 attack
points until the end of battle!

00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:50.333
Clever move, yuma!

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:52.133
So you survive this turn,

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:55.063
but I promise you
won't survive the next one!

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:56.993
Ya know I hate to admit it,

00:13:56.993 --> 00:13:59.133
but with superdreadnought's
special ability, Anna may

00:13:59.133 --> 00:14:01.793
just be right.

00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:04.163
I have to take that train off
the tracks but with it hauling

00:14:04.163 --> 00:14:07.663
3000 attack points,
it won't be easy.

00:14:07.663 --> 00:14:09.493
Maybe not, but it is possible.

00:14:09.493 --> 00:14:12.033
Then what are you
waiting for, tell me how!

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:13.993
I cannot just blurt it out.

00:14:13.993 --> 00:14:18.233
At least, not without
a proper drum roll.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.263
A drum roll?

00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:21.793
I got it!

00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:25.393
It's time to high five the sky!

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:26.963
Here we go,

00:14:26.963 --> 00:14:28.363
draw!

00:14:28.363 --> 00:14:31.533
First I summon zubaba Knight!

00:14:31.533 --> 00:14:34.263
Zubaba Knight!

00:14:34.263 --> 00:14:37.963
Next I summon rai Rider!

00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:46.733
Then I overlay level 3 zubaba
Knight and rai Rider!

00:14:48.563 --> 00:14:51.933
And now that I have, I can build
the overlay network and xyz

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.233
summon!

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:55.433
Now,

00:14:55.433 --> 00:15:00.133
here's the drum roll
you asked for, astral.

00:15:02.093 --> 00:15:05.933
Welcome temtempo
the percussion djinn!

00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:07.133
Ha!

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:08.963
He's Only got
1000 defense points.

00:15:08.963 --> 00:15:10.363
Yeah that's True,

00:15:10.363 --> 00:15:12.763
but it's his special ability
that you should really be

00:15:12.763 --> 00:15:14.763
worried about, Anna!

00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:18.463
You see, when temtempo uses one
overlay unit, your xyz monster

00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:22.633
loses all of its overlay units.

00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:24.233
It does what?

00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:27.093
And then, for every overlay unit
that was sent to the graveyard,

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.493
temtempo gains
500 attack points!

00:15:30.493 --> 00:15:32.963
Told ya he could jam!

00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:36.393
And jam up superdreadnought cuz
now you can't use it's ability!

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:39.363
Correct, and since temtem
tempo is in defense mode, we

00:15:39.363 --> 00:15:41.433
will not take
battle damage either.

00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:45.133
I now place two cards
facedown and end my turn!

00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:47.933
But don't think you're
ending this duel!

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:50.963
Make all the moves you want
yuma, but I'm going to win you

00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:53.203
yet!

00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:58.463
You're not gonna beat me, yuma!

00:15:58.463 --> 00:16:00.833
You can make all the moves you
want, but I'm still going to win

00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:02.563
you yet!

00:16:02.563 --> 00:16:04.063
It's my turn!

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.563
I draw!

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:08.233
And first up, I'm activating
the equip spell known as train

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.163
connection!

00:16:10.163 --> 00:16:13.663
Now, by banishing two level
8-Or-Above machine-Type monsters

00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:16.633
in my graveyard, I can equip
train connection on a

00:16:16.633 --> 00:16:19.433
machine-Type monster and double
it's attack points so I can

00:16:19.433 --> 00:16:21.793
really stay on track!

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:24.693
Yeah, I'll say!

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.793
6000 attack points?

00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:39.463
Anna's really outdone
herself this time, astral.

00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:41.563
And I do not even think
she is done yet.

00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:44.763
And I've got more news, due to
train connection's effect, when

00:16:44.763 --> 00:16:48.033
the equipped monster attacks a
monster in defense mode, if it's

00:16:48.033 --> 00:16:51.133
attack points are greater than
your monster's defense points,

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:53.933
the difference is dealt
to you as damage.

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:56.463
Carry the one, subtract the
remainder, divide the square

00:16:56.463 --> 00:16:57.633
root...

00:16:57.633 --> 00:16:59.233
ah!

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:01.333
I'll take 5000 points of damage
if your attack gets through!

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.763
That's right, which
would mean that

00:17:03.763 --> 00:17:07.493
the duel's over and
you're mine, sweet-Ums!

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:11.933
Aw, don't tell me that you're
gonna cry like that time before.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:13.933
What time before?

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:17.033
Oh you remember.
When I took your card!

00:17:17.033 --> 00:17:19.333
If you want your card back
yuma, you'll just have to come

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.793
up here with me!

00:17:20.793 --> 00:17:21.963
But I'm afraid of heights.

00:17:21.963 --> 00:17:23.433
C'mon, give it back!

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:25.633
I was just playing around with
you but then you started tearing

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.793
up.

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.193
C'mon, just toss it down
already, would ya?

00:17:28.193 --> 00:17:29.693
Wait a sec...

00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:31.033
but I'm not afraid of heights.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:32.133
Well you were back then!

00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:33.263
Was not!

00:17:33.263 --> 00:17:34.793
I was only afraid of
spiders and the dark

00:17:34.793 --> 00:17:36.363
and toes!

00:17:36.363 --> 00:17:37.533
Guess I'll just have
to jog your memory

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:39.663
by Knocking some sense into you!

00:17:39.663 --> 00:17:42.293
You're going down!

00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:44.163
That is not a good
thing to hear.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:47.293
Not when you only have a mere
500 life points remaining.

00:17:47.293 --> 00:17:49.233
You are not helping astral!

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:52.493
Then again, if you had the right
facedown cards, that could be

00:17:52.493 --> 00:17:54.763
great news.

00:17:54.763 --> 00:17:56.133
This is it, yuma.

00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.563
You're all mine.

00:17:57.563 --> 00:17:59.163
Of course!

00:17:59.163 --> 00:18:01.593
Go, superdreadnought
rail Cannon,

00:18:01.593 --> 00:18:04.593
attack temtempo!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.593
Oh no!

00:18:07.593 --> 00:18:09.793
Bash that little drummer boy!

00:18:09.793 --> 00:18:11.163
I don't think so!

00:18:11.163 --> 00:18:13.263
I'm playing the trap gamshara!

00:18:13.263 --> 00:18:15.863
With this card, my monster
Switches from defense mode to

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:20.093
attack mode!

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:23.833
Only 2200 attack points?

00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:27.063
Come on, you know that's not
enough to beat superdreadnought!

00:18:27.063 --> 00:18:29.463
I know that it's not, Anna.

00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:32.233
That's why I'm playing
this next card too!

00:18:32.233 --> 00:18:35.763
I activate the trap mirror mail!

00:18:36.493 --> 00:18:38.933
Now, my monster's attack points
become the same as your

00:18:38.933 --> 00:18:42.293
monster's attack points!

00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:47.893
Alright yuma,
way to feel the flow!

00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:02.493
No way!

00:19:02.493 --> 00:19:05.633
Oh and another thing, thanks to
the trap card gamshara,

00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:08.393
since your monster was
destroyed, you take damage equal

00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:09.833
to it's attack points,

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:12.633
which is 6000!

00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:14.433
Uh-Oh...

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.633
now,

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:17.193
do your thing gamshara!

00:19:17.193 --> 00:19:19.663
And let Anna know what it's
like to be on the other end of a

00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:22.693
Cannon blaster.

00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:33.833
I did it!

00:19:38.263 --> 00:19:39.563
No way...

00:19:39.563 --> 00:19:41.363
I lost.

00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:43.833
But how?

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.793
I'll tell ya how Anna, cuz ya
brought a giant Cannon to do a

00:19:46.793 --> 00:19:50.733
job that a Lesser
monster could've done.

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:53.493
Kinda like how you went way
overboard trying to blast me

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:56.863
earlier, when all ya needed
to do was ask me to talk.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:59.793
No!

00:19:59.793 --> 00:20:04.763
Um, I don't know if it's the
right time to say this, but...

00:20:04.763 --> 00:20:06.963
wasn't the person
you liked named

00:20:06.963 --> 00:20:11.093
KUMO Tsuyuma rather
than yuma tsukumo?

00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:13.193
Kumo tsuyuma?

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:15.163
Oh yeah, I totally remember him.

00:20:15.163 --> 00:20:17.363
He was that kid who cried a
lot and was really afraid of

00:20:17.363 --> 00:20:21.133
heights, right?

00:20:32.193 --> 00:20:34.393
Well it's your fault
for having a similar name.

00:20:34.393 --> 00:20:38.033
I hope that you've
learned your lesson.

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:41.333
Hey,

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:42.493
wait a second!

00:20:42.493 --> 00:20:43.633
What about my heart piece?

00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:44.763
Heart piece?

00:20:44.763 --> 00:20:46.193
What's that?

00:20:46.193 --> 00:20:47.593
It's what you give me
when you lose a duel!

00:20:47.593 --> 00:20:49.493
Well tough, I don't have one.

00:20:49.493 --> 00:20:51.793
Hold on, are you telling
me that you're not

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.363
even competing in
the duel carnival?

00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:57.863
Please, I've never
even heard of it.

00:20:57.863 --> 00:21:01.563
Well ya should've told me
that from the get go!

00:21:01.563 --> 00:21:04.463
Aw man, what a
complete waste of time!

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:07.693
I had a hunch something was
fishy from the very start.

00:21:07.693 --> 00:21:09.533
I mean why would a
girl ever like you?

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:11.533
Hey, I'm likable!

00:21:11.533 --> 00:21:13.433
It is a shame to see
her go though.

00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:15.233
Huh?

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.533
After all, those who duel for
love duel With great passion.

00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:20.163
Oh yeah?

00:21:20.163 --> 00:21:23.593
Well I'd love it if you keep
your theories to yourself.

00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:27.833
Yuma tsukumo.

00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:30.833
Cute.

00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:35.863
I blame you for
that yuma tsukumo,

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:37.793
and I'll get my revenge!
