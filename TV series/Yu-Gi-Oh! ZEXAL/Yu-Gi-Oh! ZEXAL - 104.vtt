WEBVTT

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.270
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.304
(Astral)
According to the map,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.306
the Number we seek is
somewhere here

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.408
in the ruins of Spartan City.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.176
(Yuma)
Whoa!

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.545
Check out
the duelist in the mask!

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.081
That looks like Nistro...

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.650
(Alito)
Strange...

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.621
I feel like I've walked
through here before.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.525
That card
is mine for the taking!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.162
(Nistro)
Hey!

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.498
What are you doing here?

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.069
Alito!

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.639
This Number is eager to
go into battle with me!

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.110
But if I wield it myself,
the risk would be too great.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.144
You're a duelist, right?

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.846
Then you'll love this card!

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.381
Check it out!

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.215
Hold on.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.449
This is a Number card!

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.317
That's right!

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:54.354
And you will now use it
to defeat Yuma for me!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.956
(Yuma)
Duel Disk, go!

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.024
(all)
Let's duel!

00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:00.694
(Nistro)
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.897
Number 54: Lion Heart!

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.301
That must be the Number
from these ruins!

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.136
Go, Lion Heart!

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:10.871
Pouncing Punch!

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.309
(yelling)

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.248
(Alito)
As a puppet,
he's very useful...

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.883
and completely disposable!

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.552
Alito, I can't believe
you're battling this way!

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:29.356
You wouldn't have sunk this
low when we dueled before!

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.324
That was then, Yuma.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:34.561
Now I'll do anything to make
you pay for defeating me!

I'll use Nistro to crush you

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.963
and get my
revenge for beating me!

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.633
Alito...

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:47.668
Yuma be careful.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.771
That Barian's Lion Heart may
be weak in attack points,

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:52.506
but I am afraid
that its special ability

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:56.176
makes it a serious threat
to both us and them.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:57.844
That's true.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.714
But by forcing Nistro to
do all the dirty work,

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.183
Alito's off the hook!

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.621
Those lights...
what are they?

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:08.288
They're spirits.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.757
Each blue light is the spirit of
a brave warrior

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.094
who once fought in this
coliseum and lost in battle.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:17.297
That is all that Alito requires
of me for now,

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.765
so I end my turn.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.902
Nistro, I'm gonna do
whatever takes to make you

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.470
snap outta this!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.138
I'm up!

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.239
Yeah!

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.843
Utopia, attack Alito's monster!

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.044
Big mistake, Yuma!

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:35.615
I activate Battlin' Boxer Rib
Gardna's special ability!

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.752
Now my Boxer can bob
and weave past your attack,

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:42.456
so Utopia has to attack a
different monster instead.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.092
That means Utopia has to
attack Lion Heart!

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.828
And Rib Gardna has
another special ability.

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:50.197
When Utopia attacks an
Xyz Monster,

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:51.965
all of Utopia's Overlay Units

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.366
are sent to the graveyard!

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.869
Oh man, that was a sneaky move!

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.838
This is not good, Yuma...

00:03:57.838 --> 00:03:58.572
That's right!

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.074
In fact, this is
the beginning of your end!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.676
Go, Nistro!

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.412
(Nistro)
Lion Heart's special ability
activates!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.714
Not only does
Lion Heart survive your attack,

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:12.486
but you take the same amount
of damage that I take!

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:18.492
(gasping)

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.827
This is going to
finish off Yuma and Astral!

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.028
That's right!

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:25.665
My revenge will
soon be complete!

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.167
(gasping)

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:29.936
♪♪

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.672
This attack will
finish off Yuma and Astral!

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.774
That's right!

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.943
My revenge will
soon be complete!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.948
I activate my trap
Butterspy Protection!

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:45.118
The amount of damage that Yuma
takes is cut in half!

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.486
Thank you!

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.290
(yelling)

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.228
(yelling)

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.099
Nistro, no!

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.168
Tough break for Nistro,
but at least

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:04.504
they don't have to
worry about Lion Heart.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.673
Is he okay?

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.642
Oh, Yuma...

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.477
Nistro will be fine...

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.479
thanks to another of
Lion Heart's

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.814
special abilities.

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.917
By using an Overlay Unit,
when Nistro's life points

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:21.221
become zero,
he regains 100 life points!

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.190
Go, Reviving Jolt!

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.861
(groaning)

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.166
Are you okay, Nistro?

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.201
This is remarkable!

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.670
As long as Lion Heart has
Overlay Units, it will be

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.406
impossible to knock
Nistro out of the duel!

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.908
(Alito)
True... but Nistro's
mind and body

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.511
will feel the strain
more and more.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.513
And you couldn't care less!

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.714
(chuckling maniacally)

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:51.418
I activate Butterspy
Protection's other effect!

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.485
Once the battle ends,

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:56.556
I'm switching your Lion Heart
to defense mode!

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:58.358
Good move!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.428
Lion Heart can't be destroyed
only when it's in attack mode.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:05.031
So in defense mode
it's vulnerable.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.333
That's it for now.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.201
I'm ending my turn.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:08.602
Nistro!

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:12.205
Stop letting that twerp treat
you like you're his puppet!

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.407
Me?
A twerp?!

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.376
You have to resist him.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.745
Put up a fight!

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.147
Your efforts are useless.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.551
I have complete control of him.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.087
(laughing maniacally)

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.456
Let's continue!

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.224
I draw!

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:35.228
I summon Battlin' Boxer
Rabbit Puncher!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.166
Then I'll overlay Rabbit Puncher

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.769
with my Battlin'
Boxer Rib Gardna!

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:46.539
Now I can use them to build
the Overlay Network

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:47.674
and Xyz Summon

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:51.444
Battlin' Boxer
Cheat Commissioner!

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.348
Cheat, Cheat.

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:05.392
Cheat Commissioner,
rough up Utopia!

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.261
It looks pretty tough,

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.263
but it's as harmless as a fly!

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.898
Do not count on that, Yuma...

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:15.702
Cheat Commissioner, time to
use your special ability!

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.170
When the Commissioner
is battling,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.773
it has the authority
to change every monster

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.075
on the field to attack mode!

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.209
(all gasping)

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.812
Forced Fighting Stance!

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.525
Your troubles are far from over!

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.329
Cheat Commissioner prefers to
keep the peace, not break it,

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:46.466
so it can have someone else
fight in its place!

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.704
Whoa, did you
see that switcheroo?

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:53.039
I did and I would say that we
have been placed

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.508
in a precarious position, Yuma.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.077
That's an understatement!

00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:00.280
In fact, I have you both
hopelessly beaten!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.248
(Dextra)
Not so fast, Barian!

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.951
I activate my trap
Butterspy Courage!

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.120
This'll make sure
you don't lay a claw

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.221
on Yuma's Utopia,

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.390
because your monster
now has to attack

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.926
my Butterspy instead!

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:18.431
Bring it, Nistro!

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:18.965
Dextra!

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.301
Are you sure you
wanted to do that?

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.608
(yelling)

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.548
You okay, Dextra?

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.751
I think I'll be all right.

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:39.986
What about Nistro?

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.956
I won't let Nistro
go down for the count yet.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.692
He's still got work to do.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.994
Go, Reviving Jolt!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.567
Nistro!

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.003
(Nistro groaning)

00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:01.174
(Alito)
He's almost
as good as new!

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.543
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.612
Your fans think you're a hero.

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.680
And a real hero
wouldn't let himself

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.916
get brainwashed by the bad guy!

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:10.784
Don't waste your time

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:13.653
trying to break Nistro
free from my control.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.856
He's completely under my power!

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.893
Not if I can help it, Alito!

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.896
I summon Morpho Butterspy!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.001
And...

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:31.971
that lets me also summon
Blue Mountain Butterspy!

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.881
I overlay Level 4 Swallowtail,

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.984
Morpho and Blue Mountain
Butterspies!

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.553
With these three monsters,

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.188
I build the Overlay Network!

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:52.025
I Xyz Summon Night
Papilloperative!

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.301
It's packin' some
major attack points!

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.870
(Astral)
Yes, but
against Lion Heart,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.705
all that power could
actually put it

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.408
at a distinct disadvantage!

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:09.509
But that's not all,

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.878
because I'm also
activating the spell

00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:12.946
Overlay Capture!

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.714
And that's bad news
for your Lion Heart,

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:17.550
because this spell seizes
one Overlay Unit from it

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.420
and gives it to my Xyz Monster!

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.388
Awesome!

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.691
Since Lion Heart
has no Overlay Units,

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.693
it will be unable to
revive Nistro.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:30.096
(Dextra)
Nistro, just a bit longer
and I'll have you free of

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.965
the Barian's control!

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.700
I know what you're up to.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.667
It won't work...

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:38.138
because I'm activating my
trap Xyz Battle Chain!

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.474
It stops your spell from
affecting my Xyz Monster!

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:45.945
So that means your Overlay
Capture captures nothing!

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:52.152
(Yuma)
You mean Lion Heart gets
its Overlay Unit back?

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.319
Yes!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.654
But it's worse than that

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.622
because Xyz Battle Chain

00:10:55.622 --> 00:11:00.827
also forces your delicate
bug to attack Lion Heart!

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:06.566
Prepare to strike, Lion Heart!

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:08.868
I activate Night
Papilloperative's

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.737
special ability!

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:12.572
By using an Overlay Unit,

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:15.441
Night Papilloperative
gains 400 attack points

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.944
for each Overlay Unit
on the field.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.580
Since there are five
Overlay Units on the field,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.082
it gains 2,000 attack points!

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.552
She's playing
right into my hands.

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:27.554
Her monster got
a major power boost!

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.055
But all those attack points

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.457
will be damaging Dextra herself!

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:32.859
She must know that,

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.563
but I think this could be her
way of sending a message.

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:37.297
(gasping)

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:38.765
Dextra must be
hoping that this exchange

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:42.635
will jolt Nistro and bring
him back to his senses.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:44.270
Attack!

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.173
Strike at Lion Heart with
all the force you possess!

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:50.276
Snap Nistro out of his trance!

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:51.978
Nistro, hear me!

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:55.114
Come back to your senses
before it's too late!

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.083
You're stronger
than that Barian!

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.819
Break free from his control!

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.122
(yelling)

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.228
(yelling)

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.263
Dextra!

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:18.605
Dextra, hang on, you'll be okay!

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.906
Sorry, Yuma.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.007
It's over.

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.208
I may be out of this duel,

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.110
but you can still use my monster

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.345
that's on the field.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.747
Night Papilloperative
can help you defeat

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.683
that Barian and save Nistro.

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:33.253
It's going to be
two against one now!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.922
Work your magic, Lion Heart!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.890
Bring back Nistro!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.359
(yelling)

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.094
(Alito)
Get up!

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.663
We have work to do!

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:44.964
Knock it off!

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:46.733
(laughing maniacally)

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:47.834
Now, Yuma...

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.802
I'll complete my
victory by activating

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.205
the trap Numbers Overlay Boost!

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.107
Did you feel safe
because Lion Heart

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.241
ran out of Overlay Units?

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.811
Too bad because this trap
changes two cards in my hand

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:02.382
into Overlay Units
for Lion Heart!

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:03.416
Rise, Nistro.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.119
Time for you to finish off Yuma!

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.587
Nistro...

00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:09.088
(Nistro)
It's my turn.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.423
I draw!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.893
(Alito)
He drew Barian's Force!

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:16.429
But with this next move,
Yuma will lose.

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.131
So we won't even need it.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.933
(Alito)
Well, Nistro,
what are you waiting for?

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.568
Attack with your Lion Heart!

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:27.073
Use its special
ability to destroy Yuma!

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:32.879
I activate the equip spell...
Stoic Challenge!

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:37.216
By sending all of Lion Heart's
Overlay Units to the graveyard,

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.218
I can equip it with
this spell card.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:43.323
Stoic Challenge powers up
Lion Heart by 600 attack points

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.325
for each Overlay Unit
that it lost!

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:49.329
And not only that, it also
doubles all battle damage!

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.664
No, that's not
what I want you to do!

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.665
In order to use this,

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.567
Lion Heart must be destroyed on

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.369
the next turn, however.

00:13:56.369 --> 00:14:00.340
Why is Nistro working
against Alito's strategy?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.873
That's not all!

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:05.011
I'm also equipping Lion Heart
with the spell Heroic Growth!

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.013
When I have fewer
life points than Yuma,

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:11.351
Heroic Growth doubles
Lion Heart's attack points!

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:19.192
It now has more
attack points than Utopia!

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.428
(yelling)

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.501
All right!

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:29.736
That's more like it!

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.304
I just knew the Nistro we know

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:33.773
was still in there somewhere!

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:38.311
Lion Heart, attack Utopia!

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.850
You're taking double the damage

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.619
thanks to Stoic Challenge.

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:51.124
With that, I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:53.893
What does he think he's doing?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.496
He wants to win this his way.

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:58.798
You've been dueling
like a coward,

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.733
but Nistro duels like a warrior!

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.636
Looks like Nistro's free of
Alito's control.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:04.670
Not really.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.240
Alito still has control of
Nistro's mind.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.309
And yet, when Dextra
attacked him full force,

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:12.478
it must've stirred something
inside Nistro

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.013
that rebelled against being

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:14.714
someone else's puppet

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:17.884
and made him want to duel
with all his skill and power.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:19.619
Nistro is battling with
the fury of

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:21.421
a true duelist now!

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.256
(yelling)

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.056
Nistro!

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:27.093
This showdown is gonna be epic!

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.961
Here goes!

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.329
I draw!

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.330
To get things rolling,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.333
I'll activate
the spell Xyz Shift!

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.101
This'll shake this duel up

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.904
because it lets me swap
Night Papilloperative

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:39.539
with another Xyz Monster.

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:42.475
Then I summon another
monster of the same Rank!

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:44.710
It's the most noble of
all knights...

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.814
Heroic Champion... Excalibur!

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.249
And the awesomeness
doesn't end there,

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:55.121
'cause Xyz Shift becomes
an Overlay Unit for Excalibur!

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:55.655
Nistro!

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:58.157
Remember that battle when
you gave me this monster?

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.393
You made me promise to
fight every duel

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:02.395
with everything I've got!

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.731
And that's just
what I plan to do!

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.934
I use all of Excalibur's
Overlay Units

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:10.369
to double its attack points!

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.771
Go, Excalibur!

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.973
Attack Lion Heart!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.476
Oh yeah?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.412
Well, I'm activating
Battler's Cry!

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.781
You doubled your
monster's attack points?

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:23.449
Well, two can play at that game!

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:26.919
I double my
monster's attack points too!

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:27.787
Amazing move!

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:30.890
Way to max out
the pressure on me, Nistro!

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.525
Yuma...

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:36.362
I counter your counter
with the trap Soul Strike!

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.331
By paying half of my
life points,

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.765
I can increase
the attack points of

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.902
my monster by the exact
same amount!

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:43.870
Yeah, why bother?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.505
You only strengthened Excalibur

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.206
by a 100 attack points!

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.444
What happened to Lion Heart?

00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:56.249
Yuma made that move so he'd have
the same life points as Nistro.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:58.484
No way!

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:02.021
Nistro's spell Heroic Growth
only works when he possesses

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.056
fewer life points than Yuma!

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:07.026
Nistro used an equip spell to
strengthen Lion Heart.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.295
Then Heroic Growth
doubled those attack points.

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.231
They were doubled again by his
Battler's Cry trap.

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.967
But now that Heroic Growth
has been neutralized,

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.370
Lion Heart loses attack points!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.439
Wait!

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.974
That means...

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:26.846
Excalibur, finish off
Lion Heart right now!

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.081
Not so fast, Yuma!

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:30.917
The only one finishing
anything off

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:32.218
around here is me!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.086
I activate Cheat Commissioner's

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.354
special ability!

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:37.323
I use all of its Overlay Units

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:38.024
to end the battle

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:41.093
and activate a spell from
another player's hand!

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.929
And I know just the one!

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.197
Nistro, activate Barian's Force

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:48.034
to pave the path to victory!

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:52.638
(growling)

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:53.773
Listen, Nistro!

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:56.809
I command you to activate
the spell Barian's Force!

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:58.878
Yuma, you must stop this!

00:17:58.878 --> 00:17:59.745
Right!

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.548
I'm playing
the trap Overlay Marker!

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:03.883
(gasping)

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:06.586
Since Cheat Commissioner
has no more Overlay Units,

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:10.022
this trap stops its special
ability and destroys it.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:13.726
Furthermore, you take damage
equal to the total attack points

00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:15.761
of the Xyz Monsters in battle!

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:19.498
And that total is 6,700 points!

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.605
There's no way I can take
all that damage and survive!

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.272
Exactly!

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.607
You deserve to get knocked out

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.109
after what you did to Nistro!

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.514
(yelling)

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.787
(Alito)
These memories...

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.724
Are they really mine?

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:49.395
(yelling)

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.172
It wasn't pretty,

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.074
but at least he pulled it off.

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.644
I don't understand...

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.647
Where did those
memories come from?

00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:12.518
Alito...

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.156
