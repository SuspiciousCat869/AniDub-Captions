WEBVTT

00:00:01.674 --> 00:00:03.507
(Mr. Heartland)
Welcome back, duel fans!

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.974
You're just in time to
join our 14 remaining

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.240
World Duel Carnival finalists
as they journey

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.741
into the next
section of our competition

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:14.574
known as the Dragon's Den.

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:16.474
Which of our finalists
will move on?

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.174
Which of our
finalists will go home?

00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:20.474
Only one way to find out!

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.607
Keep it here for
all the action!

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:23.607
Did you hear that?

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.407
Only 14 duelists
left!

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.141
And Yuma made it
by clawing his way

00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:28.941
through the competition!

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.074
Go, Yuma!

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:31.774
Just keep feelin'
the flow!

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:32.741
Yeah!

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.774
(Flip)
I sure hope Yuma
can flip things around,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.807
'cause right now he's
in last place!

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.541
It doesn't matter
where he is.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.207
You know he always
comes out on top!

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.407
Yeah, Cathy's right.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.707
In the end, Yuma always seems
to pull out a victory.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:50.207
Well, yeah, but he'll need
a flashlight this time,

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.507
'cause this underground
section is pitch black!

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.207
Which means Yuma won't
know what's lurking

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:57.841
behind each twist
and turn of the track.

00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.641
Well, as long as he keeps
feelin' the flow,

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.907
he's sure to see
his way to victory!

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:03.707
(Mr. Heartland)
And now, to explain what our

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:05.574
remaining finalists
need to do.

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:08.441
The goal is simple.

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:10.674
They have to get to one
of the four duel fields

00:01:10.707 --> 00:01:13.741
before their
competition does!

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.674
And those fields are:

00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:19.341
Magma, Space,
Jungle...

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:21.141
and Desert.

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:22.607
Each of the four fields
have their own

00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.341
set of advantages
and disadvantages.

00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:26.974
Duelists must race
to the one they

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:29.074
think will give
them the edge!

00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:33.207
And now, let's
get to dueling!

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.241

Anyone you hope
to duel against, Yuma?

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:42.907
(Yuma)
I'm not choosy.

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:45.107
Whoever I see first
is going down,

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.541
'cause I'm feelin' the flow!

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:49.574
Yuma, I do
hope you realize,

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:52.374
four duel fields, means only
eight people can duel.

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.874
No, that
can't be right.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.174
Two people to a duel,
and four fields,

00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:58.807
so let me see,
that makes...

00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:00.507
Two multiplied by
four is eight.

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.507
Right!

00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:02.507
Good math!

00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:04.207
Eight duelists!

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.241
Just eight duelists?

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:06.207
I gotta get movin'!

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.707
This map shows
I'm in first place.

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:11.607
Vetrix is currently
second.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.174
And Kite is in third.

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:17.441
Vetrix, I'm gonna
hunt you down.

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:20.607
Ooh, what fun!

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:23.674
The dark is sure to be
chock full of many surprises!

00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:26.174
I can't wait to see who
or what I find first!

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:28.007
(laughing)

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.374
Giggling fool!

00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:31.374
You won't be laughing
for very long!

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.674
I'm going to gather
as many life points

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:37.574
as I can
and finish you.

00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:41.707
I bet you didn't know

00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.941
it's feeding time,
Quattro!

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:45.541
And this shark's
getting ready

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:47.207
to sink its
teeth into you!

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:50.974
(Quattro)
It seems Reginald's
taken the bait!

00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:51.974
This is perfect.

00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:53.807
Just keep following
me, Shark.

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.007
I'll lead you
to your doom in

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:58.241
the one field I know you
don't stand a chance in.

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.741
(Quattro)
Since your deck is built
around water monsters,

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:01.774
I'm gonna lead
you straight to

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.741
the Magma field
and fry your fishies!

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:10.554
♪

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.921
(Tricky)
Hey, Nistro!

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.054
I'm calling
you out!

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.054
Who's this fool?

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:23.054
Come on, chump,
I'm talking to you!

00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:26.421
Looks like we've got
a duel on our hands!

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:30.687
It's Tricky Tommy Noble
versus the notorious Nistro!

00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:35.654
I'll make this
quick and painless.

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:37.021
Go, Grapple
Blocker!

00:04:40.754 --> 00:04:41.887
Tommy Noble!

00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.487
How that hack got
this far into

00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:45.354
the finals
I'll never know...

00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:47.921
But I do know he won't
make it any further!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.254
I play the spell
card Heroic Call!

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:52.521
And with it, I can now
summon the powerful

00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:55.054
Heroic Challenger,
War Hammer from my hand.

00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:58.654
Come on out
and join the party!

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.854
Put the squeeze
on 'em, Grapple Blocker!

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:05.221
Get your slimy mitts
off my monster!

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:09.954
Let's show him how to
land an attack, War Hammer!

00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:20.887
(Mr. Heartland)
A truly amazing victory
for former

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.621
World Duel Carnival
Committee member...

00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:24.887
Nistro!

00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:28.021
With just one move,
he beat Tricky Tommy Noble!

00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:29.054
Come on!

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:31.354
Cut to Yuma already!

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:32.587
Did you hear
Heartland?

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.754
People are
already dueling!

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.321
I better get to
a field and fast!

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:39.954
Watch where
you're going!

00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:42.287
You're heading straight
for a trap marker!

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:43.254
Look there!

00:05:47.454 --> 00:05:48.821
(groaning)

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.554
That hurt...

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.721
Trap markers
mean business.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:57.021
(Nistro)
Quinton's in my way!

00:05:57.054 --> 00:05:59.521
But he won't be
for very long!

00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:01.587
Hey, pal, what do you
say we duel?

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.554
Looks like Nistro's back!

00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:08.521
And now he's challenging
Quinton to a duel.

00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:11.721
But please, Nistro, make it
longer than your last one...

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:14.287
Am I right,
duel fans?

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:15.387
Fool.

00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:18.654
Dueling me is
a colossal mistake.

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:19.654
We'll see...

00:06:19.687 --> 00:06:21.721
War Hammer, attack
him directly!

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:25.587
Sorry, but that
won't work, Nistro.

00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:28.587
Not when I activate Malevolent
Flash from my hand.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.821
This card stops
your monster's attack,

00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:33.487
and sends that monster
back to your hand.

00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:38.321
Come on, Quinton, that was
all bark and no bite!

00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:39.687
You'll need to do
way better than

00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:42.821
that if you want
a shot at beating me.

00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:46.154
Oh come now, Nistro,
don't flatter yourself.

00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:47.721
You know you're
outmatched.

00:06:47.754 --> 00:06:51.621
I activate the
spell card Punishing Fire!

00:06:51.654 --> 00:06:55.087
And just like that, you take
600 points of damage.

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.154
Oh my goodness!

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.721
This is certainly
an explosive duel!

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:05.654
Folks, why don't we just say
goodbye to Nistro for now, huh?

00:07:05.687 --> 00:07:07.687
The match is too hot to handle.

00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:10.521
Oh...

00:07:10.554 --> 00:07:13.287
In fact, there's a new
duel shaping up right now,

00:07:13.321 --> 00:07:15.454
so let's check
in on Quattro!

00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:18.354
And now, Fiendish Knight,
finish him off!

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:24.954
(yelling)

00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:26.587
(Mr. Heartland)
And look over here!

00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:29.587
Shark's going at it with
the Sultan of Spells!

00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:32.921
End this
once and for all, Big Jaws!

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:34.321
Gulp Grind Attack!

00:07:40.787 --> 00:07:42.187
(grunting)

00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:46.054
(Quattro)
That's right, Shark.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:48.321
Stay on my tail.

00:07:48.354 --> 00:07:49.921
Follow me to
the Magma Field where

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:51.921
I'll dish out
your defeat.

00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:54.354
I bet Quattro'll turn
Shark into fish flakes!

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:56.154
Shark'll turn Quattro
into canned tuna!

00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:57.187
Oh, come on.

00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:58.754
Quattro'll hook
that fish and have him

00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:00.621
stuffed and mounted
in no time!

00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:01.887
Stop!

00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:03.887
Enough with the fish
references, you two!

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.987
You're giving me
a headache!

00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:07.521
But we're having
a whale of a time.
But we're having
a whale of a time.

00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:12.121
Yuma, the turn you
took leads us

00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:14.154
straight back to
that punching trap again.

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:16.654
(groaning)

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:19.521
Forgot...

00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.287
Oh...

00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:25.487
Did that jog
your memory?

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.187
This would be
observation number 19.

00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:30.921
Yuma is as bad a driver
as a duelist.

00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:38.811
(beeping)

00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:41.311
(Dextra)
Looks like there's
a spell marker up ahead.

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:43.711
Now this could either
prove to be very good...

00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:44.744
or very bad.

00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:48.378
Excellent.

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.511
Dian Keto, the Cure Master.

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:55.944
Due to this spell card,
I gain a thousand life points.

00:08:55.978 --> 00:08:59.278
Now my total is 7000,
but it's still not enough.

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.044
I need more life points if
I'm going to beat Vetrix!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.411
(Kite)
Hmm, he stopped...

00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:07.544
So, Vetrix...

00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:09.244
what're you
up to?

00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:11.311
Orbital, come in!

00:09:11.344 --> 00:09:12.911
<i>Yes, Master Kite!</i>

00:09:12.944 --> 00:09:14.178
Listen carefully.

00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:16.644
Analyze Vetrix's movements
on this course.

00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:18.178
And be quick about it.

00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.211
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:21.678
Vetrix...

00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:29.477
Looks like
a trap marker ahead.

00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:33.577
It is!

00:09:33.578 --> 00:09:38.911
I spy with my little eye,
the trap card Butterfly Mist.

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:41.811
I would have taken damage if
I hadn't avoided it.

00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:42.844
Lucky me.

00:09:42.878 --> 00:09:44.178
(cackling)

00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:49.678
So many trap cards,
and so few ways to avoid them.

00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:54.078
It's as if someone is planting
them to lead me somewhere.

00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:56.444
I wonder who could
be behind it all...

00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:58.444
♪

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:04.244
(Dextra)
Now I have 8,000
life points,

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:07.211
but I still need more
if I'm going to face Vetrix.

00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:09.811
Would you please try to stop
driving into traps?

00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:12.978
Now you're down
to only 200 life points!

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.478
Yeah, and only a small
handful of teeth.

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.678
It would be one thing
if you lost points dueling,

00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:19.144
but you're just not
paying attention!

00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:20.144
Sheesh.

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:22.411
Ah, you sound
just like Mr. Kay.

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:23.778
Yuma, look
up ahead...

00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:27.444
That can't
be good!

00:10:27.478 --> 00:10:29.278
Hit the brakes!

00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:30.878
(yelling)

00:10:37.278 --> 00:10:38.711
Another trap!

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:41.144
It's the trap card
the Paths of Destiny.

00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:42.378
You flip a coin.

00:10:42.411 --> 00:10:45.444
If it lands heads, you gain
2,000 life points,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.944
but if it
lands tails,

00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:48.678
you take 2,000 points
of damage.

00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:50.678
Uh-oh, not good.

00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:52.078
This is awesome!

00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.111
This'll be the easiest
2,000 life points I ever gain!

00:10:55.144 --> 00:10:56.611
But if the coin
lands on tails,

00:10:56.644 --> 00:10:58.444
you'll be totally out
of life points!

00:10:58.478 --> 00:10:59.911
C'mon, trust me, Tori,

00:10:59.944 --> 00:11:01.278
I've got a hunch
about this one...

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.778
Unlikely as
it may be,

00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:04.611
I hope Yuma knows
what he is doing.

00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:08.744
Here I go!

00:11:08.744 --> 00:11:10.944
I'm feeling
the flow!

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.744
(groaning)

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.577
I know it's a hard
fact to accept,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.977
but you are in
a duel you cannot win.

00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:22.044
Ha!

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:23.777
You're not seeing
the big picture!

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.110
My plan'll soon become clear
to you, I promise!

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.644
Is it a plan
to lose?

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.677
Please.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.777
Get real, Quinton!

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.210
Losing is your
department!

00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:34.977
Mine is beating
chumps like you.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.977
Let me show ya.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.310
I summon Heroic
Challenger,

00:11:37.344 --> 00:11:39.010
Double Lance
from my hand!

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:49.810
When I Xyz Summon,
this monster counts as two!

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:55.277
So, I overlay two
Level 4 Double Lances!

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.277
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.210
and Xyz Summon Heroic
Champion, Excalibur!

00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:14.177
Excalibur can't attack
unless I have

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.644
500 or fewer
life points, which I do.

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:19.077
And that's just
the start...

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.977
By using all
its Overlay Units,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.610
I can double
Excalibur's attack points.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.177
Now!

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.444
Go, Excalibur!

00:12:29.477 --> 00:12:31.010
Attack Quinton
directly!

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:39.344
I activate the trap card
Neverending Nightmare.

00:12:39.377 --> 00:12:41.877
This card not only
stops your monster's attack,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.477
but you also take damage equal
to half its attack points.

00:12:55.177 --> 00:12:56.810
Oh, no way!

00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:59.610
Ironic that your own monster
will deliver defeat.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.077
You will soon
be finished.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.710
(Yuma)
Not so fast there,
Quinton!

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:07.677
It's Yuma!

00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:11.377
Now use
Achacha Chanbara.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.544
Yeah!

00:13:12.577 --> 00:13:15.410
I summon Achacha Chanbara
from my hand!

00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:23.877
(Astral)
Achacha Chanbara stops
Nistro from taking damage

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.810
and Quinton takes 400 points
of damage instead!

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.677
No, my-- my
life points!

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.077
You will pay!

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.244
This I swear!

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.277
(Vetrix)
Quinton...

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.777
I would prefer
you let them go.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.344
But, Vetrix...

00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:47.377
<i>Do I need to
repeat myself?</i>

00:13:49.044 --> 00:13:50.477
<i>Well?</i>

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.610
No, I understand.

00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:01.910
Whoa, good timing,
Yuma!

00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:03.844
You really
saved me, kid!

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.377
Whaddaya say you
and me go after

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.744
that clown
and really let him have it?

00:14:07.777 --> 00:14:09.410
Nistro,
let the clown go!

00:14:09.444 --> 00:14:12.177
Why not regain some of those
life points you lost first?

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.177
Er...

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.177
'Kay, good point.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.177
Follow me!

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.144
To where?

00:14:18.877 --> 00:14:20.477
(Quinton)
Yuma Tsukumo...

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.944
What exactly is his
objective here?

00:14:22.977 --> 00:14:25.244
Victory or
friendship?

00:14:25.277 --> 00:14:28.277
(Vetrix)
<i>Yuma reminds me
of his father.</i>

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.844
Kazuma Tsukumo...

00:14:30.877 --> 00:14:33.877
Kazuma's own foolish
loyalty to his friend

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.544
ultimately led to
his undoing.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.510
(Yuma)
Here it is!

00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:41.710
This is
a trap marker.

00:14:41.744 --> 00:14:43.644
That's right,
Nistro.

00:14:43.677 --> 00:14:44.944
How am I gonna
use a trap

00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:46.944
to regain
life points, Yuma?

00:14:46.977 --> 00:14:48.244
It's a coin toss.

00:14:48.277 --> 00:14:52.244
Heads you get 2,000 life points,
tails you lose 2,000.

00:14:52.277 --> 00:14:54.610
Whoa, those are
risky odds!

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.944
Yeah, but I've got
a pretty good hunch about this.

00:14:57.977 --> 00:15:02.244
And besides, the odds
of losing are only 50%.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.244
Hmph.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:04.477
A "hunch," huh?

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.477
Not just a hunch,
a pretty good hunch!

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.177
Come on, try it!

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.477
Whaddaya have to lose,
except life points?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.577
You're crazy, kid.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.910
(Yuma)
I've got a feeling
it's gonna be

00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:17.910
smooth sailin'
from here on out.

00:15:20.244 --> 00:15:21.910
You are so wrong,
Yuma!

00:15:21.944 --> 00:15:23.277
(yelling)

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.944
(sighing)

00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:38.577
(Tori)
Yuma!

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.292
(Vetrix)
With several
duelists headed my way,

00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:47.925
this map certainly paints
a dismal picture!

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.792
My, my, my...

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.059
Three super-powerful
monsters!

00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:54.125
(laughing)

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:56.259
Any one of them alone
could eliminate

00:15:56.292 --> 00:15:58.692
even the most
expert duelist!

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:00.225
And these three
terrors are all

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.792
targeting
poor little ol' me.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:05.059
Things look bleak now,
don't they?

00:16:06.492 --> 00:16:07.759
(growling)

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:12.625
I'll just have
to beat them all.

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:15.125
I do hope I've timed
this just right.

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:17.859
One...

00:16:17.892 --> 00:16:19.359
and ah-two...

00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:20.725
and ah-three!

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:26.959
(Dextra)
He defeated three duelists
at once!

00:16:26.992 --> 00:16:29.625
Vetrix's power is
off the charts!

00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:33.192
Kite...

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:36.492
There's no way I'm gonna stand
by and let Kite duel this guy.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.692
There's so much action going
on in the Dragon's Den,

00:16:42.725 --> 00:16:43.959
it's hard
to keep track.

00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:45.792
Let's recap all
the craziness!

00:16:45.825 --> 00:16:47.525
Of our 23 original
finalists,

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:50.692
only 14 survived
the SkyScape section

00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:52.125
and now six of
them have been

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:54.825
eliminated in
the Dragon's Den!

00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:56.525
There's only
eight left!

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:59.925
All right!

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:01.225
Yuma!

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:03.459
Finally, Yuma's gettin'
some screen time!

00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:05.225
I was worried
he had lost already,

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:06.825
but in the end,
he made it!

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.359
Go, Yuma!

00:17:08.392 --> 00:17:09.759
Don't celebrate
yet, you guys,

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:11.425
those other
duelists are tough!

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:13.459
Oh stop, there's
no way he'll lose...

00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:15.959
Because Yuma's so feelin'
the flow!

00:17:15.992 --> 00:17:18.925
Up next, it's the part
everyone's been waiting for!

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.025
It's time for our
one-on-one duels!

00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:24.892
And now, without
further adieu!

00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:28.492
Let's get
set to duel!

00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:35.392
Yes...

00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:36.959
Just keep on following
me, Shark!

00:17:36.992 --> 00:17:37.959
(Yuma)
Hey, Tori.

00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:39.159
I'm thinking of
going back to

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:41.825
the coin toss trap
to get more life points!

00:17:41.859 --> 00:17:42.892
Oh, no way!

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:43.892
Don't you dare
press your luck

00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:45.359
like that again,
mister!

00:17:45.392 --> 00:17:47.825
C'mon, Tori, I'm so
feelin' the flow right now!

00:17:49.092 --> 00:17:50.059
Yuma...

00:17:50.092 --> 00:17:51.059
Orbital!

00:17:51.092 --> 00:17:52.692
Are you certain
about this?

00:17:52.725 --> 00:17:54.025
(Orbital 7)
Yes, Master Kite.

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:56.659
Vetrix's suspicious, winding
route results from

00:17:56.692 --> 00:17:58.925
his path being
blocked by trap markers.

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:00.159
Someone appears
to be leading

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:02.359
him to where they
wish him to go.

00:18:02.392 --> 00:18:03.659
Even more
curious is that all

00:18:03.692 --> 00:18:06.692
these traps have
butterfly names.

00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:08.059
No, it can't be.

00:18:14.925 --> 00:18:16.625
It's Dextra!

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:18.992
<i>I know you're after Vetrix,
but he's mine!</i>

00:18:19.025 --> 00:18:21.025
But why do you
want Vetrix?

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.292
Let's put it
this way.

00:18:22.325 --> 00:18:24.525
The sooner he's out
of the Carnival, the better.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.859
I think he's up
to no good so

00:18:25.892 --> 00:18:28.125
I'm gonna make sure
he doesn't stick around.

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:29.192
But I have to
face Vetrix!

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:30.759
For Hart!

00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:31.959
You want Vetrix?

00:18:31.992 --> 00:18:32.992
Then you're gonna
have to duel

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.759
through me
to get to him!

00:18:34.792 --> 00:18:37.192
Then you leave
me no choice!

00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:39.425
Okay, you don't
scare me, Kite!

00:18:39.459 --> 00:18:41.625
In fact, I'll even
start us off!

00:18:41.659 --> 00:18:43.259
I give up
1,000 life points...

00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:46.092
and activate the spell
Butterfly Ballet!

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.492
Now, for every
Butterfly monster in my hand,

00:18:48.525 --> 00:18:50.725
you take 300 points
of damage!

00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:56.525
How could you let
her get away?

00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.559
Please understand,
I'm trying to save you, Kite!

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:05.159
And my best bet
for doing that

00:19:05.192 --> 00:19:06.325
is getting to
the Jungle Field.

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:09.425
It should give
me an advantage.

00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:11.459
Once I get Vetrix
to duel me there,

00:19:11.492 --> 00:19:13.559
my deck will
overpower him!

00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:16.225
Who might this be?

00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:17.659
She must be
the one guiding me

00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:19.559
with those nasty
little traps.

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:23.259
If you wish to duel
me that badly, I accept.

00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:52.159
So, this is where you
want to face me?

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:55.092
It's quite pleasant
here in this Jungle Field.

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:57.225
Oh, I promise you
won't think so

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.325
after you lose
our duel, Vetrix.

00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:05.159
Enthusiasm,
I like that.

00:20:05.192 --> 00:20:08.259
But I'm going to like
crushing you so much more!

00:20:08.292 --> 00:20:10.825
(laughing)
