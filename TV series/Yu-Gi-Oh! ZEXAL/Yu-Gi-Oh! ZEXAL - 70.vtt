00:00:00.622 --> 00:00:02.622
(Yuma)
Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:05.488
(Astral)
He is going to
use Hart's power

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.921
as a trigger to fire
the Sphere Field Cannon.

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.488
(Dr. Faker)
Once Astral world is destroyed,
Barian's power will be mine!

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:18.788
And with that this entire
world will kneel before me!

00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:21.054
(Yuma)
We can do
this together!

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.654
This is it!

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.954
(Dr. Faker)
Your end begins now.

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:36.721
I'm going
to unleash a force

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:40.021
greater than anything
you've ever faced!

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.154
It is draining the
other Numbers' power.

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:44.421
I feel myself
growing weaker.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:48.888
I Xyz Summon,
Number 53, Heart-Earth!

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:52.054
Utopia!

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:54.954
Rising Sun Slash!

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.888
Shark Drake, finish
off that Heart-Earth.

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.321
Deep Sea Destruction!

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:05.288
Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon, attack!

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.921
Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:11.688
No way.

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.454
Is it over?

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:19.388
<i>(Yuma)
It looks like
Faker survived...</i>

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.254
<i>only now he's
got a new friend.</i>

00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:24.588

(maniacal laughing)

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.088
He survived.

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:39.121
(Dr. Faker)
I told you it would be
impossible to defeat

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:43.921
a genius like me--
especially now that I have this!

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:47.288
Fix your fearful eyes on
Heart-Earth's true form.

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:50.621
Number 92,
Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:53.821
He should've
lost the duel.

00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:56.988
How did he
summon a new Number?

00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.354
Your meager minds
can't fathom my tactics,

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.821
but I'll try to explain.

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:03.754
Kite thought he
had vanquished me.

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.254
But when he attacked
Heart-Earth,

00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.154
it had no
Overlay Units.

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:09.688
Therefore, I could use
Heart-Earth itself

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:14.554
as an Overlay Unit and thereby
summon Heart-Earth Dragon.

00:03:14.588 --> 00:03:16.988
Furthermore, once I've
summoned this monster,

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.654
any of your monsters
that are in attack mode

00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:22.388
are immediately switched
to defense mode.

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.588
And so, you finally see how
hopeless it was to challenge me,

00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.288
the greatest intelligence
in the universe.

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.688
You have no choice but
to accept your defeat!

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:35.088
He switched
our monsters up

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:38.321
and right before any attack
could deal him damage.

00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:40.854
This guy's got more
tricks than a magician.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.054
I wonder what else he's
got in store for us?

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:46.354
Let me show you--
get ready you three.

00:03:46.388 --> 00:03:48.521
It's the trap Fake Form.

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:51.221
Since the battle mode
of your monsters changed,

00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:53.321
you're going to lose
400 life points

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:56.754
for each monster you fools
have on your field.

00:03:56.788 --> 00:03:58.554
Each one?

00:03:58.588 --> 00:03:59.988
Oh, no!

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:01.288
Yuma...

00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:05.721
That's 1200 points, enough
to terminate this duel.

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:10.154
What do we do?

00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:13.521
I activate Kuriphoton's
special ability.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.154
I'll send this card from
my hand to the graveyard

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:19.621
and then give up half
of our life points.

00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:25.821
Now we won't take any
damage from your trap.

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.788
Kite!

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.021
Be careful, you're
wearing yourself out.

00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:36.554
Be quiet.

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:41.354
No matter what it costs me,
I'm gonna finish this.

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.788
I'll never give up
till I beat Faker.

00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:46.021
That's an
unwise choice.

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:47.221
If you had backed down,

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:50.454
you would have saved yourself
from even greater suffering!

00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:53.388
So be it, I draw!

00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:57.021
Heart-Earth Dragon, target
Shark Drake and eliminate it!

00:04:57.054 --> 00:04:58.488
What's he doing?

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:01.554
His Number has
zero attack points!

00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:03.621
(Dr. Faker)
How's this for
an ingenious plan?

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:06.488
Heart-Earth Dragon can't
be destroyed in battle,

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.554
plus any battle damage
I would take gets negated,

00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:11.588
and that damage I would
have taken impacts

00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:13.388
the three of you instead!

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.954
Say what?

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:16.721
He has us backed
into a corner.

00:05:16.754 --> 00:05:19.454
We don't have nearly enough
life points left to survive.

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:20.754
That's right.

00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:22.721
Heart-Earth
Dragon attack!

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:25.421
Go Dragon
Cannon Blast!

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.321
Guys, we're in trouble!

00:05:30.117 --> 00:05:32.350
Go Dragon Cannon Blast!

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:34.217
Guys, we're in trouble!

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.583
I'll save us!

00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:38.884
My Escape Lure trap
will deflect the attack.

00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:40.550
Good thing I had
this card handy.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.450
With it, I was able to change
the target of Faker's attack

00:05:43.483 --> 00:05:47.683
to a different monster, and the
battle damage gets cut in half!

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:51.516
Now Heart-Earth Dragon's
going after Utopia instead!

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.850
Why'd Shark put
Utopia in danger?

00:05:57.883 --> 00:05:59.983
Because if you lessen
the damage to Faker,

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:02.316
you lessen
the damage to us.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.816
Hey, that's right.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.316
I'm gonna activate
my trap Half Unbreak!

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.150
This card will reduce
any battle damage by half.

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:14.416
I'll use its effect on
Dr. Faker's Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.350
Why would he use
a trap on my monster

00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:20.250
instead of
protecting his own?

00:06:20.283 --> 00:06:22.016
(Yuma)
Can't you figure
it out, genius?

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.683
By decreasing
the damage to you,

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:26.650
less damage gets deflected
back to me and my friends!

00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:28.850
To be more precise,
your attack on Utopia

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:33.383
only results in 500 points of
damage to Heart-Earth Dragon.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:35.983
So we'll only take
500 points of damage.

00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:39.150
Is that clear enough or
are you still confused?

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.683
(Dr. Faker)
Clever, I'll admit,
but also pointless.

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:03.283
I will now
activate another one

00:07:03.316 --> 00:07:07.116
of Heart-Earth Dragon's
special abilities.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.116
All the damage that
I took in this battle

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.083
will be instantly
wiped out

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:14.350
and my life points are
restored by that amount.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.016
I place a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.383
It's your move.

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:22.916
Aw, great, we've only got
a hundred life points left.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.016
That's almost nothing.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.683
(Shark)
But it isn't nothing.

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:29.416
Sounds to me like you're
ready to call it quits, Yuma.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.350
What?

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:33.383
I've never
given up before.

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:35.483
And I'm not
about to start now!

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:38.983
Astral is counting on me
to save him from Faker.

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:41.116
And I'm not gonna
let Astral down.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.250
Time to high
five the sky!

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.683
I'm pullin' out all
the stops, Faker!

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:51.183
Are you
with me, Utopia?

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:54.350
Go Chaos
Xyz Evolution!

00:07:57.716 --> 00:08:02.316
Make way for Chaos
Number 39: Utopia Ray!

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.550
(Dr. Faker)
A Chaos Number!

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.950
That's a powerful
adversary indeed.

00:08:18.983 --> 00:08:20.983
But it still isn't
strong enough to overcome

00:08:21.016 --> 00:08:24.216
the special abilities of
my Heart-Earth Dragon!

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.516
<i>His Number seems totally
unstoppable especially since</i>

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.216
<i>it's got a gazillion-an'-one
special abilities!</i>

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.450
<i>But even so, there's gotta be
a way to turn this duel around.</i>

00:08:33.483 --> 00:08:34.750
<i>But how?</i>

00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:37.350
<i>C'mon think...</i>

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.683
<i>Ah, of course!</i>

00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:42.116
Go get 'em,
Utopia Ray!

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.016
Rising Sun
Chaos Slash!

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.650
Congratulations, boy!

00:08:47.683 --> 00:08:51.083
You've just sealed your own
team's complete destruction!

00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:52.316
That would be true,

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.416
except I'm activating
this card from my hand!

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.116
It's the spell
Gamusharush!

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.650
This shrinks my monster's
attack points to zero

00:09:00.683 --> 00:09:04.850
but then you get bashed
with 600 points of damage.

00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:18.250
That worked out exactly
like I planned.

00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:20.716
My turn is done.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.850
You tried some actual
strategy for a change.

00:09:23.883 --> 00:09:27.050
Since attacks can't damage
him, you found another way.

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.850
It was only 600 points,
but that's not bad.

00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:31.383
We can get
this done.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.216
The important thing is to keep
working together as a team.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.816
It's up to
you now, Shark.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.016
I can handle
it from here!

00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:44.183
<i>Gotta tough it out.</i>

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.750
I'm activating
yet another

00:09:45.783 --> 00:09:50.450
of Heart-Earth Dragon's
special abilities!

00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:54.083
If you summon a monster or put
a card facedown on your field,

00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:56.516
those cards are banished
on the next turn!

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.716
Banished?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.850
That's right!

00:09:58.883 --> 00:10:01.283
Say good-bye
to Utopia Ray!

00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:07.616
He's trying to mess
up our teamwork.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.350
(laughing)

00:10:09.383 --> 00:10:10.783
You must be joking!

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:13.716
You actually think you three
are working as a team?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.516
You're too different
from each other.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.483
Face it, the bond between you
simply isn't strong enough!

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:24.216
Sorry, but you couldn't be more
wrong if you tried, Faker.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.350
We do have something
important that connects us.

00:10:26.383 --> 00:10:28.583
It's the
goal we share.

00:10:28.616 --> 00:10:30.183
We all wanna
take you down!

00:10:30.216 --> 00:10:31.783
And it's gonna happen!

00:10:31.816 --> 00:10:34.216
That's right, Shark.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.316
Shark Drake,
let's do this!

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.616
Go Chaos
Xyz Evolution!

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.416
Come on out.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.416
Chaos Number 32:
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:05.750
Next, I'll activate my spell
card, Deep Sea Attack!

00:11:05.783 --> 00:11:08.516
By sending Jawsman in my
hand to the graveyard,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.516
my monster can
attack you directly!

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:21.583
Shark Drake Veiss, attack
Dr. Faker with Chaos Stream!

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:26.816
He's steering clear
of Heart-Earth Dragon

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.783
to finish off Faker.

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:34.716
You got him, Shark!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.350
Not so fast.

00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:38.416
I'm afraid I'll have
to disappoint you

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.683
by activating my
trap Fake Life.

00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:45.116
And now, watch and weep
as I take no damage

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.350
from Shark's
pointless attack

00:11:47.383 --> 00:11:50.916
but instead, boost my life
points by the same amount!

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.350
Every time we
think we got him down,

00:11:52.383 --> 00:11:54.950
he bounces back up.

00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:58.316
I'll put a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.816
Shark!

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.116
We've gotta
get you some help!

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.750
Not till we
win this duel.

00:12:05.783 --> 00:12:06.883
(Yuma)
But...

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:09.283
(Kite)
Listen Shark...

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:11.150
Don't worry, I've
got it from here.

00:12:11.183 --> 00:12:13.916
I'll follow your lead and
crush Faker for good.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.150
Here goes.

00:12:15.183 --> 00:12:17.650
I draw!

00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:19.450
You three will
never learn.

00:12:19.483 --> 00:12:21.650
Once again,
I activate

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:24.950
Heart-Earth Dragon's
special ability!

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.083
Sorry, but you'll have to say
goodbye to Shark Drake Veiss!

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.583
As you can see,
your "team"

00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:40.383
is in a totally
desperate situation!

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.933
As you can see,
your "team"

00:12:48.966 --> 00:12:51.766
is in a totally
desperate situation!

00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:06.033
I was waiting for you
to do that, Dr. Faker.

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:09.433
This is a desperate
situation, but for you.

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:10.966
What do you mean?

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.333
I activate a trap!

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:14.899
It's called
Xyz Dimension Splash!

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:16.833
This trap activates
when it's banished,

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.699
so thanks
Heart-Earth Dragon.

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:20.266
Because of that,
I can summon two

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.333
Level 8 Water Attribute
monsters from my deck!

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:26.299
But I was so close
to achieving victory!

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:28.899
I'm summoning two
of my Hyper-Ancient

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.099
Shark Megalodons!

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:40.066
So you turned
Heart-Earth Dragon's

00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:42.199
special ability
to your advantage.

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:44.066
Now Kite's taking
over and will finish

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:45.466
what I've started.

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:50.266
Because... the three of us
can work together as a team.

00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:52.799
Shark!

00:13:58.199 --> 00:13:59.899
All set!

00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:05.066
I overlay Galaxy-Eyes and
Shark's Two Hyper Megalodons!

00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:09.533
With these three monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:14:09.566 --> 00:14:14.733
I Xyz Summon Neo
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:34.133
Cool, now we're
back in business!

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.199
I've almost exceeded
the limit of my power

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:42.566
but I have to hang on.

00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:45.966
I must find the
strength... within me.

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:51.433
Neo Galaxy-Eyes'
special ability activates!

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:52.933
It gets rid of the
special abilities

00:14:52.966 --> 00:14:55.766
of all the other
monsters on the field!

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:58.066
Photon Howling!

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:02.833
Heart-Earth!

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:06.299
Your Numbers special abilities
are no more, Doctor.

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:07.999
And by using
one Overlay Unit,

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:13.399
Neo Galaxy-Eyes can absorb all
your Numbers Overlay Units.

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:17.533
Oh, and here's something else
that might interest you:

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:20.233
Neo Galaxy-Eyes gains
500 attack points

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:23.199
for every Overlay Unit
that it absorbed.

00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:26.133
5,000 points,
it can't be!

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.166
Now then, Faker, are you
gonna come to your senses

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:30.666
and give up your
insane schemes?

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:33.833
Or will I have to force
you to change your ways?

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.799
How dare you threaten the
universe's greatest genius!

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:39.266
Guess I will
have to use force.

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.533
Neo Galaxy-Eyes,
attack with

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.733
Ultimate Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:07.066
Awesome, that sure
cut Faker down to size.

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:11.899
I'll give you
one last chance.

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:14.299
Set Hart free now.

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.799
I won't ask again.

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.333
Release him!

00:16:19.599 --> 00:16:22.233
Don't you see...
I can't.

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:23.799
You think you're
helping Hart

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:26.633
but you're only putting
him in greater danger.

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:29.166
How is that?

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:31.166
Because your brother
cannot hope to survive

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:34.233
unless Astral World is
destroyed once and for all!

00:16:42.927 --> 00:16:47.127
Why would you have to destroy
Astral World to save Hart?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.827
It makes sense
once you see

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.760
that Hart's life depends
on Barian World's power.

00:16:51.794 --> 00:16:53.627
Barian World?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.960
Ever since his birth,

00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:57.627
Hart's physical
condition was frail.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.460
I knew it would grow
worse over time

00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:01.294
unless something
drastic was done.

00:17:01.327 --> 00:17:02.660
In my quest
to save the boy,

00:17:02.694 --> 00:17:05.760
I decided I had to look outside
our world for a solution.

00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:07.294
Once I had
decided that

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:08.794
I would save Hart
no matter what,

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:11.460
I abandoned
everything else.

00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:14.160
Even my own principles.

00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:17.227
Although I greatly
respected Byron and Kazuma,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.960
I nevertheless
betrayed them

00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:22.360
in order to open the
portal we discovered.

00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:25.894
As I hoped, the portal did
open to another world.

00:17:25.927 --> 00:17:28.494
I soon discovered it
was called Barian.

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:31.260
It was a strange world
with energy resources

00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:33.027
that seemed
to be unique.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.827
Because of this,
the inhabitants

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.427
possessed knowledge and
technologies radically

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.360
different
from our own.

00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:41.527
I did not hesitate to
make a deal with them.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.394
They promised me that
they would save Hart

00:17:43.427 --> 00:17:47.994
and in exchange, I agreed
to destroy Astral World.

00:17:48.027 --> 00:17:49.960
My plan
slowly took shape.

00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:51.794
It would require
great force,

00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:53.994
but by harnessing the
power of the Numbers,

00:17:54.027 --> 00:17:56.194
I could use my
Sphere Field Cannon

00:17:56.227 --> 00:17:59.660
to target Astral World
and obliterate it.

00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:01.560
Failure is
not an option.

00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:04.160
I was told that if my
mission does not succeed,

00:18:04.194 --> 00:18:06.960
Hart would
be taken away.

00:18:06.994 --> 00:18:09.794
Why didn't you tell me
all this before?

00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:11.160
I couldn't risk it.

00:18:11.194 --> 00:18:13.360
I was afraid that if you
learned the truth,

00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:14.860
you might
try something rash

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:17.427
that could
increase the danger.

00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:20.860
I will always be
grateful to you, Kite.

00:18:20.894 --> 00:18:23.360
I asked much of you,
especially when I needed

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:26.227
you to become a Number Hunter
to help your brother.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.560
Even then you
did not defy me.

00:18:28.594 --> 00:18:30.794
I wish I could have told
you the whole truth about

00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:34.427
why I was driven to such
extremes, but then...

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.660
That was wrong
of you, Father.

00:18:38.694 --> 00:18:41.394
(Kite)
You put your trust in
Barian without question

00:18:41.427 --> 00:18:44.527
yet you couldn't find it in
yourself to trust me...

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.027
...your own son!

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.794
My son!

00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:53.327
I've sworn to protect Hart and
I intend to keep that promise.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.960
But I'll do it
the right way.

00:18:54.994 --> 00:18:57.394
And that's by stopping
Barian World!

00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:02.427
Kite, you won't be
fighting alone.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.394
I don't know
a lot about Barian,

00:19:04.427 --> 00:19:06.894
but I'll be battling
at your side!

00:19:06.927 --> 00:19:08.394
(Shark)
And so will I.

00:19:08.427 --> 00:19:09.394
Shark?

00:19:09.427 --> 00:19:10.760
Don't get
the wrong idea.

00:19:10.794 --> 00:19:15.760
Barian has to be stopped and
I wanna be in on the action.

00:19:15.794 --> 00:19:18.060
(Yuma)
We'll join all of
our powers together.

00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:19.894
Just like we
did today, guys!

00:19:19.927 --> 00:19:22.827
We can't lose!

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.194
Father, you don't have to
carry this burden anymore.

00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:28.894
We'll settle everything,
I promise.

00:19:28.927 --> 00:19:30.194
I know what I'm doing.

00:19:30.227 --> 00:19:32.627
Please trust me.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.994
Yes, Kite.

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:35.360
(Barian)
Dr. Faker!

00:19:38.827 --> 00:19:40.327
(Barian)
You almost succeeded.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.427
But at the critical
moment, you faltered!

00:19:45.027 --> 00:19:46.494
Wait, what's wrong?

00:19:46.527 --> 00:19:50.427
No, no, stay away!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.527
What's happening
to you, Father?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.260
(Barian)
Since you failed me, I will
have to complete what you began.

00:20:06.294 --> 00:20:09.327
(roaring)

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.860
What's happening?

00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:21.194
(Barian)
You three believe
you can defeat me?

00:20:21.227 --> 00:20:23.960
Then I will give you
the chance to prove it.

00:20:23.994 --> 00:20:26.594
This duel
is far from over.

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:28.827
What do you mean--
who are you?

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.427
I am from Barian World!

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.060
(maniacal laughing)
