WEBVTT

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.760
Students: I have
so much homework!

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.190
Do we have band
practice today?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.590
Tori: Yuma, c'mon... Wake up!

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.390
There was a unicorn in the...

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.560
hey!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.930
Ow!

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.560
What is your problem?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.790
Class is over.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.060
Just thought you should know.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.330
Oh.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.630
So it is.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.190
You're hopeless.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.290
All right,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.760
time to find someone to duel!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.860
I assume you were
out cold while Mr. Kay

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.190
was making the announcement
about tomorrow's class.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.660
Tomorrow's saturday?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.160
Where have you been, yuma?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.230
Tomorrow is school spirit day.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.690
Bronk: Hey Tori, which one of
your parents are you draggin'

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.430
here tomorrow, cause
I was thinkin'...

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.590
Sorry about that, yuma.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.390
Don't worry about it,
I mean... whatever...

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.730
No need to be
awkward around me.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.930
I wish I could just skip
out on school spirit day.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.030
Al: Spirit day sounds like
it involves phantoms and ghosts.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.760
It's when our parents come to
class and watch Our teachers

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.560
teach and see how
we're doing and stuff.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.260
But your parents are
not around right now.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.590
Yeah, but it can be any
member of the family.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.490
I'll get grandma
or Kari to go.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.330
I'm home, people.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.860
Uuhhhh... Hello?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.330
Grandma... you in here?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.030
Grandma: I didn't
hear you come in.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460
Yeah, figured.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730
So, what do you think
of this kimono yuma?

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.960
My fifty-Seventh high
school Reunion is tomorrow.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.730
I was thinking of
wearing this old thing.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.360
Wait, it's tomorrow?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.260
I wonder how old Henry
miyazaki is doing?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.460
He was my first
boyfriend you know,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.790
such a little
sweetie, he he he.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.060
Hey, Kari.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.630
Kari: You're not getting
your allowance in advance,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.860
so don't ask.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.130
I wasn't gonna!

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.330
Then what do you want?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.460
Case Ya' can't tell,
I'm kinda busy here.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.390
[phone ringing]

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.860
what's up, you!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.030
Really?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.690
Whoa, go back a sec, apple's
wedding is this saturday,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.890
why did I think it was...

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.290
well yeah, I'm totally going, I
wouldn't miss that for anything,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.190
I mean, have you seen the...

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.490
uhhh... yuma?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.160
Mom, dad, I miss you guys...
I wish you were here...

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.190
I hope you're safe, wherever
you are... Goodnight.

Friend a: Tori!

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.060
Hey!

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.130
Friend B: What's up?

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.190
So are both of your
parents coming to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.430
school spirit day today?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.730
My dad had to work.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.790
I really hope my dad
doesn't embarrass me.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.890
Whenever he meets my friends, he
talks in This goofy duck voice

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.290
that he thinks is
hysterical or something.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.490
And it's really not!

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.730
I heard we're doing p.E. Today.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.290
The vaulting boxes.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.690
Yeah, we are.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.860
I wonder how many boxes Yuma
will go for this time!

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.560
I wonder how hard
he'll wipe out.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.730
Uuuunh late again, late again!

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.190
Ow!

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.130
Try watching we're
you're going, dweeb.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.760
Why are you wearing
a guy's neck tie?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.790
You don't know anything
about fashion, do you?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.160
Well I do!

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.130
And I think you look good
enough to be in one

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.860
of those fashion magazines.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.060
So do you!

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.390
That kimono is amazing!

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.590
You think so?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.590
I haven't worn this thing
since I was a young ballerina.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.260
Hey, wait a sec.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.360
Shoudn't you be
upstairs sleeping still?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.530
Eeh...

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.660
I'm going to school.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.830
On a saturday?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.730
Don't tell me
you got detention.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.090
I'm not in trouble!

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.090
Gotta go!

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.930
Yuma!

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.490
Yuma, why did you decide to not

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.830
tell your family about
school spirit day?

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.560
I dunno, what would
be the point?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.230
They had things to do.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.060
I really didn't feel
like bothering them.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.860
Are they not supposed to go?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.090
Nah!

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.360
It's really no big deal.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.290
They went last year.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.990
All right, I can still
make it in time!

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.090
I am feelin' the...

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.190
oh, no!

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.390
No!

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.090
No, no!

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.160
What is wrong?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.330
It's gone!

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.360
My key is gone!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.430
What?

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.430
Where is it?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.030
Do you really believe it
simply fell from your neck?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.360
We are going to have to
retrace your steps exactly.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.630
Yuma, this is very
important to me.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.760
It's pretty important
to me too, ya know.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.330
I didn't just find
that thing lyin' around,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.360
my dad gave it to me.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.590
his father gave him the key?

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.130
what could this mean?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.160
could yuma's father
have some connection

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.630
to me and my purpose here?

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.060
this is most intriguing...

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.160
Yuma...

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.460
can you tell me
about your father?

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.790
Whaddaya wanna know?

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.430
What kind of person is he?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.860
He's the fun
kind of person.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.660
He hates sitting around,
he loves adventure.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.630
In fact, this one time,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.360
he took me along with him
on one of his expeditions.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.990
Kazuma: What's wrong, yuma?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.390
You didn't look
down now, did you?

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.790
Young yuma: I can't do it!

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.330
I can't go any further!

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.830
Whaddaya saying,
we're almost there!

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.990
But I'm, I'm scared...

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.390
young KARI: Aaargh!

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.890
This is totally unfair!

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.630
How come yuma got to go climbing
with dad and I didn't?

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.130
Are you saying
you don't want to

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.290
help me prune my award
winning chrysanthemums today?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.060
Yeah, grandma.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.760
It's just not fair!

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.790
Oh Well, it must be really
nice being the favorite.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.630
Mira: Don't be so dramatic.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.090
Your father just wanted to
spend some time with yuma.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.330
I have an idea.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.760
Why don't we go and treat
ourselves to a big fancy dinner?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.830
Okay, now we're talking!

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.590
Oh, let's get italian!

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.790
Breadsticks!

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.060
Ooh ooh, and maybe
a movie afterwards?

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.260
Either way, let's go!

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.690
You might want to put
your shoes on first...

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.130
hey pal, I got a
question for ya.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.890
What is it?

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.490
Everything ok?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.590
Your mom tells me something
happened at school last week...

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.690
upper class boy A:
Haha! You lose.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.990
Upper class boy B:
Just give up dueling.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.390
You'll never be any good.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.560
No way!

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.330
Cause one day, I'm gonna
be an awesome duelist.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.490
Yeah, of course
you are... not!

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.990
I'm gonna be great!

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.960
Just wait and see!

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.360
It was nothing.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.530
No biggie.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.630
Uh-Huh...

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.930
But, like dad?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.360
What, yuma?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.160
I just don't wanna
go to school anymore.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.260
Why not?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.060
Because, it's
just... too hard.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.760
Yuma, we live in
a complicated world.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.660
What are you talking about?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.890
Well for starters, the world
we know isn't the only world.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.260
There are actually multiple
worlds all connected.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.960
Let me show you.
So over here,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.160
we have a world full of
adventure and possibility.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.730
But then over here, we have
a world full of negativity,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.330
people saying "No" all the time.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.060
What's crazy is that these
worlds exist in the same place.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.160
Huh?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.190
Seriously?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.490
You bet.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.230
The people who live in This
world inhabit the same time and

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.730
space as the people who live
in This world over here.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.890
Take those kids at
school for instance.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.330
Sounds like they live
in the negative world.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.460
You on the other hand, you live
in the world of possibility,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.990
where people dare to dream.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.230
I do!

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.530
So how can I stay
in This world forever?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.730
That's an easy one,
little rascal!

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.360
You keep looking
to the future

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.590
and dreaming big and
setting goals for yourself!

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.130
What kind of goals?

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.330
Any kind!

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.530
You just have to
listen to your heart

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.860
and feel the flow of
everything surrounding you!

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.590
You decide who you want to be,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.160
and then you go out and
you be that person!

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.360
Don't you have
any dreams, yuma?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.530
Who, me?

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.790
Well Yeah, I wanna...

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.430
my dream is to one day become
a world champion duelist!

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.130
But like, when
I tell people that,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.730
they laugh and
make fun of me.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.130
Because those people
don't live in our world.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.630
They don't?

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.290
They're trapped
in the other world,

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.490
the world full of
doubt and negativity.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.060
It's nearly
impossible for people

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.890
stuck in that world to dream.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.590
To imagine the endless
possibilities.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.630
Those people can
only see what is.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.730
But what they cannot
see is what could be.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.060
They're not adventurers
like you and me.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.690
Yuma, always
challenge yourself.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.660
Don't be afraid to do what
others tell you you can't do.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.930
All right!

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.060
Whaddaya say?

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.160
Are you up for a little duel?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.290
Here?

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.430
Right now?

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.560
Sure!

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.630
It's gonna be great!

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.760
And then tomorrow,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.130
you and I'll climb even higher!

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.830
My dad's the best.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.290
When I told him I wanted
to be a duel champion,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.160
he was like, "go for it!"

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.390
that's one of the reasons I
never give up, I mean, he taught

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.490
me so much that calling it quits
would be like betraying him.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.930
We used to have
the best duels...

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.490
attack!

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.590
Zubaba KNIGHT: Zubaba!

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.730
Alright, here goes!

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.560
I overlay my level 4 gogogo
golem and ganbara Knight!

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.490
With These two monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.630
I xyz summon... oh!

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.060
I forgot, I don't have any xyz
monsters in this deck!

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.160
You forgot?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.960
Hey Dad?

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.190
Yeah?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.630
What's your dream?

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.960
Oh Well, um...

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.960
mine is a simple one.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.230
To journey!

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.430
To discover the
edge of the world!

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.660
What are you laughing at?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.290
You wanna go to the
edge of the world?

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.960
That's just goofy, dad!

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.160
Everyone knows
the world is round!

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.530
It doesn't have any edges.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.130
Well I guess you do
have a point there.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.790
You would just
fall right off.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.190
We were cracking up,
but maybe I had it all wrong.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.630
What do you mean
"had it all wrong?"

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.160
a little while later, he
and mom were on an expedition...

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.060
they had gotten lost
in a snow storm,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.430
separated from their team.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.330
What was that, Mira?

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.890
The ground's shaking!

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.030
Kazuma!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.060
I've got you!

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.630
Hang on, I can
pull you up!

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.430
Kazuma!

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.090
Mira...

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.230
kazuma,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.490
don't do it!

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.790
You can't pull me up!

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.930
You'll fall in with me!

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.690
Don't worry Mira,
I'm gonna be fine!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.530
Trust me, I'm in
really good hands.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.930
No!

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.160
Kazuma, no!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.560
It's like he experienced
something in that light and

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.660
like, he knew that
he was going to be okay.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.390
What is this place?

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.230
That light...

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.530
is this the edge of the world?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.660
A search team found my dad a

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.590
couple days later.
He was holding the key.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.760
Daddy!

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.160
You okay!

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.760
Hey there yuma,
you been a good boy?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.530
We've been so worried, dad.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.090
You've been missing for days!

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.860
He said he traveled to
the edge of the world.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.630
How is that possible?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.260
I have no idea.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.830
Did he say anything else?

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.790
Nothing that made much sense.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.460
He was going on about lights
and different worlds.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.130
The doctors said it was just
dehydration and exhaustion

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.530
talking. I have no idea.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.060
yuma's father found the
key on that journey.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.390
perhaps it unlocks a
door of some sort,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.290
a door connecting this
world to another one.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.130
Uh, oh yeah!

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.490
I remember when
he gave it to me.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.290
Next I activate my
soul of fire spell card!

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.930
That pretty much does it.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.360
Maybe take some PIANO
lessons or something.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.860
This duel isn't over
yet, ya got that?

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.460
So then beat me,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.190
since you're such
a great duelist.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.730
Upper Class BOY C:
Show us your greatness!

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.090
You can't defeat him,
and you know it.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.660
You couldn't defeat a donkey!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.790
You're right, I can't win.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.790
Don't give up, yuma!

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.260
Dad!

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.360
Remember What
world you're in!

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.090
What do you mean?

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.560
You live in the world where
anything is possible,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.260
just feel the flow!

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.960
It's all around you!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.760
Yuma, let that key always remind
you that you have the power to

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.490
unlock your potential and
be who you wanna be!

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.830
I can do this.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.260
Thanks, dad!

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.430
I'm never gonna give up!

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.330
I am feelin' the flow!

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.190
Mom and dad went
missing after that,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.290
and no one's heard
from them since.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.930
Caswell: Look at Tori's mom!

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.290
FLIP: She's like an Angel.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.190
Bronk's mother:
Why was 6 afraid of seven?

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.990
Because 7 ate 9.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.460
Tori's mother: Hey,
how come your friend

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.160
yuma isn't here, Tori?

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.060
I dunno.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.890
Okay uh, now I feel dumb.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.790
So then, it has been hanging
here the whole time.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.330
It must've fallen off in my
sleep and when I woke up late,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.460
I didn't notice.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.890
At least mom and dad
were watching over it.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.060
How is your garden, Meredith?

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.530
Meredith: My chrysanthemums
are blooming wonderfully!

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.990
Oh, how nice!

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.030
And I've registered my
primrose bushes to be

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.660
judged in the
annual garden fest.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.690
Now didn't your
lovely begonias

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.960
take home the blue
ribbon last year?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.430
It was my gladioli, actually.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.830
Old man: Nobody's allowed
to call me "Gramps",

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.430
"My whipper snapper,
not even my grandkids!"

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.930
maybe a duel would
put you in your place!

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.290
You should really
come over some time.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.760
I recently acquired
This lovely New tea set.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.090
Waiter: Sorry!

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.530
Do you hear something?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.330
Perhaps there's
a parade outside.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.090
Speaking of which, are you
going to the may parade?

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.360
Let's duel!

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.460
Bring it!

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.660
Of course!

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.890
I never miss the may parade!

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.430
The kids' floats last year
were quite precious!

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.460
I helped build one of them!

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.690
Together: Where has our
waiter wandered off to?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.860
Brianna: Look at you, Kari!

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.060
You look great!

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.060
Well, I never get the chance
to dress up so, you know.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.490
My idea of dressing up is to
throw on one of bronk's hats!

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.260
Sounds like you're busy.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.390
Yeah, well that's the life
of a freelance journalist.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.830
So I guess your grandma went
to the school today, then.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.060
You know, school
spirit day or whatever.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.760
Bronk dragged
mom, I think.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.160
'hey Kari...'

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.630
'case you can't tell,
I'm kinda busy here.'

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.790
aw, man.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.960
What's wrong?

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.590
Sorry, I gotta
get my grandma!

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.490
Call me!

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.490
Yuma...

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.360
Kari...

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.460
Why are you looking all
serious all of a sudden, dad?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.060
You need to keep an eye
on yuma's dueling.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:55.290
Before too long, he'll be
forced to take great risks.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.590
What kind of risks?

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.060
You'll know soon.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.330
Why do I always have to
be the responsible one?

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.530
We need you to look out for
your little brother, Kari.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.660
Where will you be?

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.960
This is very
important, Kari.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.360
Yuma is going to face
a lot of challenges,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.460
he's got quite a
road ahead of him.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.460
We need you to always
be there for him

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.790
and to support him
along the way.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.830
Okay, whatever.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.360
But I want a bigger allowance.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.160
Mr. Kay: So nice of
you to join us, yuma!

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.990
Yeah, umm Yeah.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.490
You remember where
you sit, right?

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.760
Yeah Yeah uh, sorry...

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.360
alright, are you two ready?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.630
Together: Yup!

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.830
In the end, you
can do it, Caswell!

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.730
You knock 'em dead, Tori.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.060
Ok.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.760
New school record,
here I come!

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.630
So uh, guess no one from
yuma's family could make it.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.160
Andy and Sharon, you're up!

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.530
We're ready!

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:12.960
Guess not.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.390
Yuma!

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.790
Yuma!

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.260
What are you guys doing here?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.890
We're supposed to be here,
but you didn't tell us!

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.090
For real!

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.360
Did you seriously think that
we'd be okay with missing out on

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.990
your school spirit day?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.490
You guys...
you came.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.830
Go, yuma!

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.030
Show'em what
you can do!

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.430
Tear it up!

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.060
All right!

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.230
I'm goin' for
twenty boxes today!

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.130
What are you
smiling at, yuma?

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:59.260
They're watching me.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.790
Mom and dad.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.030
I understand.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.590
I feel like I can
see them, as well.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.330
High five the sky!

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.760
Go, yuma!

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.330
Do you think he
can actually do this?

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.590
Not a chance.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.630
C'mon, yuma!

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.030
Make us proud!

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:24.360
Observation number #14 - The
people who know yuma love yuma.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.490
All right!

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.530
Do it!

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.530
Heh!

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.190
I am feelin' the flow!
