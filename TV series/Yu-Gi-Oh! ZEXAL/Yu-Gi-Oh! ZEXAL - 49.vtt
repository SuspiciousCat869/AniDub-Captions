WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.830
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.390
YUMA: Hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long!

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.990
Trey: You'll wish
you never came here at all

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.290
once you see the new
power that I've acquired.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.960
Meeting your family and seeing
you together made me think...

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990
About my own family.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.760
I want to see them all
happy like they used to be.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
But I can't help them as long
as you're standing in my way!

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.660
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.060
What's wrong?

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.690
I'm just trying my new Power on
for size, so I can destroy you!

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.390
You're through!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.890
It's done.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.260
I've separated yuma
and astral for good.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.930
Astral will always be
a part of me no matter what!

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290
Nothing you can do to
me will change that.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.330
Now, let's finish our duel.
With these two monsters,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.460
I build the overlay
network and xyz summon!

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.490
Number 6: Chronomaly atlandis!

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.930
Atlandis Can equip itself with
a number card from my graveyard

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.560
and gain its attack points!

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.660
You're equipping
it with machu mech?

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.360
That's right!

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.060
By Using one overlay
unit, atlandis wipes out

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
half your life points!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.290
Orichalcum gate!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.090
TORI: Yuma!

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.730

I knew you would never
survive without astral.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.790
Don't count me out yet...

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.990
I'm still in this,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.060
and I've got lots of fight left.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.190
That was just the warm up,
the real duel's starting now!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.190
You're down to
200 puny points.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.290
One more attack
and it's all over.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.460
It's your turn but
you may as well give up.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.090
Quitting isn't my style.
I still have a chance to pull

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.830
this off, 'cause astral's
memory is always with me.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.390
&amp;Nbspyou have my promise, astral.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.390
&amp;Nbspi may be down, but I've still
&amp;nbspgot plenty of fight left!

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.130
&amp;Nbspi'm gonna unleash the power
&amp;nbspof the card you left for me

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.990
&amp;nbspto pull off the win!

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.630
C'mon, utopia!

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.290
It's time to feel the flow!

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.760
When my life points are less
than a thousand, I can use

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.460
utopia to xyz summon
CHAOSNUMBER 39: Utopia ray!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.930
Go Chaos xyz evolution!

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.930
BRONK: Lookin' good, utopia ray!

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.330
Cathy: That's it, yuma!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.630
Great move!

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.760
At last he summoned it.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.930
&amp;Nbspthis better work!

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.030
&amp;Nbspif Utopia ray can't bring
&amp;nbsptrey back to his senses,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.760
&amp;nbspthen nothing will!

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.390
I activate overlay eater's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.490
special ability
from my graveyard!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.060
By Banishing this card,
my utopia Ray takes an

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.530
OVERLAY unit from
your xyz monster.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.330
Perfect!

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.360
Atlandis can't use its
special ability anymore.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.830
And now...

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.060
Utopia ray will use
Its special ability!

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.960
Utopia Ray gains
500 attack points

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.660
for every overlay
unit that it uses.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.430
And I'm gonna use all
three of its overlay

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.860
units to supercharge its power!

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.830
Overlay charge!

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.690
This ability also
cuts atlandis's attack

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.330
points down by 3000!

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.860
How can you duel this
way with astral gone?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.260
Because astral never left!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.560
He's always with
me, here in my heart!

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.990
You tried to take astral
away from me, but you failed!

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.430
And now we're gonna win This
duel together... Just watch!

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.930
Okay utopia ray,
it's time to strike!

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.560
Sorry But utopia
ray just struck out!

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.190
I activate my
thunder Pot trap card!

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.560
Not only does it stop
utopia ray's attack

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.830
against my atlandis, but
it also ends this battle!

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.860
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind!

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.590
I thought yuma had him!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.460
That Trey Sure is tricky!

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.630
You gave it your best try... But
even utopia ray can't stop me.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.860
Doesn't matter!

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.730
I managed to hang
on This long...

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.260
and I will find a way to win
this thing, so take your turn!

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.530
You do know how to
talk a good game, yuma.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.390
But the fact is, both
our monster's attack

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.260
points return to normal now...

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.690
So you can't possibly
survive another blow.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.390
Now, I draw...

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.390
no! Not now!

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.260
Vetrix warned me
this might happen...

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.730
VETRIX: You must understand
by acquiring the crest you will

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.890
gain the incredible power to
utilize and control number 6:

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.760
Chronomaly atlandis.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.590
However, there is a price
to be paid for this power.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.190
The crest can be dangerous.
It will drain away all

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.730
your physical and mental energy.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.460
I don't care about that.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.960
I...

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.860
just want to beat yuma...

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.290
and make you proud of me.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.830
I'm confident you
won't let me down.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.860
You're stronger
than you know, Trey.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.460
&amp;Nbspthis weakness is the
&amp;nbspprice I have to pay.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.330
&amp;Nbspvetrix believes in me and I'm
&amp;nbspnot going to let him down now!

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.260
&amp;Nbspi will not fail.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.860
You're finished yuma!

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.530
Since atlandis has
no overlay units,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.890
you lose half your
life points, yuma!

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.190
And so do I.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.530
No!

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.790
Unbelievable!

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.060
He gave up life
points just to get yuma.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.690
Flip: Please get up!

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.090
I still have a
hundred life points, Trey.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.090
That's enough to keep dueling!

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.930
The crest... it's taken over!

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.860
That crest's gonna destroy him.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.630
Trey!

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.360
No! Stay back!

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.860
I don't want your help, yuma.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.190
I chose to take this
path, understand?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.330
It's the only way I can
get the power that I need.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.360
What happens to me... it doesn't
matter at all... as long as...

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.230
I can serve my family!

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.360
But Trey...

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.030
This last attack will
wipe out your life points!

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.390
Erupt, chronomaly atlandis!

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.960
Destroy utopia ray
with celestial strike!

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.860
CASWELL: Oh, no!

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.090
If yuma takes this
hit, this duel's over!

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.730
I activate my battle
Break trap card!

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.260
When your monster attacks,
your monster is destroyed,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.290
and the battle is over!

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.430
I'll use...

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.890
the ritual was a success, Trey.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.630
Now, as promised,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.090
here's the number... along
with a most sinister card.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.560
Final prophecy?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.660
But vetrix... isn't
this the trap card that...

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.990
think of it as a last resort.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.630
In case things don't
go as well as you hope.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.430
If you do use the card, you will
both suffer the consequences.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.330
Of course, I sincerely hope that
you won't be forced to use it.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.130
But, what if...

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.260
you did say you'd do whatever it
takes to beat yuma, didn't you?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.360
You may have a
chance to prove it.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.560
I activate the
trap final prophecy!

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.290
I'll have to destroy my equip
card, reducing my monster's

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.590
attack points, but it also stops
and destroys your trap card!

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.690
No way! You were willing to make

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.590
atlandis weaker just
to destroy my trap card?

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.960
Yes, but it's still
strong enough to beat you.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.860
Especially since you
only have 100 life points.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.560
Keep up your attack, atlandis!

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.160
Crush utopia ray and yuma!

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.490
I activate another
trap card, half unbreak!

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.230
Not only does it shield utopia
ray from being destroyed,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.530
but it also cuts
the damage in half!

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.090
Yuma...

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.690
You cannot win...

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.590
Trey!

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.230
You have to stop before
this duel destroys you.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.930
I don't care!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.130
You're in my family's way and
I'll beat you no matter what!

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.860
You've got it wrong!

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.330
I'm not your enemy, I just
wanna be friends with you!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.830
That will never happen, yuma.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.260
I don't need friends.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.230
We all need friends, Trey!

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.660
Maybe if we talk this
through, I can find some way

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.230
to help you and your family!

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.390
Thank you yuma,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.960
but it's too late
for both of us.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.760
Too late for what, Trey?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.530
Unfortunately for us, the
final prophecy trap that

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.990
I used will lead
to our destruction!

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.230
On my next turn, we'll both take
damage equal to machu mech's

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.090
attack points, and
we'll both be destroyed.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.830
Now what?

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.230
I'm not sure...

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.890
But it looks like this place is
gonna lose a lot of real estate!

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.290
Soon you and I will each be
down to zero life points

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.560
and that finally
will be the end of it.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.760
And I don't just mean
the end of our contest.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.830
This is going to be the last
duel either of us ever has!

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.390
I feel at peace because I
know there really was no other

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.860
way to save my family and I'm
sure vetrix will be proud of me.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.390
Someday soon, my family
will return to normal.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.760
But Trey, this
isn't the answer...

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.690
the effect from that
final prophecy trap

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.360
is still goin' strong!

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.330
It's gonna destroy
everything here.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.830
The trap can't
hurt us, though.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.590
It's part of this
virtual world.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.130
In the end, it
really isn't there.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.660
No way!

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.460
Even without my duel gazer, I
can see that final prophecy Trap

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.460
zapping everything in sight!

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.760
This is real!

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.490
That final prophecy Trap
is gonna zap us... for real!

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.260
We don't have much time!

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.790
What're we gonna do?

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.960
Hey Trey... tell me...

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.490
what is that thing?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.260
I'm not really sure.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.730
It's from another
dimension, I think.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.130
Trey!

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.460
It's no use.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.030
The final prophecy
Card cannot be stopped.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.990
Not even my crest is powerful
enough to hold it back!

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.460
Vetrix!

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.530
Your card doesn't just
eliminate the duelists,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.760
it destroys the whole world!

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.630
It appears that Trey used
the trap card I gave him.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.860
Quinton: Vetrix... don't
tell me you gave Trey the

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.890
final prophecy card?

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.730
It is creating a portal to
barian world just as I foresaw!

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.930
Once the portal fully opens,
it can't be closed again!

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.130
Hey Trey!

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.690
I need answers, what's going on?

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.130
Our duel is opening a portal in
This world to another dimension.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.030
And in a short time, everything
around us is going to be

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.760
swallowed up by it.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.260
Everything?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.830
Us, too?

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.960
Please don't swallow me!

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.930
I swear I don't taste very good!

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.730
Trust me, when I
activated that card

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.160
I didn't realize it would
devour the whole world.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.590
Please forgive me, yuma.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.660
Time to feel the flow!

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.060
You just told me that this
inter-Dimensional portal is

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.190
opening up because of our duel.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.660
So all I have to do is defeat
you and that should keep the

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.830
portal from opening anymore!

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.360
You can't win!

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.890
Since I have less than a
thousand life points right now,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.630
you can't destroy atlandis, or

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.660
deal ANY battle damage to me.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.930
The situation we're in
is utterly hopeless.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.590
It's not hopeless!

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:47.030
As long as I don't give up,
then we all still have a chance!

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.960
If astral were here he
would agree with me...

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.090
zexal...

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.630
what's that?

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.060
It's a mysterious power that
astral and I brought about.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.360
But now... he's gone...

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.560
because of me.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.760
Yuma!

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.730
What if you could
bring astral back?

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.330
How could I do that?

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.490
I used the power of the crest to
make astral disappear from here.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.760
If I can transfer the crest
over to you then perhaps...

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.690
Wait, you really think
I could bring astral back?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.860
Yes, But if you fail to gain
control of the crest's power,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.590
then it will gain
control of you.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.730
I'll risk it... it's worth
it to bring astral back.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.890
Alright, give me the
power of the crest Trey.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.190
Astral, come back!

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.890
Astral!

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.690
KAZUMA: Astral...

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.330
it's you!

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.730
Hello, astral.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.290
My son is calling for you.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.730
Please, you must
go and help yuma.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.690
Yuma...

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.630
yuma.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.530
I can't believe...
you're back.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.260
I heard you were
calling for me, so I came.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.490
I'm glad... you're here.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.460
Not that... I need
your help or anything.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.230
Everything's gonna be
okay cause astral's back!

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.290
Great.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.860
Forget me.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.730
Destroy atlandis
before it's too late!

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.490
It is time for zexal!

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.960
Right!

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.160
So, let's do this!

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.960
Now you and I will build
the overlay network!

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.860
What're they doin'?

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.660
When two distant
souls become one,

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.830
the power of zexal is revealed!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.930
Go zexal morph!

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.290
Yuma and astral
just merged together!

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.990
Let's get this done.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.760
A truly powerful duelist can
shape the outcome of a duel.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.660
He can even generate the very
card that he needs to draw!

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.190
Go shining draw!

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.890
Appear, zexal weapon!

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.690
Phoenix bow!

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.430
I equip it on to utopia ray!

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.660
Now When utopia ray attacks,
your monster is automatically

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.490
destroyed, and you take 1000

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.460
points of damage!

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.360
Get ready, utopia ray!

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.930
Attack Atlandis now!

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.160
Phoenix finish!

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.930
The bond between yuma and astral
is stronger than I realized!

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.230
It's Trey!

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.190
He was... defeated!

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.290
What will happen to him now?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.490
Whoa...

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.930
Hey, look!

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.560
It's the real world!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.460
And there's no sign
of that freaky trap!

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.830
Then it can't devour us!

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.590
in the end, we're all ok!

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.830
I won the duel?

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.830
Yuma...

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.960
we have saved your world.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.390
Yeah, that was great teamwork!

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.730
But...

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.090
what about Trey?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.430
Hey, Trey!

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.530
You okay?

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.660
Here, lemme help you.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.330
Are you hurt?

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.560
I finally understand, yuma.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.890
You accept me as I really am.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.390
I can see clearly now that

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.060
you're the only
True friend I have.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.860
Look Trey, I'm sorry if I...

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.790
yuma, I have a favor to ask you.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.890
Will you do what you
can to help save my family?

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.630
If you just keep
"feelin the flow",

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.090
I'm sure you'll find a
way to make things right.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.560
Trey!

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.460
Goodbye...

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.990
yuma!

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.790
Alright, you won your
last heart piece just in time!

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.860
So you made it to the finals!

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.430
Yuma?

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.790
I promise I'm not going to
let my friend Trey down.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.460
I will find a way
to help his family.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.490
There's no stopping me now!

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.490
I failed you, vetrix.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.030
Forgive me.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.430
Everything will
be alright, Trey.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.760
I promise you.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.230
Vetrix, will you...

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.630
hold my hand?

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.290
That's much better.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.730
I think I'll try
to get some sleep now.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.760
Don't let your mind be troubled.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.990
Rest Well, Trey.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.530
Rest until I settle things with
the son of kazuma tsukumo.
