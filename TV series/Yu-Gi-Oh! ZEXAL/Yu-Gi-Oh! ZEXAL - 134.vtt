WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
(Yuma)
Last time on
"YuGiOh Zexal"'

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.707
(Orbital 7)
One photon mile
to lunar t-t-touchdown.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.682
Act-activate propulsion
mode!

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.722
What is that thing?

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.763
(Kite) Mizar.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.331
About time.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.203
Girag and Alito
are no more, Yuma.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.105
And I have their powers.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.439
But they won't be lonely.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.742
They'll be with Dumon
and Marin.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:43.744
(Yuma) No way!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:48.015
Next I'll crush you, Astral
and the rest of the Emperors

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.618
and then the Numeron Code
will be mine!

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.521
This duel has been a
long time in the making.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.658
It has brought our two
Galaxy-Eyes together.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.060
Their union will
also act as a key.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.363
A key to unlocking
the Numeron Code.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.002
Let us duel!
Let's duel!

(both) Let's duel!

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:16.737
All right, Mizar.

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:21.008
Let's find out which one of us
is the true Galaxy-Eyes master!

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.745
I'll lead off by summoning
Photon Thrasher.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.286
I'm also summoning
Overlay Booster.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.555
I can do that since I
already have a monster

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.558
with more than 2000
attack points.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:44.564
And now, I'll tribute them
to bring out the real reason

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.333
we're here.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:50.537
Here comes the monster
more savage than a supernova.

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:56.209
With the cataclysmic force
of 10 black holes put together.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.380
A cosmic scourge that vaporizes
anything in its path.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.750
Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.752
Magnificent.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.121
I place one card facedown.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.656
It's your turn, Mizar.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:13.260
You truly are my most
worthy adversary, Kite.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.096
All the same, I must
annihilate you!

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:19.766
There is far too much at stake
for me to hold back because

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.270
there may only be
one Galaxy-Eyes master

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.539
and that honor will go to me!

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.141
This would be an excellent
time to begin to tremble,

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.511
because my next move will
pave the way for your defeat.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.315
I activate Rank-Up Magic,
The Seventh One!

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.249
Here it comes.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.188
Appear in all your fearsome
terror, Number 107...

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:44.391
Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:51.765
Impressive as ever!

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.735
Yes, but what makes it
even more formidable

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.636
is that Rank-Up Magic,
The Seventh One

00:03:56.636 --> 00:04:00.574
ranks up Galaxy-Eyes
into a Chaos Number.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.143
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:07.180
Face the multiverse and ignite
new life into my great beast.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.154
Come forth Chaos Number 107...
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.271
(Kite)
Taking down his
Galaxy-Eyes won't be easy.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.441
That dragon is every duelist's
worst nightmare.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.243
Luckily, I have
the one card that will give me

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.479
the best chance at beating it...
Galaxy Shockwave.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.150
I activate Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon's

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.484
special ability!

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.753
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:49.623
not only does it negate all
your cards' effects,

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.559
but it transcends time
and returns all your cards

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.762
to the way they were at the
beginning of the turn.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.431
Its special ability also
prevents you from activating

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.201
any cards on your field
without my permission.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:05.739
So you had better be nice to me
because I call the shots now.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.208
For instance, I bet you
were planning to use

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:12.746
your facedown card against me,
but I just made that impossible!

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:14.347
That's a minor setback.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.249
I still plan on
walking away the winner.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.086
Then perhaps a major setback
will bring you back to reality.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.490
Neo Tachyon, take out
Kite's Photon Dragon!

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.561
This means it's the perfect time
to activate Galaxy Tyranno's

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.029
special ability.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.265
I can use Galaxy-Eyes Photon
Dragon and Galaxy Tyranno

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:36.670
to Xyz Summon and Galaxy
Tyranno counts as two monsters.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.739
You're Xyz Summoning
while under attack?

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.441
You don't have
the guts to pull this off

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.111
because unlike you I'm always
thinking 20 steps ahead.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.013
Now try to keep up.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.216
I'm taking this duel
to the next level.

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:52.385
I'm overlaying
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.187
and my two Tyrannos.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.757
With these three monsters, I
build the Overlay Network

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.192
and Xyz Summon.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.294
Prepare to witness
the mightiest of monsters.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:06.266
With the power of this beast,
the battle is over!

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.738
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.015
Well done, Kite.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:25.418
Now our two Galaxy-Eyes can
battle claw to claw.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.553
That's right.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.621
But only one can win.

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.589
And it's going to
be my Dragon.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.758
(Orbital 7)
That-that's the spirit!

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.261
It's my fault.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:36.396
I failed them all, Astral.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.664
I thought I could help them.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:40.467
They were Barians, but
they were my friends.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:46.039
I couldn't protect
Alito or even Girag.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.109
The same with Marin and Dumon.

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.176
When it was all on the line,

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.712
I couldn't do a thing
to save anyone!

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.148
Vector and Don Thousand
took them all.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.752
Nothing I've done so
far has made any difference.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.187
What is that?

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.155
Do not be discouraged.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.358
You still may have a chance to
make a difference Yuma.

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.293
Look at the moon.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.762
Something is happening there.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:13.733
Hey, what's up with those
two shiny lights?

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.467
I know.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:15.735
It is two
Galaxy-Eyes.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.738
They are battling on
the lunar surface.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:22.142
It's got to be Kite!

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:24.311
We are at in interesting
crossroads, Mizar.

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.747
My Dragon can't use any
special abilities this turn.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.749
But it can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:33.353
Since both our Dragons have the
same number of attack points,

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:35.255
you'd be foolish to attack me.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.425
That may be how your
narrow human mind sees it,

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.526
but I do not agree.

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:42.762
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon, attack!

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:46.566
Take aim with Ultimate Tachyon
Spiral of Destruction!

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:49.736
Neo Galaxy-Eyes,
strike back and show us all

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.007
that you're the one,
true Galaxy-Eyes.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:59.746
I would never allow you
to destroy my Galaxy-Eyes.

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:00.647
What?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.482
I activate Galaxy Shockwave!

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.752
This spell boosts the attack
power of my Galaxy-Eyes

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.755
by 1500 points.

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:11.324
And there is more
bad news for you.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.759
Galaxy Shockwave also cancels

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.762
your Photon Dragon's
special abilities,

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:19.199
so it can now be
destroyed in battle again.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:26.239
Now that your Galaxy-Eyes
has been destroyed,

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.041
the duel is mine!

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.052
(Orbital 7)
Master Kite,
please let me help you.

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.420
Get real.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.754
I am.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:42.756
It-it's what you
designed me to do, sir.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.759
You b-b-brought me online to
serve you exactly six years,

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:50.697
151 days, five-five hours
and 33 s-s-seconds ago.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.533
Remember when you first
built me, you created me

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.404
for one purpose: to c-c-care
for your brother, Hart!

00:08:57.404 --> 00:09:00.173
Thanks to you, I was
the most high-tech nanny

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:00.740
ever-ever assembled.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:05.612
I loved every minute of my job,
even at its stinkiest moments.

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.080
When it came to
looking after Hart,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.716
I-I never dropped the ball
or the baby.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.752
And I really soared when
you b-b-became a Number Hunter.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.321
I've always been there for
you, Master K-K-Kite,

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.391
no matter how
shocking the circumstances.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.592
I do not need your help.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:23.196
Sometimes your at-attitude
really makes my servos spin.

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:24.764
You need me more
than ever this time,

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.267
b-b-but you're too proud
to see it clearly.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.735
In-In-In fact,
there's lots of things

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.438
you haven't been seeing
clearly lately.

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:35.041
Ever since you were injured
in that duel with Heartland,

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.744
your vision hasn't
b-b-been the same.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.046
But even though your eyes
have got a glitch,

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.347
you-you don't
have to worry

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:45.752
'cause my optical circuits
are fully functional.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.187
I-I can be your eyes!

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:50.090
All right, link me
into your visual systems.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.725
C-c-commencing
ocular interface.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:53.760
Data flow enabled.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:56.729
Synching
neocor-cor-cortex inputs.

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:57.764
Visual linkup complete!

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.767
You-You're back to 20/20,
Master Kite!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.270
Great, now don't bother
me for the rest of the duel.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.273
I'll take that
as a "thank y-you."

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:07.740
Enough!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.576
I have been more than patient.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.743
It is your move, Kite.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.280
(Kite)
Mizar played Galaxy Shockwave,
the same card I have.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.050
It 's a safe guess that we" 're
dueling with similar decks.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.520
This duel could go either way,
but I can't afford to lose.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.756
Which means I'll have
to think outside the box.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.493
And that means drawing on
the power of a legend

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:29.529
and hoping
there's truth to the tale.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.363
This better pay off

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.066
'cause there's a lot
riding on my next move.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:35.702
Only one way to find out.

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:40.373
By using the legends and
letting their power guide me.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.643
(rumbling)

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.281
What is happening?

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:53.753
Here goes.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.089
I draw!

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.025
I'll start with:
Galaxy Rebirth.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.629
This spell lets me bring back a
Galaxy monster from my graveyard

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:04.364
by halving its attack points

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.300
and then Galaxy Rebirth
equips on to my monster.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.137
Come on back,
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.373
Is that all you have got, Kite?

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:17.744
Your revived Photon Dragon is
far too weak to threaten me.

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:18.478
I know.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.747
But Galaxy Rebirth
has another effect.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.749
It's treated as a monster
with the same Level

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:26.186
as Galaxy Eyes Photon
Dragon when I Xyz Summon.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.756
See, Mizar, I'm not attacking
you with my Photon Dragon,

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:32.492
I'm overlaying it
with Galaxy Rebirth.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:36.129
With these two monsters, I
build the Overlay Network

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:38.097
and Xyz Summon!

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.435
This will change everything.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:49.576
I'll bring into existence a
Dragon never seen before!

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:57.584
Now arise, Number 62...
Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon!

00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:59.552
A new Galaxy-Eyes?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.187
Impossible!

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.393
How can this be?

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:17.670
All the forces of the universe
gather at this moment in time!

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.621
How did you create
a new Galaxy-Eyes?

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:37.757
By trusting my hunch that
there was truth to the legend.

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:41.694
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon has
been reborn as a Number

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.763
and has taken a
terrifying new form:

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:46.699
Galaxy-Eyes Prime
Photon Dragon.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.469
It looks like Kite and
Mizar are dueling for keeps.

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:53.706
And the winner gains the key
to the Numeron Code.

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.174
One of us will end this duel

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:58.244
as the true Galaxy-Eyes
master, Mizar.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:01.047
I'm going to prove
once and for all it's me.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:04.384
Let's get started,
Prime Photon Dragon.

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:05.652
Its special ability ranks up

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:08.454
all monsters on
the field by one.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.192
What an odd strategy.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:18.531
You do realize you have ranked
up my Neo Tachyon as well.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:19.465
I know.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:23.002
Prime Photon,
attack Neo Tachyon!

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:25.138
My Neo Tachyon is too strong.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.273
Your Number will
lose this battle.

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.141
Don't count on that.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.743
Prime Photon, activate
your special ability.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:34.280
Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon
Dragon gains attack points equal

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.751
to the Rank of all the monsters
on the field multiplied by 200!

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:42.255
Prime Photon and Neo Tachyon
have a combined Rank of 19.

00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:46.759
Multiply that by 200 and
that equals big trouble for you.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.529
It is more powerful
than my Dragon now!

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:54.233
Attack with Eternity
Photon Stream!

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:15.321
(Orbital 7)
You-you did it,
Master K-K-Kite!

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.491
Ah, Mercury looks so romantic
from-from here.

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:19.759
It reminds me of Lillybot.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:23.396
I wish I c-c-could've shown
her how heroic I was.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:26.999
We make a great team,
don 't-don" 't we, Master Kite?

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.374
What's got you
going, Lillybot?

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.008
Lillybot felt it.

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.077
Huh...
What did you feel?

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:38.511
Love.

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:41.748
I sense my sweetie is engaged
in feats of derring-do!

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.649
I must see him in action.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.751
What...
Your "sweetie"?

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:46.586
You won't be seeing anyone.

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:48.321
The systems are down, remember?

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:52.458
Yes, but love conquers
all, even tech support.

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:55.661
No way!

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.497
It booted up.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.739
Is that Kite?

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.247
Kite!

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.249
Now what's he doing?

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.718
A duel in space?

00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:20.420
Be careful.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.588
You may have summoned
a new Number, Kite,

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:27.193
but as you will soon see, I
have some surprises of my own.

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:30.596
You will find this one
especially upsetting!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.466
I activate Tachyon Chaos Hole!

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.736
When my Tachyon Dragon is
destroyed in battle,

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:41.474
this trap banishes all
the cards on your field.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:42.742
My cards!

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:47.747
Your Prime Photon will now
return to the realm of legend!

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:54.086
I place one card facedown.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.154
Your turn, Mizar.

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:59.258
(Yuma)
Without his new Number,
Kite doesn't stand a chance!

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.293
Oh no.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.161
This is just terrible.

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:05.731
We will never unlock
the secret to the Numeron Code.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.767
(Orbital 7)
You don't stand alone,
Master K-K-Kite.

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.736
I 'll-I" 'll be here
with you to the bitter end.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.740
Yes but you have no idea just
how nasty it will be.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.744
I begin my turn by
activating Tachyon Chaos Hole

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:20.346
from my graveyard!

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:23.216
Which means I can
summon an old ally.

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:26.586
I am sure you have been
missing its company.

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:30.490
Arise again, Chaos Number 107!

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.026
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:44.737
(Orbital 7)
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tach-Tachyon Dragon!

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.706
Nothing to do but
hope for the best.

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:49.075
Yuma, perhaps we should
be more realistic.

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:50.743
Let us brace for the worst.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.212
Without your Prime
Photon Dragon,

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.281
you are completely vulnerable.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:58.718
Tachyon Dragon,
attack Kite directly!

00:16:58.718 --> 00:17:00.753
Complete our victory!

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.189
We 're-we" 're
dragon fodder!

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.756
Take it easy.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:06.325
This fight's not as done
as you think, Mizar.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:09.128
I activate the trap
Double Dragon Descent.

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:12.632
This trap lets me summon a
Dragon-Type Xyz Monster

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:15.735
of my own

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:19.405
and I luckily I know
just the one to choose.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.740
(Jinlon) Kite!

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:23.543
I must speak with Mizar.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.512
Summon me to the field.

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:27.213
All right.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.714
I'll do as you ask.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:32.251
I summon Number 46...
Dragluon!

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:39.158
What...
Can it be?

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:42.295
Pardon me for
interrupting your duel.

00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:43.129
Jinlon!

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:46.732
Open your mind to learn
the true secrets of your past,

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.100
my student.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.271
This duel will unlock your
long forgotten memories.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.506
It's time, Mizar.

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:56.676
Double Dragon Descent's
additional effect activates.

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:58.744
This trap increases
Dragluon's attack points

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.315
until it has the same amount
as your Tachyon Dragon.

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:09.355
Dragluon, attack
with Emerald Fire Strike!

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:23.502
(Jinlon)
In distant times, a dragon
dwelled in the lands of mankind.

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.671
You, Mizar, were my
closest friend,

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:29.575
until the day a false prophet's
lies changed everything.

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.744
Having fallen under
the sway of his guile,

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:36.382
the villagers forced us
to turn on each other.

00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:38.150
Who was that prophet?

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:42.521
Recall the truth, Mizar.

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:45.725
(laughing)

00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:46.559
Who are you?

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.760
I am Don Thousand.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.164
For a long time, I have
had my eyes on you, Mizar.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.766
You are a great warrior.

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:57.737
Your nobility and selflessness
has earned you a place

00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:59.739
among the pantheon of heroes.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:04.610
But that is exactly why I cannot
risk allowing you to oppose me.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.747
Instead, I have
decided that you will serve me

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.651
as I carry out my plans
to rule the universe.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:15.755
And so I will
revive you as a Barian!

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:19.692
Mizar, this is not who
you were meant to be.

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.761
Don Thousand has
twisted your fate.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:25.998
He altered your memories in
order to further his plans.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:29.502
Mizar, this duel is
your last chance

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:33.472
to set your soul
on the right path.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:35.708
Can what he told me be true?

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.744
(Kite)
So that's what
really happened to Mizar.

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.323
It cannot be.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.760
(Orbital 7)
Life support systems
cr-critical!

00:19:54.994 --> 00:19:57.763
Damage at 70%!

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:58.764
Mizar!
Nonsense.

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.766
I almost believed
that old fool's lie.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:04.136
The thought of nearly being
tricked sickens me.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:09.675
Human foolishness
must be rubbing off on me.

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:10.743
Did you enjoy that?

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:14.613
A rare moment of doubt
unlikely to ever happen again.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.483
It was true.

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:20.152
The only truth you should
concern yourself with

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:23.222
is that I activate my
spell Galaxy Rebirth!

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.525
I can bring back a Galaxy
monster from my graveyard

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:28.527
with half its attack points.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:31.497
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:33.766
Arise, my friend!

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:37.303
Every duel has a
beginning and an end.

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:38.738
This is yours!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:43.476
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon,
attack Kite directly.

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:48.114
You may experience an
excruciating burning sensation.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.985
He's done for!

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:55.654
Kite...
No!

00:20:55.654 --> 00:21:00.760
If you have any last words, now
would be a good time for them!

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:09.421
