00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:03.731
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:06.801
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.069
Quinton and I built it.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.971
It's an interdimensional
teleporter.

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:13.608
We're going to force open the
portal to another dimension...

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.910
and send you to Astral World.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.580
It could very well
be a one-way trip.

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:23.184
I don't care it's a risk
I'm totally willing to take!

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:25.153
(Quinton)
Charge up the Astralite!

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:27.455
When it reaches maximum
strength, we'll release all

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:30.191
the stored energy in a single
burst that'll create

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.727
a wormhole to Astral World!

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:33.661
(Tori) Hey guys, look!

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.531
The teleporter's
fully charged!

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.568
Hey, don't mess this up!

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:43.504
Go find Astral and
bring him back, Yuma!

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:46.441
Will do!

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.510
You know I'll come
back, right Tori?

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.178
Yes...

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:52.413
If you promise you will, Yuma!

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:56.050
Yeah, I promise, Tori.

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:01.522
I'm on my way, Astral.

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:04.092
I'm gonna find you and bring you
back with me no matter what it

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:08.963
takes... because

Whoa!

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.731
Is that Astral World?

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.166
Quinton and Kite did it!

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:19.901
They got me here!

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.871
Well almost.

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.641
What was that?

00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.577
Hey! I know you!

00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:35.183
You're my dad's lucky
Rainbow Kuriboh!

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:38.186
Hey, wait up!

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.156
Where you going?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.194
Oh, I get it!

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:50.531
You want me to follow
you to Astral World!

00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:21.129
Whoa, what happened?

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.499
This must be Astral World!

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.167
Kinda gloomy...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.004
Now I know where
Astral gets it from.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.541
Cool looking city.

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:37.178
But it's so big, how am
I ever gonna find Astral?

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:41.115
It could take like forever.

00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:41.883
What's all this?

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:44.685
Looks like someone forgot
to water the plants.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.787
Wonder what happened?

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:50.191
They're like, everywhere!

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.436
Whoa! What'd I do?

00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:04.872
What did I do?

00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:13.114
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:15.816
You could've hurt me you know!

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:16.717
Whoa...

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:18.920
Who or what are you?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.656
So you are Yuma Tsukumo.

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:22.190
Hold up!

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.858
How do you know my name?

00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:25.693
You should not be here.

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:28.796
You must be contained.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:32.833
Nice pups...

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.169
Cute little pooches...

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:40.708
Call off the mutts!

00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:04.799
This is handy.

00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:12.440
(Mizar) Impossible!

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.041
I tell you, Mizar, it is true!

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:16.744
I returned to the underground
temple where I first

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:19.180
witnessed the strange visions.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.415
While I stood there,
slowly but surely,

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:25.186
the images in my mind
became clearer, more vivid!

00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:28.956
It was as if lost memories
were returning to me!

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:31.859
They told of a time
before I was a Barian!

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:34.795
A long time ago,
when I was human!

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:37.164
But by that logic, then
the visions I had...

00:05:37.164 --> 00:05:40.167
Were your memories, from
when you lived as a human.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:42.703
I know this is something
you still do not believe.

00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:46.073
But if the legends at the
ruins reveal our memories,

00:05:46.073 --> 00:05:49.744
then I believe
I have found Nash.

00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:54.181
Wait, you are putting your trust
in some sort of fairytale?

00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.951
Yes Mizar.

00:05:57.184 --> 00:05:59.587
Thanks for saving me!

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:04.025
Now let's steer clear of
the walking light bulb!

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:07.595
Guess I spoke too soon!

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.167
Wasn't he behind
us a second ago?

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:16.470
Forget behind us!
He's all around us!

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.173
Oh, man! We're
completely surrounded!

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:22.176
Looks like we're sunk!

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.180
Whoa! You're
incredible!

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.915
You totally gave him the slip!

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:31.686
He's never gonna
find us down here!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.622
Aww, c'mon, seriously?

00:06:34.622 --> 00:06:38.192
That's it! No more
speaking too soon!

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.170
Kuriboh!

00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:10.191
Kuriboh, you've got so many
tricks up your fins...

00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:12.827
First you turn into a boat,
then into a submarine.

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:15.496
But honestly, the only trick
I'd love to see you do next

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:18.966
is lead me to
straight to Astral.

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:22.837
<i>Hey, Yuma.</i>

00:07:22.837 --> 00:07:25.005
It's... my dad!

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:26.173
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:27.575
<i>Astral is in danger.</i>

00:07:27.575 --> 00:07:28.509
Okay.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:31.512
<i>The Guardian of this worldhas</i>
<i>passed judgment on him.</i>

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:34.915
<i>Astral has been deemeda</i>
<i>danger to the people here.</i>

00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:36.183
<i>He will be erased!</i>

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:38.085
I won't let that happen!

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:41.188
<i>Rainbow Kuriboh willguide you to Astral.</i>

00:07:41.188 --> 00:07:42.056
<i>Be safe.</i>

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:43.724
<i>Yuma, I'm counting on you.</i>

00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:47.862
<i>You're the only one
who can save him.</i>

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:50.398
Dad...

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.034
All right!
Let's get going!

00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:56.537
And save Astral!

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.844
(Shark)
Rio, I don't know what
to think anymore.

00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:08.847
I have like two sets of memories
that don't go together.

00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:11.883
How could I have been in a car
crash if I was fighting Vector

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:13.318
in ancient times?

00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:17.389
Then our family crest is
the same as the Barians?

00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:18.991
What's going on?

00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:20.859
If I only had some answers.

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:23.095
But even if I did have some
answers, I don't know if they'd

00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:25.964
make things clearer or
just more confusing...

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:29.935
Nothing makes sense anymore.

00:08:31.236 --> 00:08:34.906
Hey! What are you
doing here, Dumon?

00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:36.375
You better be
dropping off flowers!

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:39.144
I'm here because you
need to know the truth.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:43.148
Reginald Kastle, your real
name is Nash and you are one

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:46.385
of the seven Barian Emperors.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.389
(Yuma)
Stay on its tail
Goblindbergh!

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:53.392
All the way to Astral!

00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.884
Okay, you got me!
What do you want?

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:23.288
You will leave this world
on your own or by my hand.

00:09:23.288 --> 00:09:23.922
Your choice!

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:25.757
Gimme Astral and I'll leave.

00:09:25.757 --> 00:09:28.393
That will not happen.

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:36.735
This guy really
doesn't want me around!

00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:53.752
Kuri, Kuri?

00:09:53.752 --> 00:09:56.822
Rainbow Kuriboh...

00:09:56.822 --> 00:09:59.391
Where am I now?

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:04.196
<i>(Enna) ln a safe place where you can</i>
<i>rest and hide from Eliphas,</i>

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:08.767
<i>until you are ready to</i>
<i>continue your mission.</i>

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:10.368
Who are you?

00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:14.172
My name is Enna.

00:10:14.172 --> 00:10:14.740
Enna...

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.343
Are you the one who saved
me and brought me here?

00:10:18.343 --> 00:10:19.111
I am.

00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.378
How can I thank you?

00:10:20.378 --> 00:10:23.315
I only ask that you
save the others.

00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:24.382
You got it!

00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:26.151
Who needs saving?

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:28.653
These are the ones
that need your help.

00:10:28.653 --> 00:10:32.057
Like myself, each is an
inhabitant of this world,

00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:34.392
but tragically they
have become ill.

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:38.096
Their life force weakens
with each breath they take.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.598
But there's so many!

00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:42.334
How am I supposed
to help them all?

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:43.368
Simply touch them.

00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:47.239
What do you mean?

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:50.375
It can't be that easy?

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.810
It is, please.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.712
Share your life force
with this boy.

00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:56.248
He needs you.

00:10:57.382 --> 00:10:58.316
Okay.

00:10:58.316 --> 00:10:59.951
Here goes.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:03.388
You mean just like this?

00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:12.364
How'd I do that?

00:11:12.364 --> 00:11:14.232
There is a spark
within you that

00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:16.234
no longer exists on this world.

00:11:16.234 --> 00:11:17.636
Where'd it go?

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:21.239
Long ago the people of Astral
World saw this spark,

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:23.909
this chaos energy as
something dangerous,

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:25.977
something that needed
to be eliminated.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:29.014
We thought we were doing the
right thing, but we were wrong.

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.383
By purging ourselves of
this energy, we lost part

00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:35.086
of ourselves and now our
planet is suffering.

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:37.956
You are our only hope.

00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:40.292
No way...

00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.264
Yuma, you are our only hope.

00:11:46.264 --> 00:11:48.133
If our world is
to have a chance,

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:51.369
you must free Astral
before he is erased.

00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:57.742
You must go now for the
Guardian will soon be here.

00:11:58.376 --> 00:11:59.644
I'm gonna save you, Astral!

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.614
And together we're
gonna save your world!

00:12:02.614 --> 00:12:04.883
Kuri, Kuri!

00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:10.889
Kuri!

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:12.123
Kuri, Kuri!

00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:14.960
Astral's up there,
Rainbow Kuriboh?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.027
All right.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.730
Let's get moving!

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.336
Yuma has been here.

00:12:24.336 --> 00:12:25.370
Yes, Eliphas.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.805
He has helped us all.

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:28.073
No, he did not.

00:12:28.073 --> 00:12:31.743
He has infected you
as he did Astral.

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:33.278
You will pay for your actions,

00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:37.048
but first I must take
care of the boy.

00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:55.734
Astral, are you here?

00:13:11.783 --> 00:13:14.386
Astral! I found you!

00:13:16.388 --> 00:13:18.390
Astral!

00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:21.393
All right, I found you at last!

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:23.194
Now I'm bustin'
you out of here.

00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:25.630
So let's get going!

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:29.334
Snap out of it!

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:29.968
Let's go!

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:33.204
(Eliphas)
You are not
going anywhere.

00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:34.172
You're...

00:13:34.172 --> 00:13:38.376
I am the Guardian
of Astral World.

00:13:39.244 --> 00:13:41.780
Those that I protect
call me Eliphas.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.316
Well, listen up,
Astral's coming with me!

00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:46.017
No, he is not.

00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:46.985
Why?

00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:48.386
Astral was born with
a twin purpose:

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:51.823
to destroy Barian World and
to guide our world towards

00:13:51.823 --> 00:13:54.259
its destiny of
evolving its power.

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:59.364
But to carry out his duties,
he needed to remain pure.

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:03.835
Your chaos energy has infected
him and he has been tainted.

00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:05.837
He is no longer pure.

00:14:05.837 --> 00:14:08.173
He must be erased.

00:14:08.173 --> 00:14:09.374
This is all my fault?

00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:15.146
He's getting rid of Astral,
all 'cause of me?

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.250
Astral, I...

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:20.919
Wait a second!

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:21.953
I didn't "taint" him!

00:14:21.953 --> 00:14:23.989
I never did anything
to hurt him.

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:24.689
We helped each other!

00:14:24.689 --> 00:14:27.292
Sure Astral may have
changed a bit 'cause of me.

00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:29.227
But I changed 'cause
of him, too!

00:14:29.227 --> 00:14:29.894
We changed together!

00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:33.765
Every time we laughed, or when
we cried; even when we argued,

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:35.767
and especially when we dueled,

00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:37.035
we always did
everything together!

00:14:37.035 --> 00:14:41.139
He's like a part of me,
and I'm like a part of him!

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:42.807
I already lost Astral once

00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:45.076
and I'm not letting
that happen again!

00:14:45.076 --> 00:14:50.315
Free my friend now, Eliphas,
or face the consequences!

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.384
What's it gonna be?

00:14:52.384 --> 00:14:56.221
I will not let Astral
leave this world.

00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:58.223
Then let's duel!

00:14:58.223 --> 00:14:59.290
Very well.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.392
Here are my terms.

00:15:00.392 --> 00:15:01.760
Win and he goes free.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.361
Lose and you do not!

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.964
I don't like
the sound of that!

00:15:05.964 --> 00:15:06.765
Choose now.

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.367
Okay, fine!
You got it!

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.903
Let's do this!

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:17.375
Duel Disk go!

00:15:18.943 --> 00:15:22.280
Duel Gazer let's roll!

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.783
Let us duel!
Let's duel!

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.389
Let us duel!
Let's duel!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.192
I shall go first!

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:40.632
(Yuma)
If Eliphas is guarding this
entire planet all by himself,

00:15:40.632 --> 00:15:44.035
he's gotta be really
tough to beat!

00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:45.603
But I can't let that
psych me out,

00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:48.006
'cause I have to win this duel!

00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:54.312
I activate two copies of the
spell Mysterious Monolith!

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:56.381
These arcane statues allow me

00:15:56.614 --> 00:16:00.085
to summon a Rank 4 Xyz Monster.

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:00.652
What?

00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:03.388
There are spell cards
that let you Xyz Summon?

00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:09.360
Watch as I overlay my
two Mysterious Monoliths!

00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:11.362
With these two cards,

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:16.768
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon...

00:16:17.368 --> 00:16:20.772
the all mighty New Order 4!

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:23.374
Etheric Anubis!

00:16:28.313 --> 00:16:32.917
Then I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:37.122
Hope that monster isn't as
powerful as it is scary.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.356
It's my turn!

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:41.893
Here goes... I draw!

00:16:41.893 --> 00:16:43.995
Rainbow Kuriboh?
All right!

00:16:43.995 --> 00:16:47.031
You're gonna stick around
and duel with me too, huh?

00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:49.667
Kuri, Kuri!
That's awesome.

00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:53.771
I summon Ganbara Knight!

00:16:56.374 --> 00:17:00.945
That lets me also
summon Kagetokage!

00:17:06.117 --> 00:17:11.156
Next I overlay my Level 4
Ganbara Knight and Kagetokage!

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:14.359
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:20.899
and Xyz Summon
Number 39: Utopia!

00:17:25.937 --> 00:17:28.373
Utopia should not even exist!

00:17:28.373 --> 00:17:31.609
That Number is a disgusting
abomination created by the

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:34.379
revolting alliance you
formed with Astral!

00:17:34.612 --> 00:17:36.748
Watch what you say
about my monster...

00:17:36.748 --> 00:17:39.817
And for the record my bond
with Astral is not revolting!

00:17:39.817 --> 00:17:43.388
And it's much more than an
alliance, it's a friendship,

00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:47.392
and Utopia is a symbol of that!

00:17:47.392 --> 00:17:48.226
I see.

00:17:48.226 --> 00:17:49.894
This means I can destroy
your friendship

00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:52.764
by destroying your Utopia!

00:17:52.764 --> 00:17:54.299
(Yuma)
How's he think he's
gonna do that

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:56.801
when only a Number
can destroy a Number?

00:17:56.801 --> 00:17:58.937
Something's not right here.

00:17:58.937 --> 00:18:02.373
There must be some reason
why he summoned that monster.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.375
I wish I knew what to do next.

00:18:04.609 --> 00:18:06.277
(Astral) Yuma...

00:18:06.277 --> 00:18:09.080
You know what you have to do.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.283
Feel the flow, Yuma.

00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:14.385
Words to live by, Astral!

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.053
Here goes!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:20.758
I activate the equip
spell Reverse Breaker!

00:18:21.292 --> 00:18:24.128
I equip this card on Utopia.

00:18:24.128 --> 00:18:27.365
Then I'll have my
Utopia attack Anubis!

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:30.134
Now you'll find out
why I equipped Utopia

00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:31.369
with Reverse Breaker!

00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:35.340
See every time Utopia attacks,
it destroys one of your spells

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.375
or traps, and you
can't activate

00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:39.377
any other spells
or traps either.

00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:43.648
Say bye-bye
to your facedown!

00:18:46.384 --> 00:18:48.953
And while you're at it,
you might as well say

00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:51.222
"so long" to Anubis too!

00:18:51.222 --> 00:18:54.225
Oh, I would not be
so sure about that, Yuma!

00:18:54.225 --> 00:18:55.393
What?

00:18:55.393 --> 00:18:59.364
Whenever you destroy my spell or
trap card, Etheric Anubis can

00:18:59.364 --> 00:19:04.869
use one of its Overlay Units
to bring that card back.

00:19:04.869 --> 00:19:06.971
This spells certain
doom for you.

00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:08.973
Gaze into Mysterious Mirror!

00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:11.976
This powerful card has
a dreadful double effect.

00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:14.379
Not only does my
monster avoid destruction,

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.949
you take the damage
that I would have taken!

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:18.650
This is bad!

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.786
I activate Utopia's
special ability!

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:26.891
By using one Overlay Unit,
Utopia's stops its attack!

00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:28.760
Ah, you are more skilled
than you appear!

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.129
You got that right!
Thanks to Astral!

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.131
He took my dueling
to the next level!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:37.068
And I'll use his
training to beat you!

00:19:37.068 --> 00:19:37.802
I think not.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.370
Astral may have trained you,

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.906
but that will not be
enough to beat me,

00:19:41.906 --> 00:19:45.376
for I wield all of Astral
World's dueling skills

00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:47.345
in the palm of my hand!

00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:48.613
That's not good.

00:19:48.613 --> 00:19:51.316
You have made a drastic
understatement!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.184
For I wield the power to choose

00:19:53.184 --> 00:19:56.321
the very cards
I will draw!
Uh-oh...

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.389
I hope this isn't
what I think it is!

00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:01.326
This brilliant light
darkens your fate!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:05.596
Tremble before the power
of Shining Draw!

00:23:06.711 --> 00:23:10.047
