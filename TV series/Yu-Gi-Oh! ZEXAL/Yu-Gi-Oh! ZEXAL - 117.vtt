WEBVTT

00:00:00.993 --> 00:00:03.729
(Yuma)
Last time
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal"...

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.732
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:08.200
Quinton and I built it.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.703
It's an interdimensional
teleporter.

00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:13.072
We're going
to force open the portal

00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:14.206
to another dimension

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:15.741
and send you to Astral World.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.712
It could very well be
a one-way trip.

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:20.613
(gasps)

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:21.313
I don't care.

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:23.749
It's a risk
I'm totally willing to take!

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.251
Charge up the Astralite.

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.752
When it reaches
maximum strength,

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.755
we'll release all the stored
energy in a single burst

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.192
that'll create
a wormhole to Astral World!

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:35.127
The power's down!

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:37.062
So it can't charge!

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:38.964
We need to find more power now!

00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:42.735
Orbital, jack this thing
into <i>your</i> power core.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.738
(cackling)

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:46.739
(diabolical laughter)

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:49.742
I can't allow Yuma
to go to Astral World.

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:53.512
You Barians always show up
at the worst possible times.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.581
(growling)

00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:00.753
I'm going to love taking
the two of you down.

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:03.088
Let's duel!

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:04.323
I build the Overlay Network

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:09.728
and Xyz Summon Number 2:
Ninja Shadow Mosquito!

00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:13.599
I don't see it.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.733
I can assure you,

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.736
my mighty and magnificent
monster is here.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:19.738
And you'll soon
learn the hard way

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:22.608

This Barian says
he summoned his Number,

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:29.742
but I don't see anything!

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:33.278
Where's your monster Scritch?

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:37.750
(laughs)
My monster's... right here!

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.985
(laughs menacingly)

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:42.988
Maybe you boys can't see
my monster

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:45.758
because your eyes
have gone bad.

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:49.028
(groans) Something's wrong.

00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:50.429
I feel dizzy.

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.964
Kite, what's the matter?

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:54.733
I'm totally fine.
Why?

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.570
That bite's kicking in.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.738
Hey, needle nose!

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:00.739
Why are you foolin' around

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.742
playing hide and seek
with your Number?

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.278
Ahh!
I see it!

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:06.745
Huh?

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.348
I see it...
over there!

00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:10.282
Huh?

00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:14.019
Look.
Over his left shoulder!

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.557
Yes!
I see... something.

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:20.526
But it's so tiny!

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:21.994
Tiny and dangerous!

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:24.163
Don't let my Number's size
fool you.

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:26.198
Big things come
in small packages.

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:29.201
And once you witness my Number's
buzz-worthy abilities,

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.736
you'll wish you never met me!

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.505
I already wish I never met you.

00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.243
Since his Number
has zero attack points,

00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:41.747
it must have other surprises
in store for us.

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:47.753
Dyson Sphere, take out
Ninja Shadow Mosquito!

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.626
That'll show him!

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:56.095
Way to squash that skeeter!

00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:58.731
(laughs menacingly) Nice try.

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.568
But I activated one of
the buzz-worthy abilities

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:04.737
of my Shadow Mosquito!

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.039
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.742
Shadow Mosquito lives
to fight another day

00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:14.680
and my 8,000 life points
are safe and sound!

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.181
Enjoy them while you can,

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.183
because Kite's going
to take them down.

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:22.054
Tori, what's the charge
level on the teleporter?

00:04:22.054 --> 00:04:25.758
Uh, it's at... 72%.

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:26.625
(laughs)

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.962
That leaves me plenty of time
to destroy the teleporter.

00:04:29.962 --> 00:04:32.431
You'll never get
to Astral World!

00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:35.734
Button it, bug brain!
Hee-ya!

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:39.738
Oh!

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.740
What's wrong?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.374
Nothing.

00:04:42.374 --> 00:04:43.742
I keep telling you I'm fine.

00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:45.410
It's working.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.448
He's feeling my little sting.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:59.758
This Shadow Mosquito's
Overlay Units protect it
from being destroyed.

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.760
Time for a workaround.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.461
All right.

00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.164
It's been a while,
but I'm going hunting!

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:08.734
Galaxy-Eyes, take out
that Shadow Mosquito!

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:13.105
I activate Galaxy-Eyes Photon
Dragon's special ability,

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.741
banishing both of our monsters!

00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:18.744
Both monsters return to
the field later this turn.

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:21.747
But if your monster's
an Xyz Monster,

00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:25.217
all its Overlay
Units go bye-bye!

00:05:29.254 --> 00:05:29.721
(gasps)

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:33.759
Why isn't Galaxy-Eyes's
special ability activating?

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:36.061
You don't get it!

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:37.596
Galaxy-Eyes was poisoned

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:41.700
with a little something called
a Hallucination Counter.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.436
What is it and what does it do?

00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:45.137
(laughs menacingly)

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:50.375
When Ninja Shadow Mosquito
used an Overlay Unit
during Quinton's turn,

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.744
it didn't just keep
the two of us safe.

00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:55.147
It also put
a Hallucination Counter

00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:58.450
on Galaxy-Eyes's
Photon Dragon.

00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:04.523
My sneaky Ninja Shadow Mosquito
can't be destroyed by a monster

00:06:04.523 --> 00:06:08.227
that's been tagged with
a Hallucination Counter.

00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:11.563
So its special ability not
only keeps it safe,

00:06:11.563 --> 00:06:15.734
but the damage I would have
taken hits one of you instead.

00:06:15.734 --> 00:06:19.004
Now, which one should I choose?

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:23.342
I think I'll target that
oversized orb, Dyson Sphere!

00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:27.412
So say good-bye to your
life points, Quinton!

00:06:34.753 --> 00:06:36.021
(roaring)

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.222
I don't think so.

00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:39.358
I activate the trap
Micron Force!

00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:44.730
I cut Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon's
attack points in half.

00:06:46.732 --> 00:06:48.500
(roaring)

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.735
(screaming)

00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:51.403
Quinton!

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:01.179
Quinton, are you okay?
(groaning)

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:05.751
Why can't I focus?

00:07:07.152 --> 00:07:11.757
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:13.558
(laughs menacingly)

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.361
Yes, yes,
the poison is working.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:17.696
This is going to be great.

00:07:17.696 --> 00:07:21.500
You keep saying that
everything's okay, Kite.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.068
But something's up.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:26.338
For the last time,
Quinton, I'm fine.

00:07:26.338 --> 00:07:27.739
That's enough already.

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:32.744
Well, then you know
what you have to try
and do, don't you?

00:07:34.613 --> 00:07:37.549
Yeah, I know what.

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:38.750
I have to defeat you now!

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.453
What did you say?
Defeat me?

00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:44.423
Kite, you're supposed to take
the enemy down, not me.

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:47.459
Now get your head in the game!

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.127
I'm going to squash you

00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:52.564
like the annoying
little pest you are!

00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:53.732
Kite!

00:07:53.732 --> 00:07:56.001
Snap out of it!
You're all mixed up!

00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.172
Why would Kite start treating
Quinton like his enemy?

00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:02.107
(laughs menacingly)

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.710
My poison's making him
hallucinate.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.746
He doesn't know
friend from foe!

00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:11.550
This is like a dream come true!

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.753
I summon Mosquito Commando!

00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:18.623
(growling)

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.360
When Shadow Mosquito
is on my field,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.130
I can send Mosquito Commando
to the graveyard.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.600
That allows me to place
a Hallucination Counter

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.202
on one of your monsters.

00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:32.738
And I choose Dyson Sphere!

00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:43.648
Next, I activate the spell

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:47.352
Ninjitsu Art Of Mosquito
Combustion!

00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:50.756
If your monster has
a Hallucination Counter,

00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:54.226
you take 600 points of damage!

00:08:56.695 --> 00:08:59.998
I activate the trap
Elastic Space!

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.501
I'm not fond of getting hurt,

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:07.739
so this trap redirects all
that damage to you instead.

00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:13.278
That means
1,200 points of damage!

00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:15.747
(gasps)

00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:18.583
Quinton!

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:23.755
I'll save you, by playing
the trap card, Power Exchange!

00:09:23.755 --> 00:09:26.291
I won't let you hurt Quinton!

00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:29.728
By lowering my Photon Dragon's
attack points by 1,200,

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:32.597
all that damage
is reduced to the same chance

00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:35.100
you have of winning, zero.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.468
Why Kite?

00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:42.741
(laughs) That was close.

00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:43.742
Thank you, Kite.

00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:46.711
Kite lowered Galaxy-Eyes's
attack points

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.280
to save his enemy?

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.450
There's got to be
something wrong with him.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.287
You're right.
Something very wrong.

00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:56.021
Before the duel,

00:09:56.021 --> 00:10:00.192
I injected your friend
with a potent poison.

00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:01.426
You'll pay for that!

00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:03.728
I was with Kite before
you even got here

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:06.364
and I never saw you
inject him with anything.

00:10:06.364 --> 00:10:09.367
I never said it happened here.

00:10:09.367 --> 00:10:12.604
I hitched a ride with Kite
on his fancy flyer

00:10:12.604 --> 00:10:15.273
and while he was busy
blabbing about Astral,

00:10:15.273 --> 00:10:17.242
I pricked him with my poison.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.644
No way.
Sneaky skeet.

00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:23.748
Oh, dear, why thank you
for the compliment.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.751
We need Kite
and his Galaxy-Eyes

00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:29.754
if we're going to take
that Barian down.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.156
But if Kite's hallucinating,

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:33.725
there's no telling
what he's gonna do.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:35.360
I have got to figure out a way

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.130
to help him fight the poison.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.731
But how?

00:10:46.738 --> 00:10:48.707
(panting)

00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:50.642
Sir, you've got
to take a break.

00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:53.745
You've been dueling nonstop
for a whole week.

00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:54.546
Not yet.

00:10:54.546 --> 00:10:58.083
I activate the trap
Blasting the Ruins!

00:10:59.317 --> 00:11:01.486
Oh, no!
(screaming)

00:11:02.754 --> 00:11:04.422
(groaning)

00:11:04.756 --> 00:11:05.757
On your feet, Kite.

00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.759
The duel isn't over yet.

00:11:07.993 --> 00:11:09.494
You heard me!

00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:11.730
I told you to stand up!

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.330
Sir, please!

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.733
I know we're testing the limits
of his dueling skills,

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:17.135
but you've pushed him too far!

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.603
No.

00:11:18.603 --> 00:11:21.006
As long as he has
one life point left,

00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:25.410
he needs to keep dueling
no matter what it costs!

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.746
He can't take much more, sir.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.281
He won't last!

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:30.248
He must!

00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:31.183
If he's going to fail,

00:11:31.183 --> 00:11:33.585
it's better that he fail
right here and now.

00:11:33.585 --> 00:11:37.756
But if he can will himself
to get through this test,

00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:40.358
that power, that courage,

00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:44.095
will be burned into every
fiber of his being,

00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:48.066
and Kite will
become a true duelist.

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:50.435
Let's see if he can.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.739
There's only one thing to do.

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:57.742
I have to push Kite
to the extreme!

00:11:57.742 --> 00:12:03.014
Dyson Sphere, attack Kite's
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.053
Why is Quinton attacking Kite?

00:12:08.053 --> 00:12:09.154
You're not supposed
to go after him!

00:12:09.154 --> 00:12:13.291
This is gonna wipe out the rest
of Kite's life points!

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:21.132
Well, Quinton, looks like
you're seeing things, too.

00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:23.435
(laughs menacingly)

00:12:26.738 --> 00:12:30.308
Kite, this is the end!

00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:32.510
(gasps) (gasps)

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.314
I've got to get
through to him.

00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:40.585
You don't have
what it takes to win!

00:12:51.496 --> 00:12:52.998
(screaming)

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.134
That's more like it.

00:12:56.134 --> 00:12:57.736
Now let's duel.

00:13:09.147 --> 00:13:10.348
Kite, no!

00:13:10.348 --> 00:13:11.182
No!

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:14.252
One down, one to go.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.221
(laughs menacingly)

00:13:23.361 --> 00:13:24.429
What?!

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.731
How can you have
l-life points left?

00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:30.735
Because I activated
the trap card...

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:31.736
Prevent reborn!

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:32.737
When a monster is destroyed,

00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:37.208
Prevent Reborn lowers
the damage I take
by 1,000 points.

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:40.745
So this battle is far
from finished, you fool.

00:13:40.745 --> 00:13:44.049
Quinton, Kite's not
hallucinating anymore.

00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:45.750
But-but-but the poison!

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.751
Why isn't it still working?

00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:51.489
My inner duelist instincts
finally kicked into overdrive.

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:53.024
And that's much more powerful

00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:55.327
than your poison could ever be.

00:13:57.729 --> 00:14:01.566
It's not possible.
It can't be!

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.735
You thought
you could destroy my game

00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:05.737
with your cheap, sneaky,
cowardly tricks.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.508
So now I'm going to squash
you like the bug you are!

00:14:10.508 --> 00:14:13.511
I activate Prevent Reborn's
other effect!

00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:16.448
If you thought you saw
the last of my Dragon,

00:14:16.448 --> 00:14:17.282
you thought wrong,

00:14:17.282 --> 00:14:19.751
because Prevent Reborn
brings it back!

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.687
Good to see you,
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:23.655
(roaring)

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:28.259
Prevent Reborn's effect
only brings back
my monster to the field,

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.529
but not your
Hallucination Counter.

00:14:33.098 --> 00:14:37.569
Now all the traps
you've laid are useless.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.106
Yeah, Kite's brain
is back in the game!

00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:42.273
(sighs)

00:14:42.273 --> 00:14:46.344
I gotta admit you had me scared
there for a while, Kite.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:47.746
I never had a doubt.

00:14:47.746 --> 00:14:52.250
I was the one who trained
Kite how to be a duelist.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.754
So I know what
kind of strength he has.

00:14:56.654 --> 00:14:59.190
Quinton and Kite,
they're lucky.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.727
Those guys have a special bond
between them.

00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:05.597
A real strong one.

00:15:05.597 --> 00:15:08.733
Just like I had with Astral.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:11.736
Only mine was taken away
from me.

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:17.542
It.. just isn't fair.

00:15:17.742 --> 00:15:19.744
Kite, why don't you
show our friend here

00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:22.347
a thing or two about dueling.

00:15:22.347 --> 00:15:24.315
It would be my pleasure!

00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:29.421
Galaxy-Eyes, attack
Ninja Shadow Mosquito!

00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.622
When Galaxy-Eyes battles,

00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:34.759
it and the monster
it's attacking
are both banished.

00:15:36.995 --> 00:15:39.297
That means your
Shadow Ninja Mosquito

00:15:39.297 --> 00:15:41.699
loses all of its Overlay Units.

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:45.537
You will pay for that,
you little thief.

00:15:45.537 --> 00:15:47.472
Actually, I'll be
the one cashing in,

00:15:47.472 --> 00:15:48.239
you bug-eyed freak.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:52.043
See, once our monsters
return to the field
after the battle,

00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:56.080
for every Overlay Unit that
Ninja Shadow Mosquito shed,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.751
Galaxy-Eyes gains
500 attack points.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:05.256
A Shadow Mosquito that
doesn't have Overlay Units

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:09.060
is as helpless as a mosquito
that doesn't have its wings!

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.295
Not so fast.

00:16:10.295 --> 00:16:14.365
I activate the trap Ninjitsu
Art of Mosquito Repellent!

00:16:14.365 --> 00:16:18.736
By banishing all four
Mosquito monsters
in my graveyard,

00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:22.574
Ninja Shadow Mosquito
gains 1,000 attack points

00:16:22.574 --> 00:16:24.309
for every single one.

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:29.247
So now my Mosquito has
4,000 attack points!

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:34.752
(mosquitoes buzzing)

00:16:45.063 --> 00:16:48.533
I knew he'd have a trick
like this up his sleeve.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:55.006
I activate Mosquito Repellent's
additional effect!

00:16:55.006 --> 00:16:57.375
I can banish
Ninja Shadow Mosquito

00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:58.476
at the end of this turn

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:01.746
to deal you damage
equal to its attack points.

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:02.313
Can you count?

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.749
That's 4,000 points
skittering your way.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:09.754
When this turn's over,
it's over for you, too!

00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:18.730
When this turn's over,
it's over for you, too!

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:21.566
Quinton!
Kite!

00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:24.302
Yuma, stay where you are!

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.406
What do you think
you're doing, Yuma?

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:28.740
Helping you!

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.642
Don't forget why we're here.

00:17:30.642 --> 00:17:33.678
We're battling to send
you to Astral World.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.648
If we don't accomplish that,

00:17:36.648 --> 00:17:39.250
winning this duel
doesn't mean anything.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.619
There's no way
you can win this duel!

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:45.757
Thanks to my trap, when this
turn ends, it's all over.

00:17:45.757 --> 00:17:46.758
If you think otherwise,

00:17:46.758 --> 00:17:49.627
you must still
be hallucinating.

00:17:49.627 --> 00:17:50.395
(laughs menacingly)

00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:53.097
If anybody's hallucinating
here, it's you.

00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:56.734
But believe me, I'll bring
you to your Barian senses...

00:17:56.734 --> 00:17:58.269
right now!

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:02.740
I'm activating the spell card
Eternal Spell!

00:18:03.007 --> 00:18:04.676
This card gains the same effect

00:18:04.676 --> 00:18:07.579
as a spell in another
duelist's graveyard.

00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:12.450
I select Hologram Projection
in Quinton's graveyard!

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.752
Now I get to create
an exact duplicate

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:18.323
of my Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon.

00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:22.293
Now Kite's got
a double dose of Dragons!

00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:23.728
Nice try, Kite,

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.463
but that hologram is nothing

00:18:25.463 --> 00:18:28.333
but a shell
of its original self.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:29.000
It can't attack.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.270
It's easily destroyed and more
fragile than your ego.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.671
You're wrong, bug face.

00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:36.708
Luckily, I've got a little
surprise for you.

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:39.344
The trap card Power Analysis!

00:18:39.344 --> 00:18:42.313
My Dyson Sphere's attack
points become the same

00:18:42.313 --> 00:18:45.283
as a monster
on someone else's field.

00:18:45.283 --> 00:18:46.417
So why not go big?

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.386
I make Dyson Sphere's
attack points

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:52.757
the same as Kite's
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon.

00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:56.594
Next, I'll finish things off

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:57.729
with the trap
Paradox Synthesis.

00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:02.667
By sending my Dyson Sphere
and Kite's Hologram Projection
to the graveyard,

00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:05.737
I get to choose a monster to
get all their attack points.

00:19:05.737 --> 00:19:09.007
And guess which monster
I'm going to choose?

00:19:09.007 --> 00:19:10.074
No.
No!

00:19:10.074 --> 00:19:14.212
I tribute Dyson Sphere
and Hologram Projection.

00:19:14.212 --> 00:19:20.084
All 8,000 attack points
are added to the real
Galaxy-Eyes.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.153
(rumbling)

00:19:22.153 --> 00:19:24.222
(whimpering)

00:19:29.394 --> 00:19:34.532
It's got 12,000 attack points,
but it's too little, too late.

00:19:34.532 --> 00:19:37.035
Even if you raised it
to a bazillion attack points,

00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:40.438
you're still not allowed to
attack anymore this turn.

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:42.106
So it's impossible
for you to win!

00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:44.075
I wouldn't bet on that.

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:49.614
I activate the spell card
Miracle Galaxy!

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.218
This card lets
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon

00:19:54.218 --> 00:19:56.754
attack again this turn.

00:19:59.257 --> 00:20:00.324
(roaring)

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.193
Wait, please,
let's talk this over.

00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:05.630
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.635
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon,
attack Ninja Shadow Mosquito

00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:14.739
with Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:25.116
I can't believe
I've been exterminated!

00:20:28.986 --> 00:20:30.021
They did it!

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.756
You beat the bug, Kite!

00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:33.758
Nice work.
Very nice work.

00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:37.161
Lucky I had a good teacher.

00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:41.466
(Tori)
Hey guys, look.
The teleporter's fully charged!

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:44.602
(gasps, then screams)

00:20:47.672 --> 00:20:50.475
The portal should open
any second now.

00:20:50.475 --> 00:20:52.243
Hey, don't mess this up!

00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:55.113
Go find Astral
and bring him back, Yuma!

00:20:55.113 --> 00:20:56.481
Will do.

00:20:56.481 --> 00:20:57.749
Yuma!

00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:02.453
(gasps)

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.189
You know I'll come back,
right, Tori?

00:21:05.189 --> 00:21:08.760
Yes, if you promise
you will, Yuma.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.729
Yeah, I promise, Tori.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:22.039
I hope he can
keep that promise.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.741
I'm on my way, Astral.

00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:26.210
I'm gonna find you
and bring you back with me

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.578
no matter what it takes,

00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:30.748
because I'm feelin'
the flow!
