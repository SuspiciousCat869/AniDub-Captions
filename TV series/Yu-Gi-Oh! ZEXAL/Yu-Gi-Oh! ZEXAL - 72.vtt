00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:28.310
(Kite)
It's funny, but for all the
dueling these hands have done,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.944
I cannot remember why I ever
picked up a deck.

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:34.677
All my dueling lately
has been for Hart.

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:38.577
My whole reason for being was
to gather Numbers to save him.

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:41.777
But now that he's safe,
what's next for me?

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.210
Hey Kite, be careful...

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.277
Don't worry about
a thing, Hart.

00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:53.244
This time, there's
nothing we stand to lose.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:57.110
I only agreed to this duel
as a favor to Yuma.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.377
And besides, Hart...
he's never been a challenge.

00:01:06.877 --> 00:01:08.710
Be sure and watch
the duel.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.577
I promise to
put on a good show.

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:14.544
Good luck.

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:29.444
You know, Astral, I'm really
excited for our duel

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:30.744
against Kite!

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:31.744
Yes.

00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:33.144
As am I, Yuma.

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:36.210
I mean, Kite is like
a Super powerful duelist!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.210
The first time we dueled him,
he totally creamed us

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.344
with his Galaxy-Eyes!

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:43.010
Then after that, you and I
harnessed the power of Zexal

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.177
dueling him,

00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:46.577
but he still matched us
card for card.

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:49.410
And then we tag dueled
with him to rescue Hart.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.644
I've always been amazed
by his dueling.

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.510
And the more impressed I got
with his skill,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.477
the more beating him
became a goal I had to reach!

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.744
And today I finally think
I'm ready for him, Astral!

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:04.610
(Bronk)
Man, Yuma's super pumped
to take on Kite.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.310
Um, guys, am I the only one
who thinks Yuma's in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.777
way over his head?

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.810
No, Flip,
you're not alone.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.244
I think Yuma may be
outmatched this time!

00:03:13.344 --> 00:03:15.244
Gotta admit though,
he'll probably lose,

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:16.477
but it'll be a
great battle.

00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:17.644
C'mon now.

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:20.344
Am I the only one who has faith
Yuma will win?

00:03:20.444 --> 00:03:21.677
Nope.

00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:25.477
What's that?

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:27.010
Not sure...

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.510
Up there!

00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:42.744
What took you so long?

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:45.577
We've been waiting
for like forever.

00:03:45.677 --> 00:03:47.144
I'm here, aren't I?

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:53.410
Hope you two don't mind--
we want to watch this.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.877
This should be
quite a show!

00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:56.110
Oh, it will be.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.777
But I can tell you
how it'll end.

00:03:57.877 --> 00:04:00.110
Kite will crush Yuma flat.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.577
Hey Kite!

00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:04.044
I've been waitin' a long time
to take you on again.

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:08.110
Now we'll finally see
who the better duelist is!

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.477
Oh please.

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:11.144
The better duelist?

00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:13.110
Everyone here knows
that's me!

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.644
And now I'll be happy
to prove it to you!

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:17.610
'Kay.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.844
Let's see what you got!

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:25.544
Duel Disk go!

00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:27.310
Then let's do this!

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.577
Photon Transformation!

00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:41.510
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.144
<i>(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Vision Link
established.</i>

00:04:53.044 --> 00:04:54.710
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:05.728
Be safe.

00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:08.995
Go, Yu--
Yuma!

00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:11.661
You could win,
just don't mess up 'kay?

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:13.628
Aw, thanks,
I will!

00:05:13.728 --> 00:05:15.461
That goes for
you too, Astral!

00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:17.628
Stop looking so gloomy!

00:05:17.728 --> 00:05:20.195
Well, he always
looks like that.

00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.095
W-w-wait!
You can see Astral now?

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.695
Yeah, I don't know why,
but I just can!

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:31.395
My recent experiences in battle
have made me visible

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:33.028
to some individuals.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:35.228
A truly interesting
phenomenon.

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:36.828
Well, I was first.

00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:38.561
You're all just
copying me...

00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:39.628
Hey, you two.

00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:41.261
If you're done
gabbing with your fans,

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:42.828
let's get this duel
started.

00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:44.028
Happy to!

00:05:44.128 --> 00:05:46.795
Okay, I'll go first,
and get the show on the road

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:49.261
with this draw!

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.428
I summon Ganbara Knight
in attack mode!

00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:57.428
Whoa, what the what?

00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:00.095
Yuma's pulled some bonehead
dueling moves in the past,

00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:01.928
but this one might
just take the cake!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.361
Yes, in the end.

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:06.028
Summoning a monster with zero
attack points in attack mode

00:06:06.128 --> 00:06:08.128
is rather eccentric.

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:10.961
Ah who am I kidding,
it's totally nuts!

00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.295
Yuma...
Yes, Astral?

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:14.628
Good move.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:20.495
Now I activate the spell
Zerozerock!

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:21.928
Due to this card's effect,

00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:24.195
you can't attack monsters that
are in attack mode with

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:25.961
zero attack points!

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:31.361
I have seen that look
from Kite before

00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.395
and would not be surprised if he
summoned his Galaxy-Eyes next!

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.161
But with our spell, and Ganbara
Knight's special ability,

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:38.661
our defense is stronger.

00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:39.728
Yeah!

00:06:39.828 --> 00:06:41.561
I end my turn now, Kite!

00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:43.628
So let's see
what you can do.

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:48.128
I'm happy to show off what
I've got in store right now!

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:50.728
Since there's not a single
monster on my field,

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.761
I'm allowed
to summon this card!

00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:56.895
Photon thrasher!

00:06:56.995 --> 00:07:00.095
Next I summon
Photon Crusher!

00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:07.761
Photon monsters!

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.428
Well here it comes,
Astral.

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:14.195
Now I tribute my Level 4 Photon
Thrasher and Photon Crusher.

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:23.728
I Xyz summon the monster
more savage than a supernova!

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:27.761
With the cataclysmic force of
ten black holes put together!

00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.028
A cosmic scourge that vaporizes
anything in its path...

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:35.328
... the incredible
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:37.428
Whoa, Galaxy-Eyes!

00:07:37.528 --> 00:07:40.261
No matter how many times it's
played, it's always impressive!

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.828
I agree!

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.295
And now that my monster
is out,

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:46.095
it's time for it to sink
its teeth into yours!

00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:49.828
Galaxy-Eyes, attack
Ganbara Knight now!

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.328
I don't think so!

00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:52.995
Due to Zerozerock's effect,

00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:55.028
since Ganbara Knight
has zero attack points,

00:07:55.128 --> 00:07:56.428
you can't attack it!

00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:57.728
Don't be so sure.

00:07:57.828 --> 00:08:02.328
I can attack it when I activate
the spell Galaxy Burst!

00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:05.161
By cutting Galaxy-Eyes'
attack points in half,

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.461
two of your cards
lose their effects!

00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:13.295
And I choose Ganbara Knight
and Zerozerock!

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.561
My defense is gone?

00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:22.128
Very impressive.

00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:24.928
Not only did Kite manage to
summon out his monster,

00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:26.628
but he neutralized
our defense

00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:29.295
and he did them both
in the same turn!

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:33.295
Now Galaxy-Eyes attack
Ganbara Knight!

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:35.961
Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:51.628
He just lost 1,500
life points!

00:08:51.728 --> 00:08:54.261
Well, that settles it,
Yuma's in over his head.

00:08:57.261 --> 00:08:59.461
This'll teach you
to be so catty!

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:01.995
Yuma, you're not giving up,
are you?

00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:03.928
Nah...
he just got lucky...

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:08.428
Not bad.

00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:09.628
Not bad at all!

00:09:09.728 --> 00:09:13.261
But this duel
is far from over!

00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:14.795
What a fool.

00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.261
No matter how hopelessly
outmatched he is,

00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:18.961
Yuma always deludes himself

00:09:19.061 --> 00:09:22.428
into thinking he stands
a chance of winning.

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.895
Now I'm going to activate
the spell Battle Gravity!

00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:30.061
You won't like it, 'cause we
both have to battle

00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:33.195
with all our monsters
on each turn or take damage.

00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.861
So that means you'll be seeing
a lot of my Galaxy-Eyes!

00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:37.095
What?

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.895
Astral, does that mean what
I think it means?

00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:42.095
Yes, we must make
a dire choice.

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:45.495
We either fight Galaxy-Eyes or
our life points take a blow.

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:47.095
You got that right,
Astral.

00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:50.528
I place one card
facedown... and...

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:52.161
... end my turn!

00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:55.461
And since my turn is through,
Galaxy Burst's effect ends,

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.361
so Galaxy-Eyes'
attack points,

00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.561
as well as your Zerozerock's
effect return to normal.

00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:02.595
No matter what moves
you two make,

00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:04.528
I'll always be
three steps ahead.

00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:06.295
Yeah?
We'll see 'bout that!

00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:07.561
You don't scare me.

00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:09.928
This is what dueling's
all about.

00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:13.195
You make a move,
then I try to outdo it...

00:10:14.561 --> 00:10:16.795
Dueling's loads
of fun, huh?

00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:19.161
There's nothing
fun about it.

00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:21.361
It's a job,
a means to an end.

00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:23.561
No, you're looking
at it all wrong!

00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:25.461
See dueling for
what it really is!

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:26.928
A friendly competition!

00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:29.995
Maybe for you, but for me,
it was anything but that.

00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:31.495
You need a new perspective!

00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:33.295
Try looking at things
my way!

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:35.195
Just feel the flow!

00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.928
Trust in the cards.

00:10:39.028 --> 00:10:40.961
Not only is it
a great feeling,

00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:43.061
it'll really up
your game too!

00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:44.228
Sure will.

00:10:44.328 --> 00:10:46.095
In the end, he's right.
Completely.

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:47.428
Purr-fect!

00:10:47.528 --> 00:10:49.095
How true...

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:51.161
A unique perspective.

00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:52.895
Not a bad speech
there, kid.

00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:54.761
Feeling the flow
is what I live by.

00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:56.395
What matters
is having fun!

00:10:56.495 --> 00:10:58.161
Winning just
happens that way...

00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.661
And maybe you'll make
a new friend too...

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:02.361
What a total bunch
of nonsense!

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.295
Dueling's about
crushing your foe!

00:11:04.395 --> 00:11:07.361
And after that, taking
their Numbers.

00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:09.828
Defeating their Number Cards
is the only thing dueling

00:11:09.928 --> 00:11:11.928
has ever
meant to me, Yuma.

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:14.061
And I'll be beating
your best next.

00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:17.328
No way that's happening!

00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:19.428
'Cause I'm feeling
the flow!

00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:20.595
My turn!

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:22.828
I draw!

00:11:22.928 --> 00:11:25.261
And I'm summoning out
Goblindbergh!

00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:34.561
When Goblindbergh is
successfully summoned,

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:37.461
I can summon another
monster from my hand!

00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.295
And here it is,
Gagaga Magician!

00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:49.261
Next, I overlay my Goblindbergh
and Gagaga Magician!

00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.528
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network.

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:56.328
And Xyz Summon
Number 39: Utopia!

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:12.042
Aww yeah, Utopia!

00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:13.609
Just what he needed!

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:15.042
Win this!

00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:18.575
I knew it wouldn't be long
before he summoned his Number!

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:21.742
Now Utopia,
attack Galaxy-Eyes!

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.175
Yuma!

00:12:27.275 --> 00:12:30.709
Utopia has less attack points
than Galaxy Eyes!

00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:33.209
That's okay, 'cause
I use one Overlay Unit

00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:35.275
to stop Utopia's
attack!

00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.609
That was a huge
mistake, Yuma.

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:40.909
Don't you remember?

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:42.375
Due to Battle
Gravity's effect,

00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:43.775
if you don't fight
my Galaxy Eyes,

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:45.975
you take 1,000
points of damage!

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:49.275
Yuma...
No, 'cause I'm not
through...

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:52.675
I activate the
spell Flash Effect!

00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:54.342
Excellent!

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:56.542
Since Utopia used
its special ability,

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:58.909
it not only gains 800
attack points,

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:01.909
but all monsters lose their
special abilities.

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:06.409
What?
Is this for real?

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:07.709
Oh yeah!

00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:11.575
That means Utopia powers up
to 3300 attack points!

00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:15.109
And Utopia and Galaxy Eyes
lose their special abilities!

00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:22.175
Excellent, Utopia's attack on
Galaxy-Eyes can continue.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.609
However this time,
with more attack points!
That's right!

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:28.609
And Utopia's added power will
allow us to slay that Dragon.

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:31.942
Galaxy-Eyes is one monster
I will definitely not miss.

00:13:33.409 --> 00:13:34.275
And now!

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:38.475
Utopia,
attack Galaxy-Eyes!

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:39.942
Don't think so!

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:42.609
I activate the trap
Battle Simulation!

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.775
Now both our monsters'
attack points are cut in half!

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.742
And neither can be
destroyed in battle!

00:13:54.609 --> 00:13:55.942
Nicely done!
I'll say.

00:13:56.042 --> 00:13:58.309
I thought Yuma had got
the upper hand this time.

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:01.142
Bet he didn't expect
that move.
The twerp's toast!

00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:02.775
One more thing...

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.409
Now what?
This!

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:07.209
I activate the spell
Double Bind!

00:14:09.409 --> 00:14:12.109
And this card spells double
the trouble for you,

00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:14.842
because it doubles
Utopia's attack points!

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:17.375
Bet you've begun to think
about how to handle your loss,

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:18.709
huh, Kite?

00:14:18.809 --> 00:14:20.342
I don't lose.

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:21.509
(Astral)
Are you certain?

00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:23.309
Battle Simulation's
effect ends

00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:25.509
and Galaxy-Eyes
can be destroyed!

00:14:25.609 --> 00:14:27.875
Big deal--
Bring it on, Yuma!

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.909
Let 'em have it,
Utopia!

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:32.875
Attack with
Rising Sun Slash!

00:14:47.309 --> 00:14:50.275
Now the effects of
all traps and spells end

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:52.609
and Utopia's attack points
and special abilities

00:14:52.709 --> 00:14:55.142
return to normal.

00:14:55.242 --> 00:15:00.675
Now I'll just place one card
facedown and then end my turn!

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.209
Ahh!

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:04.942
Yes!

00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:08.875
That wasn't just awesome!
It was awesomely awesome!

00:15:12.675 --> 00:15:13.909
Did you guys see that?

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:15.575
Give it up for this guy!

00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:17.075
Hey, why aren't you guys
screaming at the top

00:15:17.175 --> 00:15:18.275
of your lungs like me?

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.442
(Kite)
He really is
quite remarkable.

00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:26.509
No matter how many times he's
knocked to the floor...

00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:30.742
he always jumps right up again
and gets back to dueling...

00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:34.475
... even though it usually means
falling down all over again.

00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:37.542
I, on the other hand,
am nothing like Yuma.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:44.209
Oh dear.

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:52.242
Yuma and Astral...

00:15:52.342 --> 00:15:53.409
Yes, Kite?

00:15:57.642 --> 00:15:59.042
What's going on?

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:05.042
I give up.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:07.342
You win.

00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:09.475
I just can't go on.

00:16:09.575 --> 00:16:11.342
This duel is now over.

00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.356
I can't go on.

00:16:20.456 --> 00:16:22.156
This duel is over.

00:16:22.256 --> 00:16:24.290
Kite, what are you
talking about?

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.956
What do you mean
you can't go on?

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.323
No, Kite, don't do this!

00:16:33.423 --> 00:16:35.523
This isn't a joke, is it?

00:16:35.623 --> 00:16:37.190
'Cause I'm not laughing!

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.656
It's not, Yuma.

00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:42.790
I've realized that I have
no reason to go on dueling.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.090
But, Kite...

00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:51.523
You see, up until now, I dueled
to gather all the Number Cards

00:16:51.623 --> 00:16:53.656
in order to save Hart.

00:16:53.756 --> 00:16:56.623
Now that Hart is okay, I don't
need to collect Number Cards.

00:16:56.723 --> 00:16:58.123
I have been so used
to beating Numbers,

00:16:58.223 --> 00:16:59.956
that that's what
I thought I wanted.

00:17:00.056 --> 00:17:03.156
But I see now that defeating
your Utopia is pointless.

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.356
I forfeit.

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.456
No way...

00:17:07.056 --> 00:17:08.256
You hear me?

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:10.556
I won't accept you just
quitting this duel!

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:12.190
Because I refuse
to believe that this is

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.056
what you really want!

00:17:14.156 --> 00:17:15.190
It is.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.990
Dueling lacks
purpose for me.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.423
Kite, no...

00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:24.190
Listen, Kite,
you are wrong.

00:17:25.923 --> 00:17:28.056
You see, dueling
does have a purpose,

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:30.023
though you cannot see it.

00:17:30.123 --> 00:17:31.990
I used to think
the only purpose to dueling

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.323
was regaining my memories,

00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:37.356
but I would soon learn that
I was very wrong!

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:40.090
You see, the more
I dueled alongside Yuma,

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.690
the more I realized
dueling's true purpose.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.390
True purpose?

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.323
Yes, it is friendship.

00:17:47.423 --> 00:17:48.856
The more you duel
with someone,

00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:50.890
the deeper your
bonds grow together.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.356
As was the case with Yuma.

00:17:52.456 --> 00:17:55.090
Our hearts and minds
grew closer.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.890
We became friends...

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.590
because we gained
a greater understanding

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.156
of one another.

00:18:00.256 --> 00:18:02.456
Dueling has done
the same with you.

00:18:02.556 --> 00:18:04.856
It has made you my friend.

00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:09.490
You see, memories are only
reminders of the past,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.756
but friendships carry
you into the future.

00:18:12.856 --> 00:18:15.056
Please understand, Kite.

00:18:15.156 --> 00:18:17.490
You do not need to
live in the past.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.090
Live instead
for the future!

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.790
I...

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.123
Kite, he's right!

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:27.290
Be just like me
and high-five the sky!

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:37.356
Well, not just like me,
but you get the idea, right?

00:18:37.456 --> 00:18:38.390
Yuma...

00:18:39.923 --> 00:18:42.956
I guess what my good friend
Astral is getting at is:

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.390
Dueling rocks,
on so many levels!

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.756
Oh, and the best part is,
me and my friends

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:50.056
never have to worry about
grades or report cards

00:18:50.156 --> 00:18:51.590
on the duel field!

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.090
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.823
I've seen that look before

00:19:03.923 --> 00:19:05.990
and Kite's definitely
not giving up!

00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:13.856
I've never had
many friends.

00:19:13.956 --> 00:19:16.790
And I don't know
if any are in my future...

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.890
But it sounds like dueling opens
up a world of possibilities,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.423
and I'd be a fool
to ignore that.

00:19:22.523 --> 00:19:23.623
Sounds good...

00:19:23.723 --> 00:19:26.023
That's just what
I wanted to hear.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.523
(Vetrix)
Isn't that nice?

00:19:27.623 --> 00:19:31.090
It sounds like Kite has a
renewed interest in dueling.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.423
And it's all thanks to Yuma.

00:19:33.523 --> 00:19:36.090
He has a lot in common
with his father.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.156
They both see
the value of friendship.

00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:41.890
Maybe they are
on to something...

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.890
Quinton, Quattro, Trey!

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.356
We're off!

00:19:47.723 --> 00:19:49.756
Yes, coming, father.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.356
Yuma, thank you
for everything.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.690
You ready to get beat?

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.256
You'll regret those words.

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:10.776
See, you winning
is not in the cards!
