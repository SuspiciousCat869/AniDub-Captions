WEBVTT

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.389
That was a bad break
for Erazor.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:06.690
He got so close!

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.393
He was just about
to beat Yuma Tsukumo

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:11.829
when... (groans)

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.866
But we'll crush that kid
next time for sure, right?

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.235
You're all talk.

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:22.840
This time, I want action!

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.874
A... absolutely!

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:25.376
Totally understood, Vector!

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.712
This next guy'll get
the job done, guaranteed.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:30.748
He's a beast
on and off the field.

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:33.417
He may have a few
very minor authority issues

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:34.418
which might be a...

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.888
Will he beat Yuma or not?

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.659
Oh, he will, Vector.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.227
Oh, he will!

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:46.397
The guy's a one-man
sting operation.

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:48.165
He can stop anybody!

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:49.400
Is that so?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.402
If your man's so powerful,

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.037
perhaps we should have him

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:56.307
take Yuma's friends
down first.

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:59.410
Starting with
the treacherous one,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.412
Reginald Kastle.

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.814
Send your man on a Shark hunt

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:07.117
and make sure
he hooks his Number, too.

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:11.355
Don't disappoint me
again, Heartland.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:14.158
I won't, sir.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.398
(Shark's voice) <i>That duel I had in</i>
<i>the underwater ruins...</i>

00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:24.001
<i>it stirred upall those painful memories</i>

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.404
<i>of me and Riofrom the past.</i>

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:30.040

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.227
<i>But... that battlewith Vector.</i>

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.396

Now don't be shy, Trey.

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.031
I made plenty for
everyone, so dig in.

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.666
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:06.070
I really appreciate
you letting me stay here.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.372
Why are you dressed like
you're going to school?

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:10.407
Oh, I didn't have
a change of clothes,

00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:12.409
so Yuma's letting me
wear this today.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.844
We just gotta work on the hair,

00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:17.381
and the teachers'll
never know it's not me.

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:21.719
You've certainly
cheered up my grandson.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.787
He's been rather
gloomy lately.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.389
I can't remember the last time

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.059
I saw Yuma smiling while
he was eating breakfast.

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.396
How could anybody
eat your food and not smile?

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:35.399
Yeah.

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.135
Hey, I just thought
of a really funny idea!

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.405
Astral, you ought to
take a bite and see-

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:46.410
Oh, I forgot
that Astral's gone.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:49.947
My bad.

00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:55.085
You must've inherited
forgetfulness from me.

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:56.220
Uhh, yeah.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.756
Still, we can't
waste too much time

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.257
sitting around eating.

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:01.125
We gotta be ready,

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.161
'cause I know Heartland" 's
gonna try something.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.296
I think we should
let Kite and Shark

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:09.133
know about what's going on.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:10.401
I can't get in touch with Kite,

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:13.103
because he's
ignoring me as usual.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.938
And Shark can't help now.

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:18.709
He stays at the hospital
with Rio all the time.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.644
Guys, why don't
we go over there

00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:23.347
and see how
they're both doing?

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:27.851
Oh, no, it's starting to rain!

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:32.256
It's cool, just dodge
the drops like me!

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:40.097
(voice on intercom) <i>Dr. Bloom,</i>
<i>please come to ICU 3...</i>

00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:44.401
<i>Dr. Bloom to ICU 3, please.</i>

00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:48.405
Oh, excuse me, sir.

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:50.974
This area's for
hospital personnel only.

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:53.210
If you need to get
to the other wing,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.244
you... oh, now,

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.413
how did all this water
get on the floor?

00:04:56.413 --> 00:04:58.348
Sir, you need
to leave here right now,

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:01.418
or I'm going to call security.

00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:06.023
I'm not going anywhere, nurse.

00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:09.092
But you are!

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:11.395
(nurse screams)

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:16.400
You're going to sleep
for a long, long time.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.009
(chuckling)

00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.154
Hey, what're you doing?

00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:44.795
<i>(monitors beep)</i>

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:48.165
Get away from her
right now, or else!

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:50.934
What did you do
to Shark's sister?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:54.071
Well, well...
it's Yuma Tsukumo.

00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.939
How'd you know my name?

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.041
(gasps) Are you a Barian?

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.245
After I get rid
of your friend, Shark...

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:04.348
I'm coming for you.

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.417
Hey, where'd he go?

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.654
Yuma...
Shark's in danger.

00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:12.022
You're right.

00:06:12.022 --> 00:06:13.257
We gotta warn him!

00:06:13.257 --> 00:06:16.360
Before it's too late!

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.202
It just keeps ringing.

00:06:28.202 --> 00:06:29.102
No answer!

00:06:29.102 --> 00:06:30.938
Yuma, we'd better split up

00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:32.372
and try to find him.

00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:33.073
Right.

00:06:33.073 --> 00:06:34.708
I'll go get Bronk
and the others

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:35.642
to look for him, too!

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:37.711
And I'll call my brothers.

00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:40.714
Why?
What's wrong, Trey?

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.387
(Shark's voice)
<i>It's just like that day.</i>

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:50.991
<i>It was raining then, too.</i>

00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:52.092
(chuckling)

00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:53.293
Reginald?
Huh?

00:06:53.293 --> 00:06:55.696
When we get home,
teach me about

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:56.697
dueling again, okay?

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.268
Okay, but only if
you promise not to cry.

00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:03.237
I don't cry!

00:07:03.237 --> 00:07:04.271
Yes, you do.

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:05.706
No, I don't.
Do, too.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:07.207
Do not!
Do, too!

00:07:07.207 --> 00:07:07.708
Do not!

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.243
I thought you two told me

00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:11.011
you were going to fall asleep.

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.980
(horn honking) Aah!

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.916
(both) Aah!

00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:23.657
(doctor)
Nurse, keep
an eye on them.

00:07:23.657 --> 00:07:25.592
Tell me if their
condition changes.

00:07:25.592 --> 00:07:26.560
(nurse) Yes, doctor.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.229
I'll be sure
to monitor them closely.

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.398
Poor kids.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.536
<i>Nothing was ever</i>
<i>the same after that day.</i>

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:39.306
<i>I had to grow up fast.</i>

00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:42.476
<i>For me and for Rio.</i>

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.712
He's not at his house
or at school.

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:49.683
And he's still not
answering his phone.

00:07:49.683 --> 00:07:51.451
How could he just disappear

00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:53.153
with his sister
in the hospital?

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:57.391
If Astral were here,
I bet he'd know what to do.

00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.227
I miss him.

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:16.143
<i>Feels weird to be back.</i>

00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:17.678
<i>It looks the same.</i>

00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:22.449
<i>Rio and I never came home</i>
<i>after the accident.</i>

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:24.985
<i>A lot of memories here.</i>

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:29.222
<i>A lot of memories.</i>

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:08.161
(younger Shark)
<i>Give it back, Rio!</i>

00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.631
<i>That's a special card Dad gave me!</i>

00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:12.366
No way!

00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:14.601
I saw it first, Reginald!

00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:16.703
Give it to me!

00:09:18.438 --> 00:09:22.075
(Rio giggling)

00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:24.311
Give it back!

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:31.351
Rio!
(Rio gasps)

00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:33.353
Look out!

00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:38.692
(Rio crying)

00:09:38.692 --> 00:09:41.561
(Dad) Reginald!

00:09:41.561 --> 00:09:44.097
Calm down, it's all right.

00:09:44.097 --> 00:09:47.067
Oh, dear!

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:50.103
Oh, my sweet girl, don't cry.

00:09:50.103 --> 00:09:52.072
It's all right.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:53.306
Don't be mad,

00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:54.641
but I think
the card you gave me

00:09:54.641 --> 00:09:56.610
got really messed up...
I'm sorry.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.479
Reginald, of course
I'm not angry.

00:09:59.479 --> 00:10:03.250
Dear, we need
to take care of that cut.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.652
<i>All those things</i>
<i>that happened are real.</i>

00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:06.586
<i>I know it.</i>

00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:08.688
<i>Because I still have that scar.</i>

00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:11.691
<i>And that's</i>
<i>all the proof I need.</i>

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:17.697
What was I thinking?

00:10:17.697 --> 00:10:19.933
There's no way
I could be a Barian.

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:23.603
(distant chuckling)

00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:25.705
Who's there?

00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:30.710
So you're Reginald Kastle.

00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:32.112
(eyes hum)

00:10:32.112 --> 00:10:35.682
That's right!
Who's asking?

00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:42.622
You won't get away!

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:49.596
Why, you dirty...

00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:51.431
Zip the lip, you little punk!

00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:53.333
Or I'm going
to zip it for you!

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:54.568
I've been sent to reel you in,

00:10:54.568 --> 00:10:57.704
and I'm not leaving
empty-handed.

00:10:57.704 --> 00:10:59.706
What are you talking about?

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.541
Show some respect,
you lowly human!

00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:04.377
Don't you realize
you're speaking to a Barian?

00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:05.712
Oh, so you're a Barian?

00:11:05.712 --> 00:11:09.015
You think you're such
a great duelist, don't you?

00:11:09.015 --> 00:11:10.383
Well, when I get
through with you,

00:11:10.383 --> 00:11:13.220
everyone will know
that the all-mighty Shark

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.689
is a guppy compared
to Chironex!

00:11:15.922 --> 00:11:18.225
I can beat...
(groans)

00:11:18.225 --> 00:11:21.595
What'd you do?
What'd you put in me?

00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:25.398
Hmm. Somehow,
you look familiar.

00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:26.366
Oh, well.

00:11:26.366 --> 00:11:29.469
It looks like
my poison is taking effect.

00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:30.604
Your poison?

00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:33.173
That's right,
and it won't be very long

00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:35.609
until it works
its magic on you.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:36.610
So if you want to duel,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.678
we'd better
get started right away.

00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:41.715
What? Why would I waste
my time dueling you?

00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:44.151
I don't think dueling
would be a waste of time

00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:45.685
if it keeps
your sister from visiting

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:49.055
Davy Jones' locker,
do you, Shark?

00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:50.023
Rio?

00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:51.124
You got to her, too?

00:11:51.124 --> 00:11:52.692
(Rio whimpers)
Mm-hmm.

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:53.693
My bad!

00:11:53.693 --> 00:11:55.061
But, luckily, there's a way

00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:58.498
her big, strong brother
Shark can save her.

00:11:58.498 --> 00:12:01.701
All you have to do
is defeat me in a duel.

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:04.337
Of course,
if you don't want to,

00:12:04.337 --> 00:12:05.705
you don't have to.

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:07.507
All right, Chironex!

00:12:07.507 --> 00:12:09.709
(male voice) Hang on!

00:12:14.714 --> 00:12:16.316
I don't believe it.

00:12:16.316 --> 00:12:17.417
How's it going?

00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:20.420
Long time no duel, Reginald!

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.591
Hope you didn't
miss me too much!

00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:26.693
Quattro!

00:12:29.162 --> 00:12:30.397
My, my.

00:12:30.397 --> 00:12:32.132
How nice of you to drop by.

00:12:32.132 --> 00:12:34.534
Why are you here, Quattro?

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:36.703
My brother Trey
asked me to find you.

00:12:36.703 --> 00:12:38.238
He thought you
might be in trouble,

00:12:38.238 --> 00:12:40.707
and it turns out he was right.

00:12:40.707 --> 00:12:43.243
Well, I don't want
or need your help!

00:12:43.243 --> 00:12:46.713
Believe me,
I don't care about you.

00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:50.417
It's your sister
I'm worried about.

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:51.685
Rio?

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:54.054
(Rio whimpers)

00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:57.691
Rio...

00:12:57.691 --> 00:12:59.326
Right now,
your sister's fighting

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:01.561
with every breath she's got.

00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:02.963
She's already suffered enough,

00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:05.632
thanks to me and my family.

00:13:05.632 --> 00:13:07.400
That's why I'm going
to dazzle you with

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.703
my brilliant dueling
skills and defeat him!

00:13:09.936 --> 00:13:12.706
You just stay back,
watch, and learn.

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:13.707
Get lost!

00:13:13.707 --> 00:13:16.509
I'm dueling him!

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.112
You both underestimate me!

00:13:19.112 --> 00:13:21.014
You think you're so great?

00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:23.283
You're not half
the duelist I am!

00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:27.087
I'll duel you both
at once and prove it!

00:13:27.087 --> 00:13:28.688
Well, you heard him.

00:13:28.688 --> 00:13:32.525
Think we should take
this guy up on his offer?

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.694
All right.

00:13:34.694 --> 00:13:37.130
Let's do it for Rio!

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.031
Good.

00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:39.499
A two against one duel.

00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:42.469
I only have
one little condition.

00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:43.470
What's that?

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.506
I'm sure you won't mind
evening things up a bit,

00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:48.708
seeing as I'm going
to be outmanned.

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.711
I'll start the duel
with 8,000 life points,

00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:54.481
and you each get
2,000 life points.

00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:56.449
If you were so great,
you wouldn't need

00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:57.450
an advantage, would you?

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.953
However, it'll keep
things interesting.

00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:03.256
You think you're
so clever, don't you?

00:14:03.256 --> 00:14:04.591
But just you wait.

00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:06.693
We'll see how clever you are

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:09.095
when my poison is coursing

00:14:09.095 --> 00:14:11.298
through your veins.

00:14:11.298 --> 00:14:15.068
I knew there was
something fishy about you.

00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:19.706
(Shark) Duel Disk, locked!

00:14:28.982 --> 00:14:31.584
Duel Gazer, loaded!

00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:34.688
(beeping)

00:14:34.688 --> 00:14:36.690
Hah!

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.393
(female voice)
Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.

00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:42.679
(all) Let's duel!

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:46.631
He's not here!

00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:48.834
We gotta find Shark
and tell him about Rio.

00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:52.404
Yuma, I just got
a message from my brother!

00:14:52.404 --> 00:14:54.506
And the news isn't good.

00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:57.309
I'll go first!

00:14:57.309 --> 00:14:58.477
I draw!

00:14:58.477 --> 00:15:03.081
<i>I'm gonna show this guy</i>
<i>no one messes with my family!</i>

00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:07.118
I'm summoning Saber Shark!

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:14.493
Time to see if
you've got what it takes

00:15:14.493 --> 00:15:15.560
to swim with the sharks!

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.664
So I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:21.399
I was expecting a move with

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.767
a little more bite to it.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:24.736
Don't worry, I'll show my teeth

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.838
when the time's right.

00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:30.075
Hah, wait and see...

00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:35.113
Well, I have to make sure
that doesn't happen!

00:15:37.349 --> 00:15:40.819
I summon Stinging Jellyfish!

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:49.761
That lets me summon another
monster from the deep...

00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.664
Silent Sea Nettle!

00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:01.673
Let's see how
you hotshots handle this.

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:04.109
Watch closely, boys.

00:16:04.109 --> 00:16:07.245
I overlay Level 4
Stinging Jellyfish

00:16:07.245 --> 00:16:09.548
and Silent Sea Nettle!

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:11.149
With these two monsters,

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:13.218
I build the Overlay Network

00:16:13.218 --> 00:16:15.520
and XYZ Summon!

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.355
(thunder crashes)

00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:19.624
Appear, Number 4,

00:16:19.624 --> 00:16:22.694
Stealth Kragen!

00:16:40.512 --> 00:16:41.846
The nerve of this guy!

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:43.815
Number 4's my special number!

00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:45.817
My name ain't Quattro
for nothing!

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.786
And it turns out
Number 4's something

00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:49.754
from the seafood section?

00:16:49.754 --> 00:16:50.689
Number 4's no joke!

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:54.225
Jellyfish are one of the most
dangerous creatures in the sea!

00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:56.194
And once you feel
Stealth Kragen's

00:16:56.194 --> 00:16:58.830
poison sting,
you won't be laughing!

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.832
(groaning) (chuckling)

00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:02.634
You're in bad shape.

00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:04.502
I told you you should let me

00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:06.338
do the dueling.

00:17:06.338 --> 00:17:06.838
He's right.

00:17:07.072 --> 00:17:10.742
It 's clear you can" 't
save your sister.

00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:12.844
I can still beat you!

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:14.579
Oh, yeah?

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.181
We'll see about that!

00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:19.484
I activate Stealth Kragen's
special ability!

00:17:19.484 --> 00:17:21.820
On each of our turns,
I can destroy

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.356
one Water monster on the field.

00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:27.425
I choose Saber Shark!

00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:33.198
You also take damage
equal to Saber Shark's

00:17:33.198 --> 00:17:34.733
attack points!

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:36.835
Venom Blast!

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.139
Aah...

00:17:46.778 --> 00:17:51.416
It'll take more than that
to beat us, right, Shark?

00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.450
A lot more.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.052
Well, I have plenty more...

00:17:54.052 --> 00:17:57.822
but for now I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:17:57.822 --> 00:17:59.557
Then it's my move!

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:01.059
Time for you to get schooled,

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.428
you spineless jellyfish!

00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:05.363
(battle-cry)

00:18:05.363 --> 00:18:08.299
I summon
Gimmick Puppet Des Troy!

00:18:09.267 --> 00:18:13.271
Next I activate the spell
Card of Puppets!

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:17.442
It destroys
my Gimmick Puppet Des Troy.

00:18:18.677 --> 00:18:22.147
By destroying
my Gimmick Puppet,

00:18:22.147 --> 00:18:24.582
I get to draw one card!

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:26.518
And I'm not done yet!

00:18:26.518 --> 00:18:27.819
Not by a long shot.

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:29.721
You see, when
Des Troy is destroyed,

00:18:29.721 --> 00:18:31.823
I get to summon
two Gimmick Puppets

00:18:32.057 --> 00:18:35.160
to take its place!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.429
Give a warm welcome to...

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:39.497
Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:41.466
and Dreary Doll!

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:44.269
I overlay Level 8
Twilight Joker

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:46.204
and Dreary Doll!

00:18:46.204 --> 00:18:49.808
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:52.644
I XYZ Summon Number 15!

00:18:52.644 --> 00:18:56.715
Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder!

00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:15.600
There's Shark!

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:17.836
(Shark groans)

00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:20.371
Oh, no...
he's been poisoned too!

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.841
And now, I activate my Number's

00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:23.842
special ability!

00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:25.610
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:30.415
Giant Grinder destroys
your Stealth Kragen.

00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:49.801
Now you take damage
equal to all of your

00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:51.836
Stealth Kragen's
attack points!

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:52.837
(Kurage growls)

00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:56.841
So you're losing
1,900 Life Points!

00:19:56.841 --> 00:19:58.843
This should be a blast!

00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:01.846
Destruction Cannon!

00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:06.818
Yeah!

00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:09.721
That's what you get when
you battle with my brother!

00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:11.623
I bet that fall you just took

00:20:11.623 --> 00:20:13.057
would've hurt a whole lot more

00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:15.260
if you had a backbone.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.830
(Kurage chuckles)

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.832
No backbone, eh?

00:20:20.832 --> 00:20:23.334
You've got a big mouth, boy!

00:20:23.334 --> 00:20:26.838
But as you can see,
I've got two big ways

00:20:26.838 --> 00:20:27.839
to shut it now!

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.774
What?
(Shark groans)

00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:33.478
How did he get two monsters?

00:20:33.478 --> 00:20:35.413
What's going on here?

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:37.549
You gutless jellyfish...

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:40.819
You think
I'm a gutless jellyfish?

00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:44.255
(Kurage chuckles)

00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:45.824
Well, you'll both
need more than guts

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:49.828
if you want to survive
what these two have in store!

00:20:49.828 --> 00:20:53.832
(Kurage cackles)

00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:07.498
