WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.781
(Yuma)
Last time
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.183
No way!
It can't be true!

00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:09.753
Quattro and Bronk and the others
are gone?

00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:13.257
Unless we finish the Barians
once and for all,

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:15.926
Quattro and the others
fought for nothing.

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:18.662
Instead of fighting
the seven Barian Emperors,

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:22.933
let us eliminate the source
and defeat Don Thousand instead.

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.769
Then, let's go to Barian World
and beat him!

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.403
Come on, Orbital.

00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:28.472
I've got more important
things to do

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:29.673
than run around with you.

00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:33.944
But, Kite, what could be
more important than this?

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:34.945
Kite!

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:39.583
Trey, I'm sorry we had to
leave Yuma the way we did.

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.318
There was no other way,
Quinton.

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:45.456
We knew the Barians
were minutes away.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:46.924
And if Yuma knew about that,

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.460
he would have insisted
on battling them.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.927
But this way,

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:53.297
he'll carry out his mission
to take on Don Thousand instead.

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:56.934
He and Astral are the only ones
who can end the battle.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.302
We'll be the decoys

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:00.304
and draw the Barians to us
instead.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:03.841
You two pests
know where Yuma and Kite are,

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.442
and I want to know right now.

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:06.944
(Quinton) Not a chance, Mizar.

00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:09.913
We'll never tell you anything!

I will crush the both of you...

00:02:16.914 --> 00:02:21.919
with my Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.853
(dragon roars)

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:28.292
Kite likes to battle
with a Galaxy-Eyes Dragon, too.

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:29.927
That's bad news for you.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.861
And why is that?

00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.933
Because I taught Kite everything
he knows about Galaxy-Eyes.

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:36.934
Ah.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:41.271
So, Mizar, you've messed
with the wrong duelist!

00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:41.939
I doubt it.

00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:45.309
And I will prove that
by taking you both on together!

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.812
Your ego is about to experience
a rude awakening.

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:52.149
You picked the wrong family
to mess with, Mizar!

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.817
Enough talk.

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:56.587
Let us have some fun!

00:02:56.587 --> 00:03:00.157
Go, Barian Battle Morph!

00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:05.929
All right.
Ready, Trey?

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.232
Yeah, totally!

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.936
Duel Disk set.

00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:20.577
Aha!

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.485
Let's duel.
Let's duel.

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:31.288
(Girag) What?

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:34.925
You want to get Nash
back to Barian World?

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:35.859
That's right.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.930
Our fearless leader
needs to rule, not duel.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.865
You sure about that?

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:42.933
Just do it.

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:45.936
Alito, keep searching for Yuma.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:46.870
Hey!

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.672
Who made you boss, Vector?

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:49.940
What makes you think
Girag and I

00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:52.609
should have to follow
your orders?

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.210
You owe me.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.945
Remember when you lost
to the humans?

00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:57.581
I was the one
who woke you up from your nap.

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.918
Hey!
I don't like your attitude!

00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:01.919
Is that so?

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.186
Well, maybe
you'll like it better

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:06.924
after a friend of mine
has a word with you.

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:08.926
Say hello to Don Thousand!

00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:11.929
D-D-Did you say
D-D-Don Thousand?

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:12.863
(laughing evilly)

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:14.932
(whimpers) (whimpers)

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:19.536
It's... really... him!

00:04:19.536 --> 00:04:22.572
You are right
to quiver with dread!

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:23.373
My untold power

00:04:23.373 --> 00:04:26.310
can annihilate you
in the bat of an eye.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.577
You're insane, Vector!

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:30.314
You never should've brought
Don Thousand back!

00:04:30.314 --> 00:04:33.283
He'll destroy everything,
including us!

00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:36.920
(groaning)

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.792
This makes things a lot simpler
for everybody!

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:44.861
You'll do exactly
what I tell you to.

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.197
(laughs)

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:49.700
(Kari)
Let me get this straight.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.269
Yuma went to a place
called Barian World

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:53.937
to save the galaxy?

00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:55.205
That's right.

00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:57.674
But he said he'll be back
for breakfast!

00:04:57.674 --> 00:04:59.576
I hope he can keep his word.

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:00.577
(whimpers)

00:05:00.577 --> 00:05:02.546
Yuma.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.582
That little dweeb!

00:05:05.582 --> 00:05:09.886
(Haru)
Kari... where are you going?

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:10.454
I can't sit by

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.856
while that little squirt
gets into big trouble!

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:13.824
Now, Kari, wait.

00:05:13.824 --> 00:05:16.193
Yuma asked us
not to worry about him.

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.628
But how often
is Yuma ever right?

00:05:18.628 --> 00:05:20.230
This sounds really dangerous.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.233
I mean, Grandma,
what if he never comes home?

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:25.902
Yuma is coming home!

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:26.937
(gasps)

00:05:26.937 --> 00:05:29.473
He said he would,
and I believe him!

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:32.275
We just have to.
(sobbing)

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:33.944
Let Yuma be, Kari.

00:05:33.944 --> 00:05:35.912
You can't protect him forever.

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:38.749
He'll be fine, I promise.

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.717
Now, then, he said he'd be back
for breakfast,

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:42.919
so I still have time
to make his favorite dish...

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.888
(thinking) Be careful, Yuma.

00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:47.924
It's delicious
and almost nutritious!

00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:50.394
♪♪

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:58.668
(Astral)
Yuma, are you worried
about Quinton and Trey?

00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:02.939
Astral, I understand
why they want to get revenge

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.575
for what happened to Quattro,

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:07.344
but can't they understand

00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:09.413
that dueling's
for making friends,

00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:11.181
not for hurting your enemies?

00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.850
You have your own ideas
about dueling

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.887
which do not coincide
with theirs.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.688
They believe
their ideas are right

00:06:18.688 --> 00:06:21.925
and have chosen to pursue
their own course of action.

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.928
So, if they're doing
what they think is right,

00:06:24.928 --> 00:06:28.532
you should go ahead and do
whatever you think is right.

00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:31.835
That's what you've
always done, Yuma.

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:33.937
Why stop now?

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.939
(gasps)

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:39.576
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:39.943 --> 00:06:44.748
At least, I hope we are making
the right decision.

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:51.520
I will allow you to face me
two-on-one,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.423
but you will have to share
your life points.

00:06:54.423 --> 00:06:58.127
All right,
but we get to begin the duel.

00:06:58.127 --> 00:06:59.862
I'll go first.
Okay.

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:03.365
Then, let's get this started,
Mizar!

00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:09.571
To begin, I'll use my Deep-Space
Cruiser IX's special ability.

00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:10.739
I can summon this card

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:14.343
by sending one Machine-Type
monster that's in my hand

00:07:14.343 --> 00:07:15.644
to the graveyard.

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.846
And I can do just that
right now

00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:23.218
because I have another
Deep-Space Cruiser IX.

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.326
And now I use Monster Reborn!

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.696
It restores
my other Deep-Space Cruiser IX

00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:37.332
so it can join the battle.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:41.537
I overlay
my two Deep-Space Cruiser IXs.

00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:42.805
With these two monsters,

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:48.243
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:57.252
Appear, Number 9, Dyson Sphere.

00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:03.492
It is colossal!

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:05.861
I see it,
but I can't believe it!

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:06.795
Oh, I believe it.

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.865
I just hope I never
have to face it.

00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:15.871
I activate the card
Spell Summon Stopper!

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:18.874
This puts a stop
to you using a spell

00:08:19.108 --> 00:08:22.511
to bring out a monster
next turn.

00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:27.216
I studied the duel data
I got from my brother Quattro

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.852
when he dueled Shark.

00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:33.222
I learned
that using Rank-Up-Magic

00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:35.324
to summon a Chaos Xyz Monster

00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:37.559
is the key
to your Barian strategy,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.561
so I'll prevent you
from using it.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.431
We shall see
if your strategy was correct.

00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:43.232
Yes, we shall.

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.801
For now, I place two cards
facedown

00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.869
and end my turn.

00:08:46.869 --> 00:08:47.769
Huh?

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:49.872
Quinton, look!
Huh?

00:08:52.107 --> 00:08:54.877
Came to watch
this Barian beatdown?

00:08:54.877 --> 00:08:57.212
Soon the stage will be set.

00:08:57.212 --> 00:09:00.549
Dumon, Marin,
you two are not needed.

00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:02.718
You go after Yuma and Kite.

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:03.852
All right.

00:09:03.852 --> 00:09:05.854
Ready, Quinton?

00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:10.692
Leaving so soon?
You just got here.

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.840
Why don't you all
stay for a while?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.409
It seems we don't have
much choice.

00:09:28.877 --> 00:09:33.849
Well, well, looks like someone
built a better mousetrap.

00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:36.652
The perfect way
to catch rats like them!

00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:38.387
I think I'll stick around.

00:09:38.387 --> 00:09:40.422
Wouldn't want
to miss them suffer.

00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:43.859
Dumon, Marin, leave this to me!

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:46.428
Quinton, I should thank you.

00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:47.262
By trapping us all here,

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:49.231
you have given me
a captive audience.

00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:52.434
Now the others can relish
watching me beat you.

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:54.870
I promise to give them
quite a show,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.207
though I imagine
you will be in too much distress

00:09:58.207 --> 00:09:59.274
to enjoy it!

00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:00.175
To start things off,

00:10:00.175 --> 00:10:02.644
I play Schwarzschild Limit
Dragon!

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.247
I can summon
this dreaded dragon

00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:06.381
since your Dyson Sphere

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.152
has more than 2,000
attack points.

00:10:12.854 --> 00:10:16.458
Next, I activate
the spell Ergosphere!

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:18.594
Soon you will be seeing double

00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:21.863
because I can add another
Schwarzschild Limit Dragon

00:10:22.097 --> 00:10:23.865
from my deck to my hand.

00:10:23.865 --> 00:10:26.702
It will be déjàà vu
for you two fools

00:10:26.702 --> 00:10:31.707
because I get to summon it
just like before.

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:36.578
Now, then, where was I?

00:10:36.578 --> 00:10:39.781
Oh, yes, about to destroy you!

00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:43.418
I overlay
two Level 8 Schwarzschilds!

00:10:43.418 --> 00:10:45.854
That lets me build
the Overlay Network

00:10:46.088 --> 00:10:48.824
and Xyz Summon!

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:57.866
Come forth, Number 107!

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:05.107
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!
(dragon roaring)

00:11:12.514 --> 00:11:16.852
I thought this'd be tough.
Now I know it.

00:11:20.856 --> 00:11:23.859
Looks like Mizar
has his hands full.

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:26.328
(Girag)
Nash, we got big trouble.

00:11:26.328 --> 00:11:27.396
What's wrong?

00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:29.865
Yuma and his friends are gone!

00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:31.133
Gone where?

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:31.833
I don't know how,

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:34.236
but they're headed
for Barian World.

00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:36.872
For Barian World?

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:38.540
(growls) Yuma.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.245
Girag, we're returning
to Barian World.

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:51.119
Hurry.
There ain't much time.

00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:58.126
Galaxy-Eyes,

00:11:58.126 --> 00:11:59.628
attack Dyson Sphere

00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:03.365
with Tachyon Spiral
of Destruction!

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:05.167
I can't let that hit me.

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:08.236
I activate Dyson Sphere's
special ability.

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:10.639
When Dyson Sphere
has Overlay Units,

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.709
it stops your monster's attack.

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:14.543
For now.

00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:17.746
I activate Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon's

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:18.847
special ability.

00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:20.615
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.852
it negates your Dyson Sphere's
special abilities.

00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:24.853
(dragon roaring)

00:12:25.087 --> 00:12:28.523
Tachyon Transmigration!

00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:43.138
Hmm.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:43.805
And there's more.

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.242
Since Dyson Sphere tried to use
its special ability,

00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:52.647
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
gains 1,000 attack points.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.155
Traverse time and space.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:05.527
Now arise anew,
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!

00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:07.796
(dragon roaring)

00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:13.602
It may have more attack points,
but at least the battle's over.

00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:15.871
(laughs)
That is what you think.

00:13:16.104 --> 00:13:17.105
Tachyon Transmigration

00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:21.276
also lets Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon attack again.

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:23.612
Again?
(whimpers)

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:24.179
And this time

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:27.115
you cannot use
Dyson Sphere's special ability

00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:27.849
to stop the attack.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:31.420
Do it again,
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.654
Attack Dyson Sphere

00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:36.525
with Tachyon Spiral
of Destruction!

00:13:48.103 --> 00:13:49.871
(both screaming)

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.410
(both groan)

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.313
My Galaxy-Eyes
is more than enough monster

00:13:58.313 --> 00:13:59.848
for you two amateurs.

00:13:59.848 --> 00:14:02.384
Had enough?
Of course you have.

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.419
But there is more on the way!

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:07.856
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:07.856 --> 00:14:09.090
And lucky for you,

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.860
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon's
attack points

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.430
go back down to 3,000.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:17.299
(Orbital) Master Kite!

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:20.335
Quinton's Dyson Sphere,
it was destroyed!

00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:23.572
Quinton and Trey
must be in t-trouble!

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:24.339
I'm not worried.

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:26.208
Those two
can take care of themselves

00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:27.876
and hopefully the Barians, too.

00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:31.847
Right now my focus
is on what I need to do.

00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:34.449
And that's
accomplish my mission!

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:37.152
(Orbital) Roger!

00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:41.723
Your Tachyon's power
is very... annoying,

00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:43.558
but I'll take care of that.

00:14:43.558 --> 00:14:45.861
(laughs) Oh, really?

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:46.661
Really.

00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:49.764
And trust me,
you'll never see it coming.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.467
Allow me!

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:53.768
(grunts)

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:54.803
I'll get things going

00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:58.874
by summoning
Chronomaly Gordian Knot!

00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:02.844
Chronomaly Gordian Knot

00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:04.846
lets me summon
another Chronomaly monster

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.416
without any
of its special abilities.

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:12.854
So, say hello
to Chronomaly Sol Monolith!

00:15:12.854 --> 00:15:15.123
Then Chronomaly Gordian Knot's
Level

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.760
becomes the same
as Chronomaly Sol Monolith's,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.694
making it Level 6.

00:15:19.694 --> 00:15:26.234
I overlay Level 6 Gordian Knot
and Sol Monolith.

00:15:26.234 --> 00:15:27.202
With these two monsters,

00:15:27.202 --> 00:15:31.873
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon.

00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:38.613
Come out, Number 6...

00:15:38.613 --> 00:15:41.182
Chronomaly Atlandis!

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.864
This will not save you.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.337
(Trey)
Now that I've got my rock-solid
Chronomaly Atlandis out,

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.639
it can equip a Number
in the graveyard

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:07.809
and gain its attack points.

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:12.147
And Dyson Sphere just happens
to be in the graveyard.

00:16:12.147 --> 00:16:16.651
That means Atlandis
is about to get a power-up!

00:16:19.087 --> 00:16:21.089
I'm not going
to let that happen.

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:25.226
I activate
the trap Tachyon Flare Wing!

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:27.729
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
equips it

00:16:27.729 --> 00:16:31.866
to negate your Atlandis' special
abilities!

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.438
So, Atlandis cannot gain
attack points!

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:46.081
Atlandis cannot defeat
Tachyon Dragon now!

00:16:47.148 --> 00:16:48.483
Are you sure?

00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:48.850
Think again.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.586
You played right into our hands,
Mizar.

00:16:51.586 --> 00:16:53.755
Your hands?

00:16:53.755 --> 00:16:54.556
That's right!

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.359
Let's show him
what we mean, Trey!

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:00.629
Ha!
It would be my pleasure!

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:07.802
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force!

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.509
(groaning)

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.280
(grunting)

00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:26.621
I overlay Rank 6 Atlandis!

00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:31.259
With this one monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.462
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:36.364
(grunting)

00:17:36.364 --> 00:17:44.339
Appear, Chaos Number 6,
Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis!

00:18:01.756 --> 00:18:02.290
Impossible!

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.226
How could these humans
have this power?

00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:07.662
Go, Chaos Atlandis!

00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:09.864
Attack Tachyon Dragon!

00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:12.634
Chaos Punishment!

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:16.705
In your dreams, little boy!

00:18:16.705 --> 00:18:19.808
I activate Tachyon
Flare Wing's effect!

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.342
By sending it to the graveyard,

00:18:21.342 --> 00:18:26.147
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
is not destroyed.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.785
(groans)

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.455
(laughs)

00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:37.158
You can do anything you wish,
but it does not matter.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.495
You will never destroy
my Galaxy-Eyes.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.863
Hmm.
Huh?

00:18:41.863 --> 00:18:44.699
Wrong again, Mizar.

00:18:44.699 --> 00:18:45.667
What?

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.168
Try to keep up!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.270
Since Tachyon Flare Wing
was destroyed,

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.341
I can use Chronomaly Chaos
Atlandis' special abilities!

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.877
That means
Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis

00:18:55.877 --> 00:18:58.279
can equip the monster
it battled!

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:00.715
Huh?
This cannot be!

00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:02.817
Do it, Chaos Atlandis!

00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:06.254
Take his Tachyon Dragon!

00:19:11.593 --> 00:19:12.861
(roaring)

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:13.862
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:18.166
Chaos Atlandis also gets
1,000 extra attack points

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:21.202
for every card it equips.

00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:32.313
You little thief!

00:19:32.313 --> 00:19:34.849
He stole Tachyon Dragon!

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:35.750
You're right.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.385
All their moves were planned

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:40.255
to rob Mizar
of his Galaxy-Eyes.

00:19:40.255 --> 00:19:41.289
(growls)

00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:47.595
You have made a fool of me
with your insolent tricks!

00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:53.434
I have never, never been
humiliated like this!

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:56.171
It was a lot easier
than we thought it'd be.

00:19:56.171 --> 00:19:59.340
So, now I place
two cards facedown

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.542
and end my turn.

00:20:00.542 --> 00:20:03.511
But it is I
who will end the duel!

00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:05.346
You see, mocking me has ensured

00:20:05.346 --> 00:20:08.683
the very worst
is yet to come your way.

00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:11.619
Chaos Draw!

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:15.590
I chose the very card
I wanted...

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.859
Rank-Up-Magic The Seventh One!

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:22.197
I can use it to summon
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!

00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:25.867
(gasps) Oh, no!

00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:32.774
No.

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:33.741
No!

00:20:33.741 --> 00:20:35.643
Afraid so, Mizar.

00:20:35.643 --> 00:20:36.744
From our data on Shark,

00:20:36.744 --> 00:20:38.713
I know you can use
The Seventh One

00:20:38.713 --> 00:20:41.382
to rank up your Number
into a Chaos Number

00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:43.718
as long as it's
in your graveyard.

00:20:43.718 --> 00:20:46.454
But it's not in your graveyard,
is it?

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.456
It belongs to us now.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.191
And do you know why?

00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:51.359
It's simple.

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:52.427
Because we stole it

00:20:52.427 --> 00:20:55.864
so you couldn't use
your rank-up magic card.

00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:57.632
Your goal
from the very beginning

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:03.504
was to prevent me from summoning
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon.

00:21:06.374 --> 00:21:08.877
(Vector) Mercy, mercy me!

00:21:08.877 --> 00:21:10.578
Poor Mizar.

00:21:10.578 --> 00:21:13.481
You just got schooled, fool!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.850
(growling)

00:21:17.518 --> 00:21:19.854
You may think
you have angered me,

00:21:19.854 --> 00:21:23.758
but all I feel is pity...
pity for you...

00:21:23.758 --> 00:21:27.862
because your last move
has assured that you two cretins

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:32.867
will suffer an agonizing defeat
at my hands!

00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:10.531
