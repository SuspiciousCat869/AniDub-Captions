WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.036
(Yuma)
Last time on
"YuGiOh: ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:06.740
Come on Vector,
let's see what you've got!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.610
I always knew you
were a coward.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.712
How dare you speak
to me that way!

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:16.316
You don't command
any respect, unlike Nash.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.319
Speaking of your dear,
beloved brother...

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.756
You didn't have
the itsy-bitsiest clue

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.758
that I already
caught him!

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.293
(shocked gasp)

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.127
Nash!

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.630
Every time I get
my life points back,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.766
I get my energy
by stealing his!

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.269
(maniacal laughing)

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:36.470
(man)
Well, well, well!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.238
If it ain't my
ol' pal Alito.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.741
I can't believe you
betrayed Don Thousand

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.742
to team up with Yuma.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.378
But I can believe
I'm gonna take you out!

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.647
You're gonna need
this Alito.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.416
Beat Girag with
this Number.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.518
It'll free him
of Don Thousand.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.721
I won't let
you down Yuma.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:59.760
I activate the trap
Sacred Shield!

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.062
Dumon... You're brilliant!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:06.133
This makes Ragnafinity powerful
enough to defeat Vector!

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:06.767
We'll win!

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.736
Sacred Shield
has one final effect.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.572
I must take all
the damage

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.341
that it absorbed
at the end of this turn.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.610
That means
you'll lose!

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.345
I end my turn.

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:23.750
Dumon!

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:28.255
Ragnafinity attack
Manipulator of Souls!

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.491
I did it Dumon.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.492
I won.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.762

Guess who!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.765
Vector!

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.166
How did you survive?

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.736
I've got Don Thousand's Throne
to thank for that!

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.273
I sent it to the graveyard
which stopped the attack

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.643
and instantly
ended your turn, Marin!

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.579
And there's more...

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.014
Much more!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:01.581
What?

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.252
Its final effect ranks up
Manipulator of Souls into

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.621
a Chaos Xyz Monster.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.323
A Chaos Monster?

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:14.194
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.636
Show yourself,
Chaos Number 43!

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:27.340
High Manipulator of Chaos!

Almost there.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:55.736
Galaxy-Eyes...

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.539
(Orbital Seven)
Emergency!

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.708
Guidance systems unresponsive.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.077
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.614
(groaning)

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.157
Activate propulsion mode!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.535
What is that thing?

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:42.549
This is the brawl for
it all, Alito.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:46.019
An' it's gonna be
a knockout win for me!

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.388
Since you lost
your Barian powers,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.057
you're weaker than
a flyweight!

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.759
You're goin' down!

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.760
Oh, no!

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.395
This looks bad.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.496
Have faith.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.632
I believe Alito has a plan.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:00.767
I'm still in
this fight, Girag.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.571
I overlay my Level 2 Battlin'
Boxer Big Bandages

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.407
to build the Overlay Network!

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.577
I Xyz Summon,
Number 64:

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:14.214
Ronin Raccoon Sandayu!

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.289
What the...

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.758
That used to be
my Number!

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.629
(screaming)

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.104
And you are...?

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:41.741
I'm Ponta,
a Number Guardian!

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.742
It's Ponta

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.377
Hey you're all right!

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.746
A Number Guardian?

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.582
You came just at
the right time.

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.318
I'm trying to make Girag
come to his senses.

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:52.752
Will you help me?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.988
You bet I will!

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:56.623
(groaning)

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.123
I activate

00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:01.027
Ronin Raccoon Sandayu's
special ability!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.029
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.167
I summon one
Kagemusha Raccoon Token!

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:12.172
Now, Kagemusha Raccoon Token's
attack points become the same as

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:15.976
the monster with the most
attack points on the field!

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.646
So it's got just as
many attack points

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.114
as your Giant Red Hand!

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.985
Alright, Kagemusha attack
Giant Red Hand!

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:26.987
You're out of
your head!

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:30.624
Only a Number
can destroy a Number!

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:38.632
I'm very well
aware of that, Girag!

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:41.368
Are you aware
of this?

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:43.303
The trap Last Counter?

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:47.741
Your monster gives all its
attack points to my Number!

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.749
It's got 3,600
attack points?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.518
If Alito destroys
Girag's Chaos Number

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.686
with the Mythyrian Number,

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.588
Don Thousand
won't control him!

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:05.759
Ronin Raccoon Sandayu
attack Giant Red Hand!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:07.560
Yeah!

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.263
This'll bring Girag
to his senses!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.512
All right Girag,
it's time!

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:29.115
Remember what really
happened to you!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.651
(monstrous screaming)

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:35.121
I will now
rewrite your memories.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.489
My... memories?

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:39.426
You will believe your
leaders betrayed you

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.761
and set up your downfall.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.764
Your thirst for revenge
will serve me well

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.466
in Barian World.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:50.704
Your mind and soul
both belong to me!

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.039
(monstrous screaming)

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.377
(screaming)

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:01.114
(Girag)
Yes...

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.450
I remember now!

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:07.754
Girag!

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.762
Let's get this show
on the road, Marin!

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:18.698
Presenting Cursed Chaos!

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:22.736
Now you have to pay 500 life
points if your want to activate

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.738
your monster's special ability.

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:28.742
Aww, but you only have 500
life points left,

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:31.544
so you can't
afford to!

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.479
But wait!

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.179
It gets worse!

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.550
I activate High Manipulator
of Chaos's special ability!

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.252
When you have
a monster with more

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.021
attack points than you
have life points,

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.724
I can use one
Chaos Overlay Unit to summon

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.760
a Manipulator Token!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.996
Uhn!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.167
(screaming)

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.971
Manipulator Token's attack
points become the same as your

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:02.342
life points, and it can attack
for every Chaos Overlay Unit

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:05.278
that High Manipulator
of Chaos has!

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:09.049
That happens to
be three times...

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.185
But it's only got
500 attack points!

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.254
Attack as many times
as you want!

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.056
My monster will
wipe it out!

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.158
I'm not sure
about that...

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:22.729
Manipulator Token,
attack Ragnafinity!

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:29.335
You just destroyed
your own monster!

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.737
(laughing)

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.038
Wrong-o!

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:35.508
Manipulator Token can't
be destroyed in battle,

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:38.144
and I don't take any damage!

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.679
So it survives?

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.016
Not only that,
but High Manipulator of Chaos

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.217
gains attack points

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.285
equal to
the damage

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.087
I would've taken!

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.121
No!

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.055
Yes!

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.757
And the fun doesn't stop!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:54.360
Manipulator Token,
attack again!

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.632
(gasping)

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.567
Well, what do you know...

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:04.737
Even more attack points for
High Manipulator of Chaos!

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.739
I do hope you're
watching, Nash,

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:10.376
because the third time's
the charm.

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:16.282
(Nash)
Vector... enough!

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.018
You've got me
where you want me.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:21.020
Vector...

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.589
Let her go!

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:25.758
Vector.

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:30.997
Vector and Don Thousand...
messed up my head!

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.636
Alito!

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:41.407
You were a tough nut to crack,
Girag, but it seems I finally

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:44.410
broke Don Thousand's
control over you.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.280
I hope it was
worth the effort.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.182
You saved me.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:50.617
Alito!

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:53.119
Stay there!

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.722
There's one
last step in our duel.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:57.757
Due to my trap card,
Last Counter,

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.759
I take damage equal to

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.761
the monster that
was destroyed.

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.763
That's 2,600 points...

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:07.767
And I've only got
200 life points left.

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.070
Why, Alito?

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.473
Why you taking
a dive for me?

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.742
Girag, no matter
what happened,

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:18.745
you were
always in my corner.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:22.982
I'm glad I finally go
t the chance to be in yours.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.552
Alito...

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:26.519
Yuma...

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.253
Astral...

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.289
I just fought
my last round.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:31.758
I wish I could've
helped you more...

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:35.695
but you'll have to defeat
Don Thousand without me.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.264
If anybody can do it,
you can.

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.767
You're... champions.

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.735
Alito!

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.737
Goodbye.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.206
And thanks, Yuma.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.640
For everything.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.310
Alito!

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.562
No... Alito!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.763
(crying)

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.534
Alito!

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.710
Alito!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.314
Vector...

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.383
(Vector)
Now High Manipulator
of Chaos

00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:33.753
has 18,600
attack points!

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:37.357
This puppet's
gonna pulverize you!

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:39.525
(gasping, grunting)

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.061
High Manipulator of Chaos,

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.763
attack Ragnafinity

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.766
and finish her forever!

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:54.974
(screaming)

00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:02.682
Marin...

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:07.754
(grunting)

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:29.042
Now, Dumon and Marin's
powers are mine!

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:32.512
I can feel it
surging within me...

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:35.214
No one can stop me
any longer!

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:36.683
(Don Thousand)
Vector.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:38.751
You must go to
Girag at once!

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:43.756
He has become a wild card that
could jeopardize everything!

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.729
(Orbital Seven)
Master Kite,
I've detected an energy mass

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:51.531
that's heading this way!

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:00.573
Mizar.

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.141
About time.

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.142
I have arrived.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:06.112
Yet I am certain
you knew that I would come.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:10.550
How unfortunate that Quinton
and Trey are unable to join us.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.518
I know.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.020
No thanks to you.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.155
I have a great deal
of respect for them.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:21.060
They battled me to the end so
you and Yuma could get away.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.695
I know.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.767
Thanks to them I can finally
prove that I am the true

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:29.102
Galaxy-Eyes master

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:31.738
I would not
count on that.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.644
(Yuma)
Alito...

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:42.048
We were finally
gonna be teammates.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.418
Why'd this
have to happen?

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:46.753
I'm so...

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:48.654
sorry, Alito.

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.357
(sobbing)

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.262
Don Thousand and Vector
tricked us both...

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:59.766
Messed up
both our memories.

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:00.967
It's their fault!

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:04.704
Don Thousand and Vector...
you'll pay!

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:06.439
(maniacal laughing)

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:07.573
Huh?

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.741
Huh?

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.176
(Vector)
Girag!

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.677
Yuma!

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.613
I've come for you!

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:15.681
Uh!
Ah!

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:19.719
Ah!

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.555
(screaming)

00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:23.756
Girag!

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.625
(Girag screaming)

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.427
You brainless oaf!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.362
You brutish buffoon!

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:32.698
If you hadn't gotten in my way,
I could've captured

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.400
Yuma's powers!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.303
That is, if he had any.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.738
(growling)

00:15:38.738 --> 00:15:41.741
Girag, what made
you save me?

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.744
My best friend
risked his life for you.

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:47.747
I thought I should
do the same.

00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:49.749
Now it's up
to you, Yuma.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.083
You go get 'em.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.752
Girag.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.354
(Ponta)
Master!

00:15:56.155 --> 00:16:00.593
I always knew that you would do
the right thing in the end!

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:02.195
Ponta.

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.664
Oh, enough already!

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.237
Girag!
Ponta!

00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:14.740
(maniacal laughing)

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.543
No, they're gone....

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.744
Why you...

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:19.412
Vector!

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:22.482
Girag and Alito
are no more, Yuma.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.350
And I have their powers.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.618
But they won't
be lonely.

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:29.755
They'll be with
Dumon and Marin!

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.224
No way!

00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:32.425
You're lying!

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.193
Oh, I'm telling the truth.

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:37.363
Which is quite rare
for me, I know.

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.999
How horrible.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:40.766
Vector!

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:43.469
Next I'll crush you, Astral

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.971
and the rest of
the Emperors,

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.340
and then the Numeron Code
will be mine!

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:50.243
(chuckling)

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:51.444
Huh?

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:54.380
Vector...

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.750
(screaming)

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:03.756
You're lucky I've got a nasty
little Nash that no ointment

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:08.361
can cure, but I'll be back to
vaporize you both!

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.662
Vector!

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.100
No!

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.670
This duel has been
a long time in the making.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.107
It has brought our two
Galaxy-Eyes together...

00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:22.708
And interestingly enough

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:26.078
their union today will
also act as a key.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:29.015
A key to unlocking
the Numeron Code.

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.751
I uncovered everything
about the Numeron Code

00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:33.519
when I returned
to the ruins

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.054
where I battled Jinlon.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.756
There I found
a stone monolith

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:39.759
and learned the legend
of the Numeron Code.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:43.429
Well, Kite, you came
as I knew you would.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:44.263
Jinlon.

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:48.668
Here is written the secret
history of how the Numeron Code

00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:50.469
came to be.

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:51.737
At the dawn of time,

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:55.341
there was a single dragon,
the source of all knowledge.

00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:59.579
As it was the only creature in
existence, it was lonely,

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:03.182
so to cure its loneliness it
used its power

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:05.318
to create the universe.

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:09.322
However, this massive act of
creation used up

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:10.756
all the dragon's power,

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:14.727
so the dragon started to
fade away into nothing.

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:16.762
This made the dragon sad,

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.764
as it would never
be able to witness

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.766
how the universe would unfold.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.704
Mourning the loss of what was
not to be, the dragon shed

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:28.608
a single tear
before it vanished.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.747
That tear held all the dragon's
knowledge and emotions.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:38.985
It traveled across
the vast cosmos, until...

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:41.988
it collided
with the Earth

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:44.523
and the force
of its impact

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.093
gave birth to the moon.

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:52.098
The knowledge in that tear
created the Numeron Code!?

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:52.765
Yes.

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:56.736
The Numeron Code
remains hidden on Earth

00:18:56.736 --> 00:19:00.006
and the key to finding it
is on the moon.

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:03.509
Since the Numeron Code
can rewrite both the past

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.043
and the future,

00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:07.346
the dragon knew it must be
protected from those who

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.682
would use it for evil.

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:14.654
For this reason, the dragon used
the Numbers to put a seal of

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:17.089
protection on the Code.

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:20.259
(Kite)
Carved in the stone
I found this riddle:

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.694
"Dragons of light and time,

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:23.663
born in the land
hidden by light.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:27.767
A duel at this unseen soil
will reveal the code."

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.736
The riddle only
points to one place.

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:33.139
That's what led me
to the moon.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:35.341
The dragons of light and time

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.544
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon
and Tachyon Dragon.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:41.514
Exactly, and when they
battle on this sacred land,

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:45.584
the winner will get the key
to the Numeron Code.

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:49.755
That means the stakes
have never been higher.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.756
Not only will we learn

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.392
who the true
Galaxy-Eyes master is...

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.295
whoever wins will be
one step closer

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.763
to the Numeron Code.

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:01.167
Actually, there's even
more at stake.

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.102
What makes you
think that?

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:06.605
There were two Galaxy-Eyes
engraved on the monolith,

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:10.076
but there was also
a third dragon.

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:12.178
What could it be?

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:15.381
Battle me and find out
for yourself!

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:17.550
I thought you
would never ask.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.454
Now we shall finally discover
which one of us is the true

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:24.223
Galaxy-Eyes master!

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:28.694
(grunting)

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.996
♪

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.767
Let's duel!
Let us duel!
