00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.890
Kite: Little brother,
there's been a complication.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.960
A kid named YUMA has partnered
up with the envoy from astral

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
world. Like me, they've
been gathering numbers.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.390
but I promise you, I
will take care of them.

YUMA: Gaaah!

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.190
Late!

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.760
KARI: Hang on a second, yuma.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.330
I don't have a second!

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.860
I'm gonna be way late!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.560
The clothes you dumped on the
floor when you came home

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.090
last night smelled
like smoked fish.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.760
And this morning, I read
there was an explosion at a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.190
warehouse down in the
pier district. You weren't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.760
down there last
night, were you?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.190
Of course I wasn't.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.660
Can I please go to school now?

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.830
I don't wanna be late.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.290
They're saying it was
an electrical fire,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.190
but this has cover up
written all over it.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
Heartland enterprises owns that
building and big media, so...

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.160
wow that's really cool,
gotta go, catch ya' later!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.030
Uh, yuma?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.960
Litterbots: Trash identified.
Trash identified.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.160
Astral: Your sister
is quite intuitive.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.730
She will eventually find out
what you are involved in.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.830
What matters to me is
that my key is safe, and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.790
we got shark's soul back!

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.230
Oh, and I'm glad
you're okay too.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.760
I must admit, I am
still feeling a bit shaken.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.990
The fact that Kite has
the power to enter your

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.060
key is most concerning.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.260
Yeah, he's full of surprises.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.730
It's like every time I think
I'm starting to figure him out,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.330
he throws a curve ball.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.730
Who is he?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.990
Race ya!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.460
We're clearly still in the dark
when it comes to who Kite is.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.730
But we did learn something
new during that last duel.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.490
He cannot be controlled by
the power of the number cards.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.230
Up until now, the duelists we
have faced who were using number

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190
cards were being
controlled by the cards.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.830
The numbers had taken them
over, and were making them act

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.290
strangely, or
against their wills.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.390
But that does not seem
to be the case with Kite.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.560
He seems to be
perfectly in control.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.660
It is very possible that Kite is
in possession of a power that is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.330
not of this world.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.730
Whoa, what kind of power?

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.330
I do not know.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.690
But the galaxy-Eyes photon
Dragon that he uses, the light

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.590
that lives inside that monster
triggers a strange feeling

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.890
inside me, it makes me wonder if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.190
that Dragon comes
from a different world.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.090
It might help if we
knew how collecting

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.890
number cards helps him.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.890
How are your memories supposed
to save his little brother?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.960
Perhaps they
cannot save him.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.560
Perhaps This is
just about stopping me.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.130
Stopping you?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.060
Suppose that upon regaining
my memories, I will discover

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.830
something that
threatens his plans.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.930
We do not know what
situation his brother is in.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.490
What if me regaining
my memories is what puts his

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.490
little brother in danger?

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.860
So you're saying, Kite gathering
the numbers might not be about

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.530
making something happen, it
might be about making sure that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.890
something doesn't happen.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.630
Agh, what am I doing?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.130
I'm late!

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.430
What's up, Tori?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.530
Tori: We're late,
that's what's up!

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.360
[Bell rings]

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.560
man!

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.890
They make these
classes too early.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.260
Ya know, this is
your fault, yuma.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.330
With everything that happened
last night at the warehouse, the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.630
duel, the explosion,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.290
I was up half the
night worrying about you.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.860
Because of that, I
slept through my alarm!

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.030
And by you, I
mean both of you.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.730
I was really worried
about astral too!

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.430
Hey, you hear that, astral?

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.790
Because of you two,
I'm gonna get detention.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.790
It's gonna be
okay, I promise.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.990
Well, I'm just glad
you're okay now, astral.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.530
He's over here, actually.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.830
Whatever!

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.660
He can hear me, right?

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.130
Bronk: Yuma, Tori!

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.460
Hey, guys. Welcome
to the tardiness club!

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.890
Oh man, that warehouse last
night Sure was dangerous!

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.890
I was shakin' so much when
I got home, I couldn't sleep.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.690
Caswell: Neither could I.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.460
But in the end, I'm glad we
were able to be there for you.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.560
Heh!

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.590
Thanks for yesterday, you guys.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.890
Cathy: You're welcome.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.360
Didn't see ya' there!

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.530
It's okay.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.560
No one ever does.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.960
Oh sorry, cat.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.060
Flip: Heard you had
an adventure yesterday!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.330
TOGETHER: Flip!

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
And why wasn't I invited?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.530
It's not like we
planned it or anything.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.360
[bell rings]

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.590
that's the second bell.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.760
We've gotta go!

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.460
I can't miss history again!

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.690
What's this?

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.390
Uh, guys?

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.560
Wha?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.960
What's goin' on?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.930
Ehh...

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.460
why aren't they moving?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.030
Because, time seems
to have stopped.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.760
Is this Kite's doing?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.090
No, this is something else.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.530
Mr. Heartland: Dr. Faker,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.160
what's going on?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.030
Dr FAKER: Two electromagnetic
surges, one from astral world,

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.760
one from another world,
collided right on top of earth.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.790
Because of the energy generated
in that collision, time has

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.490
temporarily stopped.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.430
How can time just stop?

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.430
These things happen, heartland.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.030
In a matter of hours, the
collisional aftershocks will

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.190
ripple away and everything
will return to normal.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.860
But there can be no mistake that
the two worlds are drawing

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.890
closer to one another.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.960
We're running out of time, we
must deal with astral world.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.060
Yuma, look!

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.830
This can't be happening.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.030
Why are there three
suns in the sky?

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.530
Uh... this day is getting
freakier and freakier.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.660
I know one of those suns.
I believe it shines on my world.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.330
I hope you're right
about this, orbital 7.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.760
This could prove most useful.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.790
Now you're sure This
is where they met?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.190
Orbital 7: I am!

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.560
Every action they've taken
leaves a footprint on the fabric

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.190
of time and space. With this
unexpected phenomena occurring,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.460
we can now see those footprints!

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.030
Their journey together
started right here.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.590
Yuma was dueling a
young human male named shark.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.690
Shark: Did you really think you
could beat me, the best of the

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.830
best, and win
bronk's deck back?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.730
yeah, I kinda did.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.160
I guess I was wrong.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.660
Face it, yuma!

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.990
I stomped your
little key to pieces,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.690
and now I'm gonna stomp you!

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.390
That's where
you're wrong, shark.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.360
Caus en you're feeling the
flow, there's no going back!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.960
And speaking of
feelin' the flow,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.990
I so am!

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.230
number: Yes shark,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.560
let the number take hold.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.190
I overlay level 3,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.230
big jaws and kraken!

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.260
Number 17,
leviathan Dragon,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.360
attack with Shock Stream blast!

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.690
Rise.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.130
Rise up!

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.760
Who, who are you?

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.190
At last, the stage is set.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.590
For what?

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.960
Teamwork.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.990
Overlay level 4 gagaga
magician and ganbara Knight.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.290
Hang on a sec.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.030
Is this what I think?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.690
Look at your deck, yuma.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.960
Whoa,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.260
it looks like an xyz monster.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.360
But I can't quite
make out which one.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.590
I can.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.330
Its number 39: Utopia.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.860
Now go, utopia!

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.430
Attack leviathan Dragon
with rising Sun slash!

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.930
What's going on with you?

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.290
Are you okay, astral?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.230
My head. I have never
felt like this before!

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.860
Someone is trying to get into
my head, and access my memories.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.260
Yuma, we need to revisit
the places we have dueled.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.390
But...

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.660
astral, wait,

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.690
come back!

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.430
the echoes of another duel Are
coming from inside that tower.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.090
Mr. Kay: It's over, yuma.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.330
I overlay crashbug
x, y and z.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.230
With these three monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.560
Here comes number 34!

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.330
Terror-Byte!

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.030
Do your stuff,
leviathan Dragon!

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.530
Attack With Shock Stream blast!

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.260
And now utopia's
gonna bring it home!

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.460
Direct attack!

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.190
Rising Sun slash!

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.390
There you are.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.360
You've never just taken
off like that before.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.260
It must be because of this
cosmic occurrence that I am now

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.490
able to move away from you.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.430
Oh, so what are we
looking for exactly?

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.930
You mean what is
he looking for?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.360
Wait, astral!

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.960
Stop flying off like that.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.190
Wait a minute, This is
where we dueled against flip.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.460
Correct.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.090
He was able to
seize our numbers.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.290
And as a result, my connection
to you was severed. It became up

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.290
to you to win the duel.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.790
I remember,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.060
you told me I had to protect
baby tiragon no matter what, so

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.190
I did, and that allowed me to
flip things around on flip and

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.190
get utopia and leviathan Dragon

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.460
back!

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.530
No please, you
can't do this to me!

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.430
Yeah!

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.860
Welcome home, you two!

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.060
Knowing who astral and yuma are
will help me defeat them.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.190
I wonder what details
this soundstage will reveal.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.490
Nelson has started thinking
that he's actually the Sparrow.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.490
Sparrow: Yuma, I didn't want it
to come to this. Alas, if you're

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.890
with the dark emperor,
then I have no choice

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.490
but to battle you!

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.690
Together: Let's duel!

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.760
I xyz summon!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.230
Kneel Before number
83 - Galaxy queen!

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.730
I have journeyed through time
and space to fight the forces of

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.760
evil and restore
justice to the galaxy!

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.530
Get ready Sparrow!

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.960
Cause so feeling the flow!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.660
Utopia, attack galaxy queen!

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.390
Go Rising sun slash!

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.930
Not so fast, yuma.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.160
I activate the trap
card 'star Sparrow forever!'

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.330
what is it?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.790
Is it a counter card?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.530
This card allows me to bring
star Sparrow out of my graveyard

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.330
with zero attack points!

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.130
And like he always does,
Sparrow jumps in to protect

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.190
those being attacked!

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.630
Yuma, do you recall the
duel we lost with shark?

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.530
Yeah.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.960
I was trying to get him
to stop hanging out with

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.560
scorch and chills.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.030
That is right.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.460
After that, we came here on the
night they were planning to

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.330
break into the museum.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.060
Then shark had an
unexpected change of heart,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.060
and allied with us.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.690
Together: Let's duel!

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.960
Scorch: I summon number 61,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.390
volcasaurus!

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.990
Say hello to a world of hurt!

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.430
Chills: Your number
card's as good as ours.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.190
Black ray lancer,
attack volcasaurus!

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.590
Your partner's outta the
picture and you've got no

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.760
monsters to hide behind.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.490
I think it's safe to
say that you're about to

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.890
get officially yuma-Ed!

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.430
Cause by sending utopia
to the graveyard,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.660
black ray lancer can charge in
again and attack you directly!

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.590
Arghh... No way!

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.730
Go Shimmering Spear slash!

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.630
And then after that duel, a few
days later, that was when we

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.190
first dueled Kite right here.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.330
Yes, and we were
far from prepared.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.030
That's one way to put it.
He wiped the floor with us.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.360
Now, galaxy-Eyes,
let him have it.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:16.490
Photon stream of destruction!

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.160
Even though Only a number
can destroy a number,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.090
you're still gonna take damage!

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.960
Next I'm gonna play this -

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.560
The spell card 'photon wind!'

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.830
and it will be knocking
the wind out of you.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.560
Because when I deal damage
without destroying your monster,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.090
you take an additional
1000 points of damage!

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.430
And that's not all my
photon wind lets me do.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.260
Now, I get to draw a card!

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.560
And then I'll place one...

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.390
facedown!

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.030
And with that, I'll end my turn.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.130
Astral...

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.630
as your life points diminish,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.830
my life force does with it.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.260
I have you right in
the Palm of my hand.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.030
Can you feel the crush
of defeat closing in?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.760
Go photon stream of...

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.130
incoming message.
Master Kite!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.890
We'll finish this later.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.260
But now,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.490
I must leave!

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.530
Good thing he stopped the duel
before we lost everything.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.790
Our numbers, you, and
you know, my soul.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.360
We got really down on
Ourselves after that.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.790
Luckily, grandma sent me to
see her friend master roku.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.190
Using the lessons he taught me
against his former student kaze,

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.460
helped me feel the flow again!

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.890
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.260
I xyz summon - Number 12!

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.330
Crimson Shadow armor ninja!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.130
I'm toast.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.590
Yuma, do not let your
doubt overtake you.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.560
Remember that you
are not alone.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.790
You have got your
friends with you.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.760
I understand that when
your back is to the wall,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.660
you may feel outnumbered.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.060
But you are not.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.890
When you have friends,
you are never alone.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.130
You're right, astral.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.330
No matter what we're up against,
we're all in it together!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.230
It's time to take a
stand with my friends and

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.860
kick some ninja Butt!

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.560
Utopia, take out
crimson shadow armor ninja!

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.160
This can't be!

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.690
And then when master roku gave
us the sanctuary's legendary

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.830
deck, not only was I back in
action, I was able to

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.190
step up my game!

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.660
And just in time.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.730
Cause that's when that freaky
fortuneteller forced me to duel

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.890
to save my friends!

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:03.160
Fortuno: I xyz summon,
number 16, shock master!

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.690
this feeling I have, this
trembling in my spirit,

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.890
I think I now understand
what it means to be afraid.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.060
you have to surrender your
number card yuma, in order to

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.960
save your friends, you have to.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.260
There's gotta be
another way, astral!

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.160
There is not.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.760
My friends Have always been
there when I needed them,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.060
good times and
bad times, ups and downs,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.730
through thick and thin,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.030
I'm not just gonna
ditch my friends.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.290
I know.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.690
That is why I
am saying you...

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.930
you still don't
get it, do you?

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.890
I said, I won't abandon any
of my friends, astral, and

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.990
you're my friend!

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.460
Whoa!

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.490
Yuma, win this.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.260
You got it, pal!

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.890
The path has been made!

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.060
Path?

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.230
For what?

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.360
For this. Chaos number 39.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.930
By combining utopia with it's
overlay units, utopia can

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.230
further evolve itself.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.630
The time is now, yuma.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.760
Together: Go
chaos xyz evolution!

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.390
Get ready for chaos number 39!

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.530
I give you - Utopia ray!

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.190
Do it, utopia ray!

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.890
Attack Big eye!

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.000
Rising Sun chaos slash!

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.990
Our efforts to learn more about
astral and yuma by Tracing

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.060
their memories have led us here.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.430
This is the location of their
most recent memory dealing

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.130
with a number.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.430
Well that's what you
get for grabbing at me.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.190
What is happening?

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.530
Astral!

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.960
Number 96...

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.760
it is trying to
take control of me!

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.230
What do you mean "trying
to take control of you"?

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.390
number 96: He means that when
you dropped your key, you

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.390
allowed me to escape.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.060
And now that I am free,
I can take control of your

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.530
dear friend, astral.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.190
Onto step two,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.630
acquiring number 39: Utopia!

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.360
Hey tall, dark and creepy,
if ya want this number so bad,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.130
beat me in a duel!

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.790
Next I am overlaying these
three level 2's in order

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:06.460
to build the overlay network and
xyz summon... a copy of myself,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.990
number 96: Dark mist!

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.260
I won't give up,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.160
just like yuma never has!

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.230
Go Rising sun slash!

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.130
No way... I... I lost?

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.090
Impossible!

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.960
Where are we now?

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.190
I knew he was the one
tracking our memories.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.730
Guys!

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.730
What happened,
are you okay?

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.830
Totally meant to do that.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.230
Hey uh, where is yuma?

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.690
We'll settle things at
the world duel carnival.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.190
I'm looking
forward to it, Kite.
