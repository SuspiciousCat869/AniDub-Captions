WEBVTT

00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:04.095
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.983
(man)
You won't get away!

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:17.604
What'd you do?
What'd you put in me?

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:20.949
It looks like my poison
is taking effect.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:21.852
Your poison?

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:25.697
So if you want to duel, we'd
better get started right away.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.636
Why would I waste my
time dueling you?

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.843
I don't think dueling would be
a waste of time if it keeps

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:34.424
your sister from visiting Davey
Jones' locker, do you, Shark?

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:37.233
Rio? You got
to her, too!

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:37.701
Mm-hmm!

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:41.113
But luckily there's a way her
big, strong brother Shark

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:42.316
can save her.

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:45.661
All you have to do is
defeat me in a duel.

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.165
All right, Chironex!

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.843
(man)
Hang on!

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.054
Quattro!

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.431
I'll start the duel
with 8,000 life points

00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.906
and you each get
2,000 life points!

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:02.648
If you were so great you
wouldn't need an advantage,

00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:03.283
would you?

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:06.861
We'll see how clever you are
when my poison is coursing

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.938
through your veins.

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:12.780
(all)
Let's duel!

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.525
Destruction Cannon!

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:25.922
How did he get two monsters?

(Quattro)
This can't be!

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.248
My last move destroyed
your only monster!

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:42.789
But now...
you've got two!

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.094
How could that happen?

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:47.036
I simply activated the
sneaky special ability

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:48.073
of my Stealth Kragen!

00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:51.885
Since it had two Overlay Units
when it was destroyed by your

00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:53.390
Gimmick Puppet Grinder,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.734
I was allowed to summon 2
slippery and slimy

00:02:56.734 --> 00:03:00.546
Kragen Spawn from the deep!

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.516
Lucky break for him.

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.626
And I'm about to get even
luckier since Stealth Kragen

00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:07.501
gave each one of
them one Overlay Unit

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:09.608
when it was destroyed.

00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:11.046
Ready for the best part?

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:15.929
They also have Stealth
Kragen's special abilities!

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:16.998
(Quattro)
This isn't good.

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:19.106
Those special
abilities stung us before

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.278
but now it's twice as potent.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:25.125
I've got to strike
fast and sink this guy!

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:29.538
I activate Grinder's
special ability!

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:33.618
By using one Overlay Unit,
both your Kragen Spawn are

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.160
pulverized!

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.603
And I've got more
bad news for you...

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:42.212
You take damage equal
to their attack points,

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:46.760
meaning you're gonna get
blasted for 3,800 points!

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.468
Destruction Cannon!

00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:57.160
That's what happens
when you test the best,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.798
you boneless Barian!

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:00.470
Way to go, Quattro!

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.085
I activate the special abilities
of my two Kragen Spawns.

00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:07.091
First, I'll bring Number 4:

00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.098
Stealth Kragen
back from the deep.

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:12.375
And then I'll summon
Kragen Spawn number three

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.518
to add some more sting!

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:22.373
I hope you like jellyfish,
'cause they'll be floating

00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:24.914
around till you're through!

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:29.562
I'll sink those jellyfish,
just you wait and see!

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:33.074
Yuma... no matter how many of
those monsters they destroy,

00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:34.646
they keep coming back.

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:36.150
How can they win?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.461
(Shark)
I can't lose
this duel!

00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.433
I can't lose...

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:43.707
for Rio!

00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:49.794
(Tori)
Yuma...

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:52.672
Rio's condition's
getting worse and worse!

00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:55.414
And the doctors are saying that
they don't know what to do to

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:56.651
make her better.

00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:57.654
Hurry up, Yuma.

00:04:57.654 --> 00:04:59.928
You gotta find a cure!

00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:02.134
<i>There's not much time!</i>

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:03.505
This is bad.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:04.576
If Shark keeps getting weaker,

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:07.853
he's not gonna be
able to beat that guy.

00:05:07.853 --> 00:05:08.689
Listen, Shark!

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.327
This spineless sicko won't stop.

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:12.568
So you have to stay
strong, you hear me?

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:14.541
This piece of slime's
never gonna give up,

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:17.149
and that means you're gonna
have to save being sick

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.286
for another day.

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:19.891
Have I made myself clear?

00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.536
Save your breath, Quattro.

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:27.181
I won't lose to
this gutless blob.

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.522
Shark...

00:05:29.522 --> 00:05:31.161
(Shark)
I can still talk tough...

00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:34.906
but this poison's making me
weaker by the second.

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:37.916
And even if I destroy
those jellyfish of his,

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.788
they'll just keep coming back.

00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:44.436
My only hope is to get rid of
his life points in one shot.

00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:48.081
But how do I...

00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:51.993
Abyss Splash!

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:53.967
That Number can do it.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.238
It's my turn.

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:57.745
I draw!

00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:01.423
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode.

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:02.260
Defense mode?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.166
I don't believe what
I'm seeing, don't you know

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.269
what's at stake here?

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.044
This is your chance to
attack and finish him off!

00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:09.683
You have to go on the offensive,

00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:11.221
while you still
have the strength.

00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:16.137
Show this freak you have
what it takes to beat him!

00:06:16.137 --> 00:06:16.906
Now, now, boys.

00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:20.250
No sense in fighting,
especially over me.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.490
Because both of you are losers!

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.601
I activate the
trap Receding Tide!

00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:29.914
This card gives your
facedown a facelift!

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:31.854
Ah, Skull Kraken.

00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:33.091
I see your strategy.

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.231
You played a Dark monster
since Stealth Kragen's

00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:38.375
special ability only
destroys Water monsters.

00:06:38.408 --> 00:06:41.752
But isn't your deck geared
towards Water monsters?

00:06:41.752 --> 00:06:44.862
What a scaredy-cat,
I mean scaredy-shark!

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.437
I don't care if you're
feeling under the weather!

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:49.276
You can't wimp out here.

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:51.215
You've got to save your sister!

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:52.753
Keep your advice to yourself.

00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:54.224
I end my turn!

00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:58.739
(Shark)
It's getting worse...
but I have to hang on...

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:00.746
'til I get the chance...

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:03.287
to crush him!

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:05.929
Your little scheme's
not going to work.

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:08.972
And here's why!

00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:13.185
I'm now activating
the spell Jelly Rain.

00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:17.933
All the monsters on the field
become Water monsters.

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:21.612
Now your monsters can't
escape from my jellyfish's

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:25.825
poisonous special ability.

00:07:27.297 --> 00:07:30.339
Who should I go after first?

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.815
Eeeny-meeny-miney-moe...

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:35.623
It's time for Quattro's to go!

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:39.502
Number 4: Stealth Kragen's
special ability destroys

00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:42.679
your Giant Grinder!

00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:51.340
You take Giant Grinder's
1,500 attack points as damage!

00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.870
One down, one to go.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.686
I activate Kragen Spawn's
special ability!

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.331
It destroys Skull Kraken...
and the 600 points of damage

00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:11.069
you take destroys
any chance you have of

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.009
saving you or sister!

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.182
Shark's only got
400 life points!

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:19.028
Oh, no, Shark's history!

00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:25.616
I activate the trap
Shade of Strings!

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:30.732
It puts a stop to your
monsters special ability!

00:08:30.732 --> 00:08:32.437
You've only delayed your end!

00:08:32.437 --> 00:08:35.982
You are goin' down,
one way or another!

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:40.897
Number 4: Stealth Kragen,
take out Skull Kraken!

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:43.639
Tentacle Surge!

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.790
Now Shark's got no monsters
left to protect himself.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.903
Kragen Spawn, finish off Shark!

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:54.073
Watch out!

00:08:54.073 --> 00:08:57.684
I activate the trap
Deep Current!

00:08:57.684 --> 00:09:01.229
Your Kragen's attack
is shut down...

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.938
as is this battle!

00:09:03.938 --> 00:09:05.844
You're getting on my nerves.

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:07.649
And unless you want to be stung,

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:12.030
that is not a place
you ever want to be!

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:20.725
Shark!

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.831
Rio!

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.406
Yuma, her breathing's
getting worse.

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:27.245
We're running out of time.

00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:29.151
You gotta tough this out, Shark.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:32.328
Rio needs you!

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.876
(Shark)
Rio...

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:44.233
(Shark)
The poison...
it's too powerful.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.172
Rio, I'm sorry.

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:50.218
I don't think I have the
strength to keep fighting.

00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:51.924
Come on...

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.328
Hey, Shark...

00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:57.708
It's lucky for Rio I'm
not a lazy bum like you.

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.715
Brace yourself, jelly face!

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:04.831
'Cause you're about to
get squashed big time!

00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:06.938
I draw!

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:09.346
Since I have under
2,000 life points,

00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:13.759
I can activate the spell
card Puppet Ritual!

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:17.171
I get to summon one
Gimmick Puppet monster

00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:19.913
from my graveyard.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.427
Welcome back, Gimmick
Puppet Giant Grinder!

00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:30.278
You can bring back all
the monsters you want,

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:33.288
but there's no way you
can defeat my monsters!

00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:35.596
I wouldn't bet on
that if I was you!

00:10:35.596 --> 00:10:38.873
I tribute Gimmick Puppet
Giant Grinder to summon

00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:42.183
Gimmick Puppet Nightmare!

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:46.464
But this Nightmare's twice as
scary because it counts as

00:10:46.464 --> 00:10:49.173
two monsters when I Xyz Summon!

00:10:49.173 --> 00:10:52.349
You can do it, Quattro!

00:10:52.349 --> 00:10:53.519
Quattro...

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:58.870
I overlay my two Gimmick
Puppet Nightmares!

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:04.221
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:10.005
I Xyz Summon Number 40:
Gimmick Puppet of Strings!

00:11:19.402 --> 00:11:21.643
Maybe we can still
pull this off.

00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:23.983
Gimmick Puppet of Strings
has the power to take that

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:28.698
slimeball and all
his monsters down!

00:11:28.698 --> 00:11:29.568
Nice try.

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:31.574
I activate the trap Jelly Bind!

00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:33.681
And guess what it can do?

00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:36.791
Since I have a Water
Attribute monster on my field,

00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:39.633
your Gimmick Puppet of
Strings can't attack

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:43.010
or use its special abilities!

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.952
Very clever.

00:11:55.952 --> 00:12:00.500
Now your pathetic Puppet's
as worthless as a rag doll.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.145
I'm placing one card facedown
and then ending my turn.

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:07.790
And while we're speaking
of worthless rag dolls,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.598
how's Shark?

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.350
My jellyfish poison must be
all through his body by now.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.028
Feeling shaky, Sharky?

00:12:20.597 --> 00:12:22.235
Get back up!

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:25.111
The jellyfish has
finally proved it's more

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:28.121
powerful than the shark.

00:12:28.154 --> 00:12:29.558
No!

00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:32.267
(Quattro)
Shark...

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:32.869
You quitter!

00:12:32.869 --> 00:12:36.147
You're no better than that
gutless jellyfish over there!

00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:37.116
Get a backbone!

00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:40.627
Stand up and fight
to save your sister!

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.499
On your feet, Shark!

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:43.670
Hey, that's enough!

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.148
Shark would do anything to
help save his little sister!

00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:48.686
You don't know him!

00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:51.160
You're wrong, Yuma!

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.666
I know Shark.

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.672
I know him better than anybody.

00:12:54.672 --> 00:12:57.748
I was the one who set him
up so he'd get thrown out

00:12:57.748 --> 00:12:59.320
of the finals.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.330
And I was the reason
Rio got hurt.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.299
I'm to blame.

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:04.637
And I know I can
never undo that.

00:13:04.637 --> 00:13:08.315
I'll never forget or forgive
myself for what I did to his

00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:09.753
poor sister.

00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:11.324
I know your friend.

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:12.428
And I respect him.

00:13:12.428 --> 00:13:14.000
He's fought very hard...

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.076
always putting his sister
ahead of himself.

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:18.782
He always sticks up for her.

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:20.688
And you better
not stop now, Shark!

00:13:20.688 --> 00:13:23.932
Don't you dare think
of giving up on Rio!

00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:26.707
This is no time to lie
down on the job when it

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:27.810
isn't finished, Shark.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:33.027
So pick yourself up and
do what you have to do!

00:13:33.696 --> 00:13:37.006
Save your sister, Shark!

00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:41.320
Man...

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:46.403
How can a guy get any rest
with all that yelling?

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:47.339
You're getting up?

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:53.091
Yeah, that proves one
of us has a spine!

00:13:54.496 --> 00:13:57.806
All right, Shark, let's finish
this duel so that you can go

00:13:57.806 --> 00:13:59.779
back to getting
your beauty rest.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:02.387
This face can't get
any better looking.

00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:04.427
(Shark)
Hang on, Rio.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.698
Hang on.

00:14:05.698 --> 00:14:06.634
My turn.

00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:10.613
I draw!

00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:15.128
Alright, I activate
the spell Sea Lord's Amulet!

00:14:15.128 --> 00:14:18.472
Now you can't use spells,
traps or special abilities

00:14:18.472 --> 00:14:22.150
against my Water monsters!

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.528
Next, I activate the spell
Edict of Atlantis!

00:14:25.528 --> 00:14:29.038
Any Water monsters I summon
during this turn will gain

00:14:29.038 --> 00:14:29.741
2 Levels.

00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:32.315
And here comes one
swimming along now!

00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:36.797
My great white
delight, Big Jaws!

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:46.795
And due to Edict of Atlantis'
effect Big Jaws gains 2 Levels.

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:51.744
Next I summon Panther
Shark in attack mode!

00:14:51.744 --> 00:14:57.162
Say hello to the feistiest
cat fish in the sea!

00:15:00.672 --> 00:15:03.549
He's got two Level 5 monsters!

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:04.719
Nice.

00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:06.156
It's go time!

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:10.003
I overlay Level 5 Big Jaws
and Panther Shark!

00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:14.349
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:17.928
and Xyz Summon!

00:15:18.094 --> 00:15:23.278
Come on out,
Number 73: Abyss Splash!

00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:37.557
That Number's more
powerful than my Number.

00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:38.560
That's right!

00:15:38.593 --> 00:15:39.998
And for what you did
to me and Rio,

00:15:39.998 --> 00:15:43.910
you're about to
witness its wrath!

00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:49.495
Quattro, let's win this.

00:15:49.495 --> 00:15:50.464
Yeah.

00:15:50.464 --> 00:15:52.437
You punks shouldn't be so cocky!

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:54.678
I still have a few
tricks up my tentacles

00:15:54.678 --> 00:15:57.386
that you know nothing about!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:02.107
You punks shouldn't be so cocky!

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:04.781
I still have a few tricks
up my tentacles that

00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:06.520
you know nothing about!

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.464
I activate the trap Jelly Hole!

00:16:09.464 --> 00:16:13.543
All your face-up cards
lose their effects!

00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:17.322
Now I'll show you pathetic
amateurs how to really

00:16:17.322 --> 00:16:18.158
finish a duel!

00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:22.304
I activate Number 4: Stealth
Kragen's special ability!

00:16:22.304 --> 00:16:26.083
Not only does your water monster
Abyss Splash wind up sleeping

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:29.427
with the fishes permanently,
but your life points get hit

00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:32.135
by the total number
of its attack points!

00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:35.412
So say bye-bye to
your Abyss Splash!

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.352
That's not gonna happen.

00:16:37.352 --> 00:16:38.054
What?

00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:43.170
'Cause I activate the spell
card Cascade Barrier!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:48.387
It protects Abyss Splash
from destruction!

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:56.246
However, Abyss Splash loses
all of its attack points.

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.723
You may have dodged
my Stealth Kragen,

00:16:59.723 --> 00:17:01.930
but you're not
avoiding my Kragen Spawn!

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.143
I activate its special ability
to destroy Abyss Splash,

00:17:06.143 --> 00:17:07.281
for real this time!

00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:10.892
You're lucky it had no attack
points or you would've lost

00:17:10.892 --> 00:17:11.360
already.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.002
But no biggie, it's
just a matter of time.

00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:17.614
You lost the only monster
you had to protect yourself!

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:20.623
I activate the trap
Celestial Strings!

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.867
This time, the puppet is the
puppeteer as my Gimmick Puppet

00:17:23.867 --> 00:17:29.317
tugs the strings and pulls Abyss
Splash out of the graveyard!

00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:41.823
That was some
incredible teamwork!

00:17:41.823 --> 00:17:42.493
Oh, yeah!

00:17:42.493 --> 00:17:45.468
Next, Gimmick Puppet of
Strings becomes Abyss Splash's

00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:47.977
Overlay Unit!

00:17:50.752 --> 00:17:54.765
I activate Abyss Splash's
special ability!

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.671
I use one Overlay Unit to double

00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.818
Abyss Splash's attack points!

00:18:00.818 --> 00:18:04.161
But why stop at one when
I can use another and double

00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:07.238
its attack points again?

00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:11.536
It's too powerful...

00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:13.074
I can't stop it!

00:18:13.074 --> 00:18:14.478
Abyss Splash attack!

00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:16.987
Take out Stealth Kragen!

00:18:16.987 --> 00:18:18.625
Let's go!

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:21.267
Final fall!

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:55.074
(woman)
Her heart rate and
blood pressure are both

00:18:55.074 --> 00:18:56.111
back to normal.

00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:57.315
This is incredible.

00:18:57.315 --> 00:18:59.689
I don't understand it.

00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:00.592
Yuma...

00:19:00.592 --> 00:19:01.628
Rio is okay!

00:19:01.628 --> 00:19:03.602
All right!
Hey Shark!

00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:05.943
Rio's totally in the clear!

00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:08.985
She'll be grateful when
she learns who saved her.

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:13.098
I hope you took notes on how
a duel's supposed to be played.

00:19:13.098 --> 00:19:13.701
You're joking.

00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:16.743
All I learned from you is people
should mind their own business.

00:19:16.743 --> 00:19:20.456
There's no reason to be ashamed
just because you couldn't win

00:19:20.456 --> 00:19:21.124
on your own.

00:19:21.124 --> 00:19:22.695
Those two argue more
than you and Astral...

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:25.772
I never needed
your help!
Oh, please!

00:19:25.772 --> 00:19:28.614
Yeah, you're right...

00:19:28.614 --> 00:19:30.989
That rotten punk kid...

00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:34.600
I know I've met him before.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.316
I remember now!

00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:44.332
That time, years ago, when
the cops were chasing me...

00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:45.970
I lost control.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.712
I slammed into that car.

00:19:48.712 --> 00:19:50.284
But I saw...

00:19:50.317 --> 00:19:53.126
I could never forget
that face but...

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:54.965
That kid couldn't be you!

00:19:54.965 --> 00:19:55.367
Hold up.

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:57.641
What are you babbling about?

00:19:57.641 --> 00:20:00.081
There's no way it can be you.

00:20:00.081 --> 00:20:01.654
There's no way!

00:20:01.654 --> 00:20:04.328
Hey, come back!

00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:08.174
What couldn't be me?

00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:13.958
(Shark)
No!

00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:16.032
It can't be...

00:20:16.032 --> 00:20:21.416
I saw the same symbol
everywhere in those memories!

00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.088
That means...

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:25.195
Everything okay?

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:27.034
(Shark)
My family's crest...

00:20:27.034 --> 00:20:29.037
and the crest of
that royal family...

00:20:29.037 --> 00:20:31.105
they're the same!

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:32.807
What's wrong?

00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:35.743
(Shark)
That means...

00:20:35.743 --> 00:20:38.446
I'm a...

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.082
Barian!
