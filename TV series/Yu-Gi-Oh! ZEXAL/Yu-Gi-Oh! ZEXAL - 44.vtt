WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.640
Last time on yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.120
VETRIX: Finally the
moment has come!

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.720
I will drain Hart's power
from him and make it mine!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.520
My plan for revenge can
at long last be fulfilled!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.800
With my new Power, dr.
Faker will have no chance!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.480
KITE: Are you the ones
who took my brother?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.080
Where is he?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.400
Quattro: If you want to save the
kid, you don't have any choice!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
You'll have to get
past us first.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
Astral: This will be...

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.760
a tag team duel!

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.480
TOGETHER: Let's do this!

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.680
Puppet of strings, cut
galaxy-Eyes down to size!

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760
Celestial slash!

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.960
YUMA: Please Kite...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
we can't let quattro win!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.480
Think of what'll happen
to your brother.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.400
Hart: Kite, please help me!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.840
Just hang on, Hart!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.160
I will save you!

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.400
Here, Kite!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.360
You can use my power!

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.720
Trey: He's up?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.160
Neo galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon,
blast machu mech with ultimate

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.680
photon stream of destruction!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.920
Rey, no!

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.160
Now,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.440
I'm gonna take you
down, quattro!

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.200

Yeah, we did it, Kite!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.880
Orbital 7: Yeeeeah!
They won! Victory!

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.840
This is... embarrassing.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.640
We just lost. We lost!

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.240
What's wrong?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.440
You okay?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.480
Master Kite!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.280
You're finished.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.800
Now tell me where Hart is.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800
Where's my brother?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.920
Sorry.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.880
All of a sudden,
I can't remember.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.160
Okay, I gotcha.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.680
Well maybe you won't talk,
but your soul will!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:05.360
What's this?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.440
Aaaagh!

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.320
I cannot recover their numbers.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.640
Astral!

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.720
What?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.560
What was that just now?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.840
Is that...

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.120
what happened?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720
I am not sure.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.480
Heh, nice try.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.200
But this crest that
we bear protects

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
us from your little tricks.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.600
You can't touch us!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.120
You and your little Buddy
May've lucked out this time,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.360
but... what?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.440
No, not...

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.040
TORI: Whoa, he vanished!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.440
Who is that being?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.600
Come, Trey.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.200
It's time to go home.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.040
Where's my brother?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.440
Tell me...

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.160
Trey, come.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.280
Where have you taken Hart?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.640
No!

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.640
Get back here!

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.320
Where did they go?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.440
They just...

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.480
they vanished!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.520
Hart...

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.520
QUINTON: Your brother
is right here.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.600
Hart!

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.280
Are you okay?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.960
Hart, talk to me.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.720
Hey, I remember you.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.480
You're that guy from the tower.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.880
I'm Hart's friend.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.280
I'm here to help.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.680
Wait. Uh... hang on...

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.080
Hart will be perfectly
safe with me, I assure you.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.280
Let's go.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.840
So, uh... who's side are
you supposed to be...

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.560
what's going on?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.880
What've you done with Hart?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.800
Don't hurt him!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.640
Hart, what did they do to you?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.200
Master Hart.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.720
Who are you?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.360
What did you want with
my little brother?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.720
That's a simple question
with a very complex answer.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.600
Perhaps another time.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.640
You should know that after all
he went through, he still had a

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.960
little strength left but,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.040
he chose to give it to you.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.480
What?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.840
Here, Kite!

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.760
You can use my power!

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.640
You mean he's like
this 'cause of me?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.200
You've got a lot of
explaining to do, pal.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.000
Start talking!

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.040
It's you again. You're as
persistent as your father.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.200
Huh?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.880
What do you know
about my father?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.600
Your father is alive,
yuma. He's in astral world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.880
What if that guy was
serious back there?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.760
What do you mean my
dad's in astral world?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.640
Is that where you're from?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.120
Is he there right now?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.280
Wait, hang on!

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.040
Tell me what you meant by that!

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.640
Have you seen my dad?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080
Can you take me to him?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.040
Wait!

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.000
Don't leave!

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.240
Astral world. Hey wait a minute,
if that's where you're from,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.920
does that mean you
might know my dad?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.080
I do not know.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.080
I have no memories of him.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.040
So then maybe one of the
numbers we don't have yet has a

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.120
memory of my dad. We've gotta
gather as many as we can.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.240
Why do you even
hunt numbers anyway?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.760
Well, answer me!

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.560
I do it because
it's the only way

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.760
I can save my little brother.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.080
Hart isn't well.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.360
But if we get the numbers,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.160
Kite won't be able
to make Hart better.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.840
But if what Hart said
at the tower is True,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.800
I'm on a mission to
destroy astral world.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.280
And if my dad really
is in astral world,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.240
then that would mean...

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.200
aaaargh, this stinks!

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.520
I dunno what to do, it's
like no matter what happens,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.120
things are gonna end badly!

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.640
Wait a sec!

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.920
One thing at a time!

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.120
I know where my dad might be!

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.040
Astral world, here I come!

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.920
I'm comin', dad!

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.840
Hey!

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.920
Yuma, wait!

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.840
Hart!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.520
Where are you taking him?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.640
Nistro: Calm down!

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.240
Go for a walk or something.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.880
Move it.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.800
You know I can't let you
past these doors, Kite.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.480
So you're not gonna move?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.440
Alright then, guess we're
doin' this the hard way!

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.320
Dextra: Back off, Kite!

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.800
You have to trust
Mr. Heartland.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.760
He'll do everything he can.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.680
I know that you're concerned
about your brother Kite, but...

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.080
you can't help him now.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.360
Tell me, why didn't you
inform the rest of us when you

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.320
discovered that the
original number had

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.240
aligned with yuma tsukumo?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.840
You know about that?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.360
We do.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.680
Well don't you worry.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480
I plan on dealing with him.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.800
"dealing with him?"

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.640
you two just had a tag duel
like a couple of chums.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.120
I hear you did well together.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.040
I will deal with him, Kite.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.680
Leave him to me.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.280
You do not wanna
get in my way, nistro.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.480
Bad things will happen.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.720
Dr. Faker: Oh Hart,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.960
I can't help but fear that this
state you're in is all my fault!

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.440
Dear boy...

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.600
Mr. Heartland: Rest assured

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.680
Dr. Faker, my people are
doing everything they can.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.760
Who did this to him,
Mr. Heartland?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.080
Tell me, who took his power?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.360
According to Kite's report,
it was the work of a group of

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.920
individuals bearing
a powerful crest.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.480
A crest?

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.320
Whoever they are, they will no
doubt show themselves in the

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.680
duel carnival finals.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.480
And when they do, I want you
to make them pay for this!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.840
I don't care how you
do it, heartland!

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.880
But you must recover
Hart's power!

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.600
Yes sir.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.320
You do not know how
to get to astral world.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.920
That occurred to me.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.880
But, when he disappeared,
my dad was looking for

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.240
the edge of the world.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.040
So that's what I'm gonna do!

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.240
And what about the numbers?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.400
What about helping
me recover my memories?

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.760
C'mon, don't try to guilt me.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.640
It's just, he's my dad.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.160
I've gotta bring him back.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.680
Alright, let's do this!

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.240
KARI: So what's
in the bag, yuma?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.320
Are you finally
doing your laundry?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.280
You're probably not
gonna believe me.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.040
But there's something
you need to know.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.760
Is this about dad being in some
alternate universe or something?

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760
Yeah, Tori told
me everything.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.280
So what, you're gonna
go to this other world?

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.440
False.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.160
Now just go back inside.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.280
Look, as much as I'd love to sit
and explain all this, I can't.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.760
And now if you'll excuse me...

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.040
later!

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.600
Yuma, wait a sec!

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.720
Don't worry dad, I'm gonna find
you, no matter what it takes.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.560
Roku: So, does this mean you're
giving up on the duel carnival?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.880
Who's there?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.760
Up here!

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.360
Long time no see, yuma!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.000
Master roku!

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.520
It's been like forever since you
kicked my Butt in the sanctuary.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.600
How have ya' been, old-Timer?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.920
You have the look of someone
who's running away from

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.720
something. What are you
running from, yuma?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.720
Well...

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.640
I wanted to see what my
promising young pupil was up to,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.640
so I came down
from the mountain.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.120
I expected to find you
giving the duel carnival all

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.240
you've got.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.760
Little did I know
that you were facing

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.400
such a difficult situation.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.480
Oh great, so it sounds
like you understand.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.360
I'll be going now.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.760
Not so fast!

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.440
I hereby challenge
you to a duel!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.120
Thing is, I'm really not in a
dueling mood right now, so uh...

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.360
what?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.880
I am your dueling master!

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.640
And my request
will not be denied!

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.280
If you think you're ready to
do what you're about to do,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.200
then prove it.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.040
Alright, let's do this thing.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.200
I cannot lend
you any assistance.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.880
I think you need
to do this alone.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.120
I don't need any
help proving myself!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.000
Bring it!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.080
You asked for it, gramps!

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.760
Duel Disk go!

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.320
Duel gazer Let's roll!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.400
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.040
Let's duel!

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.320
I can feel Hart's power
beginning to awaken inside me.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.080
It's my turn!

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.920
I draw!

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.120
nice, that's what
i was lookin' for!

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.600
I'm summoning gagaga girl!

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.680
How do ya' like them
apples, old timer?

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.120
My field is loaded with
monsters ready to attack!

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.360
I can end this right now.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.680
Gagaga girl is
leading the attack!

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.240
Gagaga charge!

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.520
Now, everybody!

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.400
Attack!

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.080
I reveal my trap card!

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.440
Mirror force!

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.680
You destroyed them. All of them!

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.240
You were so impatient to end

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.960
this that you didn't
stop to strategize.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.520
Yeah well, I've still got
the advantage, old-Timer.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.960
I end my turn!

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.120
Hmph,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.200
let's look into
that "Advantage."

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.600
Interesting.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.400
Seems I'll be summoning
queen's Knight in attack mode.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.160
And now I'll summon the
king's Knight to join his queen.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.440
Now the virtuous
couple is United,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.080
But the royal court
is not yet complete!

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.240
When King's Knight and queen's
Knight are both on the field, I

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.880
can summon another Card
directly from my deck.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.600
Time to make way
for Jack's Knight!

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.160
Not good.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.240
I activate polymerization!

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.280
With this spell, their powers
fuse together to give rise to

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.960
the defender of the
imperial throne!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.880
Arcana Knight joker!

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.840
It's got thirty-Eight
hundred attack points?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.800
Seriously?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.520
You thought you
had the advantage,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.200
but you were blinded
by your impatience!

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.560
This Duel is over. Arcana Knight
joker attack yuma directly!

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.920
Yuma!

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.840
C'mon!

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.960
Let's duel again!

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.280
No!

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.520
What are so you
impatient for, yuma?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.320
In your current state,
you could never defeat me.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.040
Right now you're a fool!

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.520
All impulse and no thought.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.520
It's just that, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.120
If I help astral,
Hart gets hurt.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.200
But if Hart's trying
to destroy astral world

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.200
and my dad's there, then...

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.440
so you decided you would
run away from your problem?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.000
It's not that.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.240
Running off to find your father
is certainly brave in theory.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.080
But with you not knowing where
to even start looking, really it

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.480
seems you're just running off.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.240
And look at all you'd be
abandoning - Your dueling, the

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.480
carnival, your friend astral.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.080
All that you've been
fighting for and training for.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.200
I think you're scared
to face your problem.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.520
But yuma, I want you
to look at your feet.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.640
Those feet are firmly
rooted in dueling.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.040
You can't just
walk away from it.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.040
No more than you
could outrun yourself.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.920
Dueling is the bond
between you and your father.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.800
You must trust that the path of
the duelist will lead you to the

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.960
answers you seek.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.840
Okay, Yeah.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.080
You're right!

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.800
I can totally do this,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.760
I just gotta take it
one duel at a time!

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.080
This power!

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.680
It's like nothing
I've ever felt before!

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.480
Even with the crest, I'm having
a hard time controlling it!

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.640
Hope you're ready, Dr. Faker.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.880
Soon, I will ruin you with
the very power you so desire.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.240
Your end is coming.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.240
So the guy who's put this
whole duel carnival together.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.880
Do you know anything about him?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.880
Every light casts a shadow.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.040
Every puppet has a puppeteer.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.120
That is what I know.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.280
Huh?

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.160
Mr. Heartland is just a face.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.280
He's a smile and a voice,
but he is not the words.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.520
Are you saying there's some
secret mastermind who really

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.040
calls the shots?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.080
The man who's said to have
built heartland city

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.840
was a brilliant scientist
named Dr. Faker.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.560
And what's his story?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.360
His story is pretty
much a mystery.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.080
Is he still here?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.560
Has he moved on?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.600
Nobody knows much about him
and that is most likely how

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.160
Dr. Faker wants it to be.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.800
He did leave one time.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.560
Your father led him
on an expedition.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.280
In fact, it was your
father's last expedition before

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.360
disappearing.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.240
Your father, Dr. Faker, and Mr.
Heartland are all connected.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.360
This cannot be written off
as mere coincidence, yuma.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.760
astral's right.
i have to keep going.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.240
i have to win
the duel carnival.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080
What?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.720
That boy just now?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.080
Yes.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.880
Yuma tsukumo has teamed
up with the original number.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.440
Did you say tsukumo? As
in kazuma tsukumo's son?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.000
Yes.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.440
It can't be.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.200
That's impossible.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.440
that figure I saw at
the end of our duel.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.880
i'm certain it was him. The
envoy from astral world.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.160
but what's yuma's
connection with him?

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.520
Yuma tsukumo...

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.640
it's time to find
out more about you.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.960
Choosing that card makes

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.160
choosing the one
before unnecessary.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.680
You mentioned that!

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.840
But I want both cards in my
deck, so both cards it is!

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.880
Well then at least protect
it with that trap card.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.520
Which trap card?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.280
That one right there.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.080
Let's win this thing, astral.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.880
That is the plan.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.320
Speaking of plans, you
got one for roku's snoring?
