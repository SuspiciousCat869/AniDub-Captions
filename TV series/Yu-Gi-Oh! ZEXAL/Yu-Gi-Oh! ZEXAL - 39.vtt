BRONK: Well, sorry
if I made ya worry.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.060
But me and Caswell are
totally fine, you guys!

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.660
And, since he's safe at home
now, he's gonna stay fine, too.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.030
Yuma: Well good!

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.430
That's a relief!

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.160
FLIP: I guess that leaves
yuma as the only one of us

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.030
left in the carnival.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.530
Astral: Your
friend flip is right.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.630
Only the very best
duelists now remain, yuma.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.330
And so...

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.760
so, I need to be at my best!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
TORI: Wait, not everyone we
know is out of the tournament.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.030
Cathy: Tori is right.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.230
After all,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.560
I'm still in.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990
You scared me!

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.760
Sorry, didn't mean to sneak up.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.690
But check it out.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.860
Whoa, looks like you have
two heart pieces there, cat!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.930
I happen to have
four of them myself.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.330
Let's not make this
about you yuma, please?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.530
What?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.960
When do I ever do that?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.090
Well, I guess sorta
all the time, huh?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.790
Yeah, no 'sorta' t it.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.530
But that's just you, yuma.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.490
Guess ya can't have the
Candy without the wrapper.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.090
Hey!

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.260
Stop!

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.660
That's not a Chew toy!

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.460
Sit! Stay! Heel!

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.590
Looks like the only command
those mutts follow is 'fetch.'

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.990
what are you going to do?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.530
Without those heart pieces...

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.130
I know, I won't be able
to make it into the finals

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.290
of the world Duel carnival!

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.730
Meooooowwww!

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.960
Hey!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.660
Where'd these cats come from?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.190
They're friends of mine.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.760
And they're gonna get
back what those dogs stole.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.760
Meowww!

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.760
I've just always sorta had
a way with the feline kind.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.930
Yeah,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.590
it's almost like you
speak their language.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.290
Actually Tori,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.030
not 'almost' I do.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.130
Litterbot: Trash
identified, trash identified.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.530
Good job!

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.860
Let's go, they
found those dogs.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.160
Uh, okay...

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.790
we found them, what now?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.030
Simple.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.190
We take back what's yours!

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.490
And we do so with back up!

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.830
Don't worry,

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.160
they're all bark and no bite.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.790
You sure about that?

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.390
Now be good little pups,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.830
and give up the heart pieces!

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330
ROSCOE: Make way
for the pack Leader!

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760
Now what's all this about?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.330
That dog's talkin?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.690
No way.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.960
What's this here?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.830
Someone's heart pieces?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.360
You stole this, didn't you?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.930
You're bad boys.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.190
You are all bad boys!

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.430
Uh...

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.960
could someone tell me
what's happening here?

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.660
Yeah, how's that big dog
know about heart pieces?

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.890
I don't typically beg
but in this case I will.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.790
Please, accept my
apology for any

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.660
trouble my pack may
have caused you.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.290
Aw, it's cool.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.130
You thieving mongrels!

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.930
Those Mutts should all be
kept on a very short leash!

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.330
Now now,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.490
they've been disciplined,
so let's just move on.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.990
I've tried moving on,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.760
but this stuff
just keeps happening!

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.360
Take that shiba
for example.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.990
He's been stealing steaks
from the town butcher.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.390
And that pug over there has been
digging holes all over the city.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.130
Plus his face looks funny, and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.830
he won't stop sticking
his tongue out at me!

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.360
How dare you!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.760
Cats are worse than us!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.160
They sleep all day,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.260
they scratch up anything
they can get the claws on!

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.790
That's enough!

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.190
to settle this,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.890
we need to have a duel!

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.730
Have a duel?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.760
Sounds like a fine idea.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.360
But if I win,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.830
then all you dogs have to leave
the city once and for all!

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.090
And if I win,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.560
you cats beat it.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.060
Forever.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.390
Aw, this stinks.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.860
I like cats and dogs!

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.860
And I just want my pieces back!

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.660
This takes precedence, yuma.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.860
Cats and dogs
are age old rivals.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.790
Finally they have
a chance to settle it.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.690
What about what I want settled?

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.190
Like getting my heart pieces!

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.660
Duel disk,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.490
let's go!

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.790
Duel Disk,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.390
get set!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.490
Duel gazer, let's roll.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.460
Computer Voice: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.620
Let's duel!

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.960
I've heard of it
raining cats and dogs,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.690
but not dueling them!

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.690
I just hope Cathy wins
for my heart pieces' sake!

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.190
I'll start off!

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.630
So here goes!

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.890
First I summon stray cat!

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.530
Only a hundred attack points?

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.030
That stray cat's clawless!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.160
That is True,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.960
and that may be the plan.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.030
Those mutts will be licking
their chops to get to stray cat.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.490
but when they do attack,
they're gonna have another

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.590
thing coming.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.590
I now place two cards facedown.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.930
Then I'll end my turn.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.760
It's time to let
the dogs out now!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.590
That dog can draw?

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.330
Now I've seen it all!

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.590
You ain't seen nothin'
yet, I summon tribulldog!

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.460
And when tribulldog is unleashed
out in my yard, I'm allowed to

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.030
summon another one from my hand!

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.990
But that's not the only trick I
know. Next I play doubulldog!

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.290
Thanks to this spell card, when
there are two tribulldogs in my

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.360
yard, this card lets me summon

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.230
another tribulldog from my deck!

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.160
That's three level 4 monsters!

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.590
Here we go.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.030
I now overlay this
threesome of tribulldogs,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.390
and since I have,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.030
I can now build
the overlay network!

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.490
Which means things are
about to get really Ruff!

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.090
I xyz summon sumo King dog!

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.490
How does a dog know
how to make that play?

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.190
I mean, an xyz summon?

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.960
I just learned how to do that
move myself and it wasn't easy!

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.660
When it comes to dueling,
between that dog and yuma,

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.860
I would say the dog
is better trained.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.090
So not cool!

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.730
go on fido, take the bait!

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.830
and Let the cat out of the bag.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.930
Next up I play this:

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.690
The spell card pooch party!

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.160
This lets me summon two pooch
party tokens out to my yard!

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.530
And next, I activate
the equip spell dogking!

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.890
Go!

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.830
And Since dogking will be joined
up with Sumo king Dog, my sumo's

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.230
attack points go up 500 points

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.560
for every dog in my yard!

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.230
I've got three, so that's a
power boost of 1500 points!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.230
Talk about a bite
as big as your bark!

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.690
I just hope that pooch isn't
hungry for my heart pieces!

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.190
And Now, go!

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.260
Attack That little stray!

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.460
Ha, she's not even
going to see it coming!

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.260
I play a trap card!

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.330
Cat confusion!

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.460
But there's no
confusing what it does.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.190
Now, since your monster
attacked my cat, your attack is

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.530
negated, and your monster
returns to your hand.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.560
I've been more confused chasing
my own tail than by that card.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.590
I play sumo king
Dog's special ability!

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.760
Now, by using One overlay unit,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.260
I can negate and then
destroy your trap card!

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.890
That is an
extraordinary ability.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:09.890
This is not gonna be pretty!

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.130
Oh No, Cathy!

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.760
That card's gone to the dogs.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.190
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.330
Before I took sumo
king Dog's attack,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
I played this!

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.090
My facedown, cat food.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.830
Thanks to this
scrumptious spell,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.230
by tributing stray cat,
I can summon stray cat girl!

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.360
And When stray cat girl
is in attack mode,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.730
she can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.190
What difference
does it make?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.760
You only have
500 life points left.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.730
You've been all but declawed!

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.890
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.560
Now that my turn is over, my

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.360
pooch party tokens
are destroyed.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.790
My turn then!

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.530
And for you fleabag,
it'll be cat-Astrophic!

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.690
Flea bag?

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.990
I just had a bath!

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.030
Here I go!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.230
Draw!

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.730
Sure you knocked me pretty good
last round, but now you'll see

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.890
why cats always
land on their feet.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.590
I summon cat GIRL!

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.460
Next, I'll overlay it with
my other level 4 monster.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.630
And now that I have, I can build

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.190
the overlay network and xyz
summon cat girl MAGICIAN!

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.890
Next I activate the equip
spell catnip turbine!

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.730
And with it, I'll be nipping at
your life points because this

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.460
card increases the attack points

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.630
of one of my
cats by 1200 points.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.330
What a purr-Fect move!

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.230
Now cat girl magician is
the strongest on the field!

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.560
But the drawback to
this spell is that my cat

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.030
can't attack your monsters.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.690
So then what's the point,
it's useless to you!

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.690
That's not quite so.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.190
I'm now activating cat
girl magician's ability!

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.030
With it, by using One overlay
unit, and halving her attack

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.130
points, cat magician can attack

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.330
you directly!

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.290
She can wha?

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.630
Now, go cat magician!

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.690
Attack With Cataclysmic
Clobbering blast!

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.560
Aw Yeah!

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.530
I now place two cards facedown,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.490
and end my turn.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.060
Which means cat magician's
attack points return to normal!

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.630
And speaking of cats, that
was one cat's meow of a turn!

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.630
Well it's gonna be nothing
but the dogs days for you as

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.390
this duel goes on,
no way am I gonna

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.960
roll over and keep taking this!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.960
PIP: No way am I gonna roll
over and keep taking this!

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.360
You hear me?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.090
I'll make ya sorry!

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.690
Where'd she come from?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.470
Who? me? Oh...

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.090
huh?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.830
What in heartland city
is going on here?

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.160
Seriously!

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.790
Did that girl just
come out of that barrel?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.060
Does this mean,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.990
that girl was dueling
the whole time?

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.260
Guess that makes more
sense than a dueling dog.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.090
Then that would mean,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.790
the dog is not better
trained than yuma.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.830
However, that little girl is.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.290
So not cool!

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.490
Hi there,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.830
it's okay.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.430
What's your name?

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.360
Pip.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.830
Pip.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.290
Speak up!

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.560
I said my name's pip!

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.530
Is that loud enough?

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.290
Well, pip.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.660
Would you mind...

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.260
telling us why you're
pretending to be a dog?

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.290
That's easy.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.590
You see,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.590
dogs are the most loyal
animals there are.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.460
And loyalty is super
duper important to me.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.190
Because you can't
always count on people.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.830
They can be mean.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.430
But I can always
count on my dogs.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.030
In fact, that's how I learned
to duel in the first place.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.130
Roscoe and I would practice
on the beach all day long!

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.660
That's how he
learned how to draw cards!

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.430
And that's how he learned
how to make sense

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.190
of the cards that he saw!

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.260
We became a team!

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.590
And since I didn't want to
be hurt by any mean people,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.890
I just thought,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.630
well, it'd be easy,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.460
to keep on dueling other
people as a team, too.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.090
That's when

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.330
I started hiding in the barrel
and using this phony deep voice.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.860
But not all people are mean.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.430
We humans can be loyal too.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.390
You'd learn that if you
stopped hiding behind that dog.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.790
See?

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.890
You're not even
giving us a fair chance.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.290
Cathy's right!

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.890
Don't bother, yuma.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.790
Sounds like this pack has
made up pip's mind for her.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.590
Yep, it sounds like she's
never going to duel for herself.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.290
Go hide in the barrel, pip!

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.330
No!

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.560
You're wrong!

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.730
If I'm wrong,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.890
then prove it!

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.390
By Not hiding anymore!

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.860
Duel Disk set!

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.760
We're ready to go!

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.430
Then so are we!

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.830
Simply amazing...

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.060
a duel that was about
dogs and cats,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.430
is now about a little girl
coming out of her shell.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.060
It's my turn now!

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.360
I draw!

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.760
First I play a spell card,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.030
one that's gonna make you howl!

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.890
Go raise the woof!

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.290
Now, since I have no level
3-Or-Above monsters in my yard,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.360
I'm allowed to summon
four woof tokens!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.860
And with more dogs in play,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.790
sumo king Dog GAINS
more attack points!

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.660
2000, and all thanks
to my dogking's effect.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.990
Now sumo,

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.560
rise to the air,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.360
and attack cat Girl magician!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.030
I play a facedown!

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.430
The trap, gold
coins for cats!

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.730
And Now, since
you attacked my cat,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.290
half your monster's attack
points are added to my

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.230
magician's attack points.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.590
Five thousand,
seven hundred fifty?

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.960
Now she's got
more than that sumo!

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.190
That is True,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.190
but you are forgetting
one thing yuma.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.290
I play sumo king
Dog's special ability!

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.590
Now, by using One overlay Unit,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:48.560
your trap's effect
will go Bye-Bye!

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.960
Not good.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.690
Cat magician's back to
her normal attack points!

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.590
And that's just what I wanted.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.760
After all, sumo king Dog May be
able stop a trap, but it can't

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.760
stop a spell.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.030
Like my second facedown card,

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.430
and here it is!

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.130
Counter meowsure!

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.060
Now, since my trap
was destroyed,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.560
I get to have revenge,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.360
and can destroy
a trap or a spell

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.990
that's on your field!

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.490
And then,

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.360
the attack points of one
of the cats I have out

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.330
are doubled for
the rest of the turn!

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.490
Doubled?

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.860
Oh no!

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.790
And now for the spell or Trap
card that I'll destroy

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.230
I select...

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:35.960
the spell dogking so now sumo's
attack points return to 2600!

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.960
Then my cat girl magician's
attack points increase to 6400!

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.390
And you do know what
that means, don't you?

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.860
Now,

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.790
you and your dogs are through!

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.230
she's right.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.690
i'm gonna lose.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.330
guess I should've never
come out of that barrel.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.330
guess I should've just
stayed away from people.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.260
What's the hold up, pip?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.890
You feeling like quitting?

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.390
No!

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.290
You can't give up, pip!

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.930
Keep On dueling!

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.130
You can win!

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.590
Trust me!

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.960
Yeah, yuma's right!

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.230
Don't quit now!

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.730
You've gotta keep
fighting 'til the end!

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.960
Yeah, be loyal to your cards.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.590
Just like your dogs
are loyal to you.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060
Yeah.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.290
They're right.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.630
I've gotta stay loyal!

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.360
There's still some
fight left in this dog!

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.730
And I know there's
fight left in all of you!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.930
I play my trap card,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.960
superior howl!

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.490
With This, by destroying one of
my equip spells, I can return

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.130
all monsters on the field to

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.960
their original attack points.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.660
They say that every dog
has its day, young lady.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.630
And I think this one is yours!

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.990
Now go!

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.430
Sumo, take out cat magician!

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.560
Huh?

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.190
I won?

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.030
Yaaay!

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.890
That's what I'm talking about!

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.730
Way to go!

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.530
Wait, what about
my heart pieces?

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.290
I used to think only a
dog could be my best friend.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.030
But now I know better.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.160
Hey,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.430
it's my heart pieces!

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.190
At last! Thank you!

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.630
One Good deed

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.430
deserves another one.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.790
Take these.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.190
But, they're yours!

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.890
They were tyou beat me!

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.290
Really?

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.160
Absolutely, pip.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.630
Guess cats and dogs can
be friends after all.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.060
Which makes sense,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.460
because deep down,
we're not all that different.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.060
See, I used to
be like you, pip.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.960
Afraid of people.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.160
But when I came out of my shell
like you came out of that barrel

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.590
and started dueling,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.330
I realized that people
weren't all bad.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.430
And I even started
to believe in myself.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.430
I guess I am feeling
more confident.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.930
That's so cool.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.360
All thanks to dueling.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.630
And look there.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.330
Guess this town's big enough For
both cats and dogs after all.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.430
Let's just hope people
pick up after their pets!

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.560
observation #18:

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.730
people say
 "a dog is a man's best friend."

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.660
yuma would make a good dog.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.430
All right, time to feel the flow
and get my last heart piece!

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.360
Watch out carnival,
'cause here comes Yuma!
