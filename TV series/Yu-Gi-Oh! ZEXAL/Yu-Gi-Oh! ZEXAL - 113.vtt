WEBVTT

00:00:00.593 --> 00:00:04.330
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal..."

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.332
Looking snazzy, Heartland.

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:09.001
You just need one
final accessory

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.336
to complete your ensemble!

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.340
Stop at nothing to seize
Yuma Tsukumo's Numbers!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.911
I'll even give you an evil
entourage as backup!

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:21.347
Yuma Tsukumo!

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:23.816
Thanks for coming.
Heartland!

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:26.619
What have you done with
Tori and the others?

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.187
He didn't do a thing!

00:00:28.187 --> 00:00:30.056
I deserve all the credit.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.858
I was feeling
some hunger pangs,

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:34.227
so I feasted on your
buddies' memories.

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.829
Who are you?
I'm Erazor.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.697
You'll have to battle me

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.932
if you want to get your
friends' memories back.

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:41.667
But if you lose,
I get your Numbers!

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.704
Astral trusted me to
hold onto the Numbers

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:45.905
and keep them safe,

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.341
and I'm not letting him down!

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.843
Way to tell'em, Yuma!

00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:53.980
It's Trey!

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.348
What're you doing here?

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:57.984
I know that no one
can replace Astral,

00:00:57.984 --> 00:01:00.319
but I'll give it my best shot.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.788
Tray, take these.

00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:03.656
My Number cards!

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:06.659
Astral trusted me to take care
of the Numbers,

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.827
which means he also trusted

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:09.795
that I would know what's
best for'em.

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.330
(all) Let's duel!

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.966
Now that you're dueling
on enemy ground,

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.002
Erazor's got the upper hand.

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.970
Especially since
I gave him the power

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.607
to absorb half of
your life points.

00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:24.343

After you lose to me,

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.181
I'm gonna feast on
your memories,

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.350
just like I did
to your friends!

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.353
And to make sure that happens
as quick as possible,

00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:41.587
I'm changing the rules

00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:44.991
so that I'm allowed to attack
on the first turn.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.791
You cheat!

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.994
You can't do that unless
we agree to it!

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:49.695
Just watch me!

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:53.332
I summon Oily Cicada!

00:02:54.333 --> 00:03:00.339
And watch it call one of its
buzzing buddies: Dream Cicada!

00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.678
And all the special abilities
aren't over yet,

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.814
because Dream Cicada lets me
switch Oily Cicada

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.182
into defense mode!

00:03:10.182 --> 00:03:11.884
And here's the slick part.

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:13.352
When Oily Cicada
is in defense mode,

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:17.290
it counts as two monsters
when I use it to Xyz Summon!

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.358
This is bad!
That's right!

00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:23.162
I overlay both Oily Cicadas
and Dream Cicada!

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:27.800
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.306
I Xyz Summon Number Three:
Cicada King!

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.607
Erazor has a Number?

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:37.343
Caught you both by surprise,
didn't I?

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.912
Vector gave us this Number
just for this duel

00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:43.349
so that I could finish off
Yuma once and for all!

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.718
He'll be pleased to know
that I also used it

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:48.187
to get rid of you, too, Trey!

00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.355
Now, Number Three,

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.357
you've been lying low
for long enough.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.662
The time has come to rise up
and spread your wings!

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.332
But why'd he summon it
in defense mode?

00:03:59.332 --> 00:04:01.867
I thought that bug brain was
gonna attack on this turn!

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.203
Careful. There's no telling
what he'll do.

00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:07.640
Just be ready to swat down
whatever flies our way.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.609
You can try, but you will fail.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.744
It's your move.

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:14.246
Get set to get decked!

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:15.681
Hyah!

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.616
(thinking) Double or Nothing.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:21.020
I used this the first time
I met Astral,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.621
when I was battling Shark.

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:25.358
I remember that duel
like it was yesterday!

00:04:25.358 --> 00:04:28.327
We teamed up together
and found a way to win.

00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:31.163
Astral may not be floating
by my side right now,

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:34.233
but I'm gonna make him proud,
no matter what.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.336
Face it, kid, without Astral
to babysit you,

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:38.104
you haven't got a chance.

00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:41.874
Heartland, why don't you make
like a heart and beat it!

00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:43.943
I've got a duel to win!

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:47.913
I summon Gagaga Magician!

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:55.755
And now that I've summoned
a Level Four monster,

00:04:55.755 --> 00:04:57.056
I can also summon this!

00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:00.693
Come on out of the shadows,
Kagetokage!

00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:03.329
(thinking)
This one is for you, Astral.

00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:11.303
I overlay my Level Four Gagaga
Magician and Kagetokage!

00:05:11.337 --> 00:05:15.074
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:20.346
I Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:27.353
(evil laugh)
It won't be around for long.

00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:29.355
(thinking)
Hope I'm doing
the right thing.

00:05:29.588 --> 00:05:33.292
If only Astral were here
to butt in and help.

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:36.328
No! I have to go
with my gut.

00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:39.799
And my gut's telling me to
activate the spell

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.234
Reservation Reward!

00:05:42.234 --> 00:05:45.104
If I show you a spell card
in my hand,

00:05:45.104 --> 00:05:47.740
I can place it facedown
on my field.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.610
So take a nice, long look
at Double or Nothing.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.346
Why would you want that card?

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:55.147
Simple.

00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:57.349
If I can manage to activate
Double or Nothing,

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.352
it'll double my Utopia's
attack points!

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:02.354
Not only that,
when Utopia attacks,

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:05.724
you still take damage even
if your Cicada King

00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:07.092
is in defense mode.

00:06:07.092 --> 00:06:08.561
(thinking) If this works,

00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:11.764
the damage to Erazor
will be devastating.

00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:12.965
Yuma may have lost Astral,

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:15.968
but it's clear he hasn't lost
his nerve.

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:19.305
He's still totally
feeling the flow.

00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:20.005
All right.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:25.344
Utopia, it's time to exterminate
that Cicada King!

00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.847
But first I'll use
one Overlay Unit

00:06:27.847 --> 00:06:31.784
to put a stop to that attack!

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:36.288
Go, Light Wing Shield!
I don't think so!

00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:39.859
By using one Overlay Unit,
I activate Cicada King's

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:44.296
special ability to negate
Utopia's special ability!

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:47.800
Go, Overlay Absorption!

00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:50.169
No way!

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.773
Now Utopia's got to
continue its attack!

00:06:54.773 --> 00:06:56.342
But that's not
the worst of it!

00:06:56.342 --> 00:06:58.277
Cicada King's special ability

00:06:58.277 --> 00:07:01.347
boosts its defense points
by 500!

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:04.917
Your strategy backfired.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:08.053
Utopia's in a world of hurt!

00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:22.311
Utopia's in a world of hurt!

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.451
You okay?
Yeah, that was no big deal.

00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:30.953
I hardly felt anything!

00:07:30.953 --> 00:07:33.689
That bug's all buzz
and no bite!

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:34.690
We got this!

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:36.592
Nice work, Yuma.

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:38.628
You just wasted
500 life points.

00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:41.430
The poor sap doesn't
have a clue what he's doing!

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.599
He was nothing but
a puppet all along.

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:46.502
Now that Astral isn't around
to pull his strings,

00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:48.137
the kid is completely lost.

00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:51.040
Keep quiet, Heartland!
It's my draw!

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.178
I'll start off by summoning
Chronomaly Moai Carrier!

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:01.017
And that lets me bring out

00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:03.352
the perfect wingman
for my Carrier,

00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:06.956
Chronomaly Winged Sphinx!

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:13.229
Since there's already
two numbers on the field,

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:14.697
I may as well make it three.

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.234
I overlay my Level Five
Chronomaly Moai Carrier

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:21.003
and Chronomaly Wings Sphinx!

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.707
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:28.711
I Xyz Summon the megalopolis
of monsters,

00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:33.683
Number 33: Chronomaly
Machu Mech!

00:08:33.683 --> 00:08:36.052
This duel is ours.

00:08:36.052 --> 00:08:39.155
All right!
We've got him out-Numbered!

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.423
I'm not impressed.

00:08:40.423 --> 00:08:42.558
That Number's too weak
to hurt a fly,

00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:44.660
much less my Cicada King!

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.695
Not for long!
Huh?

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:47.930
I'm activating the spell card

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.568
Chronomaly Pyramid Eye Tablet!

00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:54.337
Uhh!

00:08:56.405 --> 00:09:02.311
It powers up my Chronomaly
Machu Mech by 800 points!

00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:06.682
Machu Mech, unleash your
special ability!

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.986
Anytime the attack points
of a monster change,

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:11.687
Machu Mech can use
an Overlay Unit

00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:14.957
and deal out damage equal
to the point change.

00:09:14.957 --> 00:09:17.526
Brace yourself to get blasted.

00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:19.195
Hey, wait, Trey.

00:09:19.195 --> 00:09:21.163
Don't forget his monster
can...

00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:21.697
Too late!

00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.700
Once again, you've managed to
make my Number even stronger!

00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:27.136
Cicada King uses
an Overlay Unit

00:09:27.136 --> 00:09:29.372
to activate its special
ability!

00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:32.541
It not only gains another
500 defense points,

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:37.079
but it also negates Machu Mech's
special ability!

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:39.482
The harder you go after
my Number,

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:41.617
the more invincible it grows.

00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:43.552
We've dug ourselves
into a hole,

00:09:43.552 --> 00:09:45.054
and it just keeps
getting deeper!

00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:47.289
You're forgetting about
the spell card

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.257
you left on the field.

00:09:48.257 --> 00:09:51.160
That can help us
turn this duel around.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.694
Huh?

00:09:51.694 --> 00:09:55.965
I activate Reservation
Reward's effect!

00:09:55.965 --> 00:10:00.970
It lets me place my spell
Heart of Stone facedown!

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.140
Machu Mech, zap that
Cicada King!

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.443
You're attacking?
That makes no sense!

00:10:07.443 --> 00:10:10.446
You'll only hurt yourself!

00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:17.053
Trey, no!

00:10:18.454 --> 00:10:21.090
You knew that attack
wouldn't work!

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.292
So why did you do it?

00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:27.196
Because the effect of
Reservation Reward

00:10:27.196 --> 00:10:30.699
lets me activate the spell
Heart of Stone!

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.702
Since Cicada King wasn't
destroyed,

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:38.140
Heart of Stone lets Machu Mech
attack again.

00:10:40.976 --> 00:10:44.680
But this time, Erazor, it's
attacking with more fury,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.681
because Reservation Reward

00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:48.350
doubles Machu Mech's
attack points!

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.020
You played all those
cards perfectly.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.688
I'm sorry I ever
doubted you, Trey.

00:10:52.922 --> 00:10:56.192
Machu Mech, what do you say
we try this again?!

00:10:56.192 --> 00:11:01.697
Exterminate that Cicada King
with Meteor Meltdown!

00:11:06.068 --> 00:11:08.404
(rumbling)

00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:12.208
Ha! I play the trap
Cicada Illusion!

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:18.347
Your meteor is crushing a mirage
instead of my monster!

00:11:18.347 --> 00:11:20.015
It's safe?

00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:23.385
You may have managed to save
your Cicada King,

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:26.589
but your life points are
a different story!

00:11:27.256 --> 00:11:28.691
Erazor!

00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:29.625
Awesome!

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.127
You thought we were weak,

00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:34.163
but together, Yuma and I
can't be beat!

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:35.297
With the battle over,

00:11:35.297 --> 00:11:37.700
Machu Mech's attack points
return to normal.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.069
You losers better enjoy
your luck,

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:42.071
'cause it's about to change
for the worse!

00:11:42.071 --> 00:11:44.707
If you're trying
to intimidate us,

00:11:44.707 --> 00:11:46.709
it won't work.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:47.710
Doesn't matter!

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.979
The fact is you and
your pal Yuma

00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:53.616
just bought a one-way ticket
to the disaster zone!

00:11:53.616 --> 00:11:56.085
I switch Cicada King
to attack mode!

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:59.355
Get ready to strike
at my command!

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.492
And here's some extra buzz.

00:12:03.492 --> 00:12:06.962
Thanks to Cicada Illusion,
my monster's defense points

00:12:06.962 --> 00:12:08.697
are added to its attack points,

00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:13.169
giving my Cicada King a
3,500-point bug bonus.

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:14.036
(evil laugh)

00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:15.971
I'll grind both of you
into dust,

00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.340
starting with the weakest link
first!

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.611
I've got your Number in my
sights, Yuma Tsukumo!

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:26.415
Cicada King, finish this!

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:28.551
What a mismatch!

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:31.287
Utopia's about to be
destroyed!

00:12:31.287 --> 00:12:33.163
And so are you!
Ha ha!

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.556
Cicada King, finish this!

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.125
What a mismatch!

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:43.061
Utopia's about
to be destroyed!

00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.564
And so are you!
Ha ha!

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:48.299
Don't think so, Heartland!

00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:52.337
I play a trap!
Orichalcum Mirage!

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:55.306
Now Cicada King's attack
gets re-directed,

00:12:55.306 --> 00:12:59.344
so my Machu Mech takes
the hit instead!

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:07.552
Aah!

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:09.354
Trey, no!

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.493
That meddling malcontent
saved Yuma!

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:16.628
Trey!

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:19.597
Thanks for taking the hit
and saving me.

00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.933
No need to say thanks, Yuma.

00:13:21.933 --> 00:13:25.370
But your life points
are down to 200.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.272
I came here to protect you,

00:13:27.272 --> 00:13:30.375
and that's what I intend
to keep on doing

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:32.277
to my very last point.

00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:34.212
Thank you.

00:13:37.882 --> 00:13:38.950
(evil laugh)

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.185
You think you've saved Yuma?

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:44.189
But all you've done is guarantee
that you'll both be doomed!

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:45.190
What?

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.525
Just watch and see!

00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:51.062
I activate the trap
Final Cicada!

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:55.233
All I have to do is send this
card to the graveyard

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:56.134
on my next turn.

00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:58.937
Then the 1,500 points
of damage you just took

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:02.607
will return to strike you
all over again!

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:05.910
You two thought you could
beat me.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.312
Who's the bug brain now?!

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:10.615
You can go ahead
and take your last turns!

00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:12.584
Or you can just give up!

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:14.319
No, never!

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:16.287
I draw!

00:14:16.287 --> 00:14:16.621
(groans)

00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:20.158
(thinking)
There must be a way to turn
this duel around

00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:21.626
with the cards I have!

00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:22.627
Come on! Think!

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.631
It doesn't matter what move
you make, Yuma!

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:30.468
I have an itty-bitty trap
called Cicada Force

00:14:30.468 --> 00:14:32.337
waiting for you.

00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:34.205
The second you attack me,

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:36.140
Cicada Force will activate,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.913
forming a barrier that destroys
all your monsters!

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:45.016
(thinking)
I can't see a way out.

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:46.618
Maybe it is over.

00:14:46.618 --> 00:14:48.353
Yuma.
Huh?

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:51.623
We believe in you, Yuma.

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:53.625
Don't give up.

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:55.560
You can still win.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.194
Go for it.

00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:58.396
They're talking?
Impossible!

00:14:58.396 --> 00:14:59.631
You slurped up their memories!

00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:03.134
Their brains should be
vacationing in Zeroland!

00:15:03.134 --> 00:15:03.635
What happened?

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:05.069
Don't you guys get it?

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:07.639
Yuma and his friends
are tougher than you think!

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:10.074
You're about to find
that out the hard way.

00:15:10.074 --> 00:15:11.609
(thinking) Trey's right.

00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:14.612
We are strong enough
to stand up to Erazor...

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:18.149
even without Astral's help.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.021
Erazor, this duel's
doing a 180!

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:23.988
Get set.

00:15:23.988 --> 00:15:26.190
We're about to high five
the sky.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.125
Oh!

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.626
I'm activating the spell

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.928
Release, Reverse, Burst!

00:15:30.928 --> 00:15:33.931
Now by sending an Xyz Monster
to the graveyard,

00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:38.536
your facedown spells and traps
are all destroyed!

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:39.070
Oh!

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.639
So I send my Number
to the graveyard!

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:45.443
I'm sorry to lose you, Utopia!

00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:50.548
You've only postponed
your fate.

00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:54.485
The instant my next turn
begins, this duel ends!

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.988
Thing is we're still
on my turn,

00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:58.956
and I'm summoning
Gillagillancer

00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:02.060
directly to Trey's field!

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:09.300
For the gift that
I gave to Trey,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.568
he's gonna have to pay me back

00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:14.472
by giving me 500 of his life
points at the end of his turn.

00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:17.475
Your teammate only has
200 life points left?

00:16:17.475 --> 00:16:21.612
You're willing to sell him out
to preserve yourself?

00:16:21.612 --> 00:16:22.830
I like it!

00:16:24.498 --> 00:16:27.100
Your teammate only has
200 life points left?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.371
You're willing to sell him out
to preserve yourself?

00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:32.439
I like it!

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:34.508
It's your turn, Trey.

00:16:34.508 --> 00:16:35.642
You betrayed your friend!

00:16:35.642 --> 00:16:39.779
Now he'll turn against you in
a desperate attempt to survive!

00:16:40.013 --> 00:16:40.580
I won't!

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.350
That isn't how friendship
works, Erazor!

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.718
Yuma and I are
in this together,

00:16:44.718 --> 00:16:47.587
and I'll prove that
to you now!

00:16:47.587 --> 00:16:49.789
Here I go!

00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:50.524
Hyah!

00:16:50.524 --> 00:16:52.759
(thinking)
Yuma just put a card
facedown.

00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:55.529
I think I know
what he has in mind.

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:57.030
I'll begin my turn

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.267
by activating the spell
Orichalcum Chain!

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:03.537
And guess what that
lets me do, Erazor.

00:17:03.537 --> 00:17:05.672
I can Xyz Summon
using one monster.

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:08.542
And thanks to Yuma,
I have the monster I need.

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:10.777
That's what I call teamwork.

00:17:10.777 --> 00:17:11.578
Yeah!

00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:14.481
Gillagillancer, let's do this!

00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:16.783
Thanks to Orichalcum Chain,

00:17:16.783 --> 00:17:18.385
I can overlay this one Monster

00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:21.521
to build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:24.791
Step forward, Number Six.

00:17:28.728 --> 00:17:31.464
Chronomaly Atlantis!

00:17:32.032 --> 00:17:34.334
And now that I've summoned
Atlantis,

00:17:34.334 --> 00:17:36.403
it can equip a Number
in the graveyard

00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:39.773
and power up by gaining all
of its attack points!

00:17:39.773 --> 00:17:42.609
I thought Yuma was trying
to save himself,

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:43.743
but I had it all wrong!

00:17:43.743 --> 00:17:47.113
He sent Number 39 to
the graveyard to help Trey,

00:17:47.113 --> 00:17:50.584
so that he could gain
Utopia's points!

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:54.454
(Trey)
Talk about awesome teamwork.

00:17:54.454 --> 00:17:58.758
Now we have the power of two
Numbers packed into one.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.162
There's more!

00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:03.697
My spell Pyramid Eye Tablet

00:18:03.697 --> 00:18:07.667
gives Atlantis an 800 point
power up!

00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:13.106
Not bad, but not good enough
to defeat me this turn!

00:18:13.106 --> 00:18:14.307
So that means when I'm up,

00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:17.744
you're your both going down
once and for all!

00:18:17.744 --> 00:18:19.312
Don't think so, Erazor.

00:18:19.312 --> 00:18:22.649
Atlantis, attack Cicada King!

00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:26.119
Do it, Yuma!

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:28.655
I activate a trap card!

00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:29.789
Overlay Stopper!

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:33.159
It puts a stop
to Trey's attack!

00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:37.030
Why stop your own
teammate's attack?

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.432
Because it lets us play this...

00:18:39.432 --> 00:18:40.300
Double or Nothing!

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.402
Now Atlantis can attack again

00:18:42.402 --> 00:18:44.671
but with twice
the attack points!

00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:46.306
And then I'll follow up Yuma

00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:49.109
by activating
Reservation Reward!

00:18:49.109 --> 00:18:53.413
Atlantis' attack points
get doubled again!

00:18:54.581 --> 00:18:56.383
This can't be!

00:18:56.383 --> 00:18:57.784
There must be some mistake!

00:18:57.784 --> 00:19:00.787
The only mistake
is the one you made

00:19:00.787 --> 00:19:01.588
when you challenged us.

00:19:01.588 --> 00:19:06.192
Atlantis, it's time to
de-throne that Cicada King!

00:19:06.192 --> 00:19:09.763
(Yuma) Vaporize that bug!

00:19:21.775 --> 00:19:24.778
Aah!

00:19:24.778 --> 00:19:27.781
No! Erazor!

00:19:34.487 --> 00:19:38.525
I won't forget this, Yuma!

00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:41.094
Huh?

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:45.065
What's going on?
I can't remember.

00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:45.765
Me either.

00:19:45.765 --> 00:19:49.035
Didn't we come here
to solve a mystery?

00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:51.571
Yuma!
What's up, guys?

00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:52.772
When did you get here?

00:19:52.772 --> 00:19:54.774
I didn't expect
to see you.
Oh, Yuma!

00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:56.776
You guys are amazing!

00:19:56.776 --> 00:20:00.547
You cheered me on even when you
were all unconscious.

00:20:00.547 --> 00:20:03.516
You guys totally rock!

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.585
You, too, Trey.

00:20:05.585 --> 00:20:07.787
I got this, thanks to you,

00:20:07.787 --> 00:20:09.522
and I want you
to hold on to it.

00:20:09.522 --> 00:20:12.525
Are you sure?
This is a Number card.

00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:15.061
Take it as a sign
of our friendship

00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:17.697
and of my trust in you.

00:20:17.697 --> 00:20:18.765
Thanks, Yuma.

00:20:18.765 --> 00:20:20.467
I'll take good care of it,

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:22.335
and that's a promise.

00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:25.605
(thinking) Astral,

00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:28.108
I wish you could've seen
my duel today.

00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:30.076
I was so broken up
that you were gone,

00:20:30.076 --> 00:20:32.112
I almost gave up on everything.

00:20:32.112 --> 00:20:35.448
But now I see that with
my friends beside me,

00:20:35.448 --> 00:20:38.118
anything is possible.

00:20:38.118 --> 00:20:42.455
Still, I miss you.
