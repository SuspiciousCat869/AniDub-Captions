WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.390
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.360
VETRIX: Good.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.430
We can start the ritual now.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.790
Finally the moment has come.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.360
I will drain Hart's power
from him and make it mine!

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.760
My plan for revenge can at
long last be fulfilled!

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.730
With my new power, Dr.
Faker will have no chance!

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.360
KITE: Are you the ones
who took my brother?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.890
Where is he?

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.790
QUATTRO: If you want to save the
kid, you don't have any choice!

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.760
You'll have to
get past us first.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.390
Astral: This will be...

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.560
...a tag team duel!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.760
TOGETHER: Let's do this!

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.460
Be afraid, quattro!

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.960
Come Forth,
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.060
Attack Giant grinder!

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.590
Kite Fell for it!

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.260
TREY: I activate the trap

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.890
stonehenge shield!

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.260
If you attack with a monster
with 3000 or more attack points,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.760
this card not only deflects your

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.790
attack, but your
monster's attack points

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.690
Get zapped down to zero!

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.230
And it loses all of
its special abilities!

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.360
They set him up.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.930
Go infinity Cannon!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.860
Now say goodbye to your
Dragon's attack points.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.990
And get ready... to say
good-bye to your life points!

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.360

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.330
This is the end of
the line for you, Kite!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.390
I play the trap
courageous heart!

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.330
By giving up half my
life points, I'll stop

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.690
machu mech's special ability
this turn and save Kite!

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.230
Save me?

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.930
TORI: Oh no!

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.760
The sooner we get rid of
that kid the better.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.330
Yuma's completely unselfish.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.590
Astral.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.030
Are you okay?

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.430
It is nothing.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.690
Focus on winning the
duel, and saving Hart.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.690
Why did you save me?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.290
It's like I said,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.760
I'm keeping the promise
I made to your brother!

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.290
Rescuing Hart is my job.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.190
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.360
Hey!

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.090
It wouldn't hurt to say
thank you once in awhile!

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.860
Orbital 7: Please
cut him some Slack.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.460
He's super-Stressed
about his brother.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.030
Hart: Kite!

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.090
Kite, where are you?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.390
Here you go.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.790
Thanks, Kite.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.160
That's the most amazing
butterfly you've ever caught!

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.430
Yes, I've tapped
into Hart's memories.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.090
It looks more like a jewel
than a bug, doesn't it?

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.430
Hey Kite, since you caught
this butterfly for me,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.890
is it okay if I free it?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.290
But why?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.230
It's just that this
butterfly was made to be free.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.530
And I don't think it could
ever be happy locked in a cage.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.390
That is logical.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.790
You're right, Hart.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.230
Let it go.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.200
Thank you, Hart. Soon all
your memories will be mine.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.830
Hart!

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.960
Come on!

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.430
Make your move already!

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.930
Why the rush?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.130
It's not like Hart's
in too much danger.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.260
Quit stalling, quattro!

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Don't push them too far.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.830
Too far, Trey?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.790
If you're too soft for this job,
then maybe you should leave.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.630
Quattro...

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.760
well?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.360
You dueling or not?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.230
Let's continue!

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.530
I activate the spell,
chronomaly pyramid eye tablet!

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.960
With this card's effect, I can
increase the attack points of

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.890
all my chronomaly
monsters by 800!

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.960
And now I'll use machu
mech's special ability!

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.330
Since Its attack points changed,
I can use one overlay unit to

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.890
deal 800 points of damage!

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.760
Get set, machu mech!

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.660
Go Infinity Cannon!

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.530
Excellent work, Trey!

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.890
Now target Kite!

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.460
Attack!

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.990
Go, machu mech!

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.690
Destroy galaxy-eyes!

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.130
Torch him with meteor meltdown!

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.860
With your photon Dragon's attack
points already down to zero,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.830
your life points are history!

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.330
It's over, Kite!

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.790
So long!

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.990
Watch out!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.860
I activate battle simulation!

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.890
With this trap, our monsters
lose half their attack points

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.560
and can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.930
Your monster might be safe,
but your life points aren't.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.360
Impact alert!

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.090
Kite!

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.330
Are you okay?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.230
Yes.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.360
You're hurt.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.960
I'm fine.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.190
I can still duel, and beat them!

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.730
Oh, please, it's hopeless.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.160
You can't save your brother, but
there's still time to chicken

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.360
out, and save yourself!

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.560
That does it.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.730
Wait Kite,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.930
just cool off!

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.430
My brother's in danger.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.830
You don't know me or
what I'm going through!

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.460
You're wrong!

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.790
I do know!

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.390
And here's why!

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.530
I know you because I
dueled against you before.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.460
And Kite, I know
you're a great duelist!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.590
I saw then how brave
and skilled you are.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.190
But I could also see
you have a great spirit.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.730
We can save Hart,
by dueling as a team!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.190
Not for revenge,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.860
but as friends
who won't give up!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.390
We just have to believe that
we can high-Five the sky!

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.060
Together, we'll feel
the flow and win!

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.390
It is your turn, yuma.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.660
This draw is crucial.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.360
Make it count, my friend!

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.090
You got it, astral!

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.790
I draw!

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.230
Perfect!

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.960
I now activate
the spell monster reborn!

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.090
Now I can bring back utopia!

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.690
We didn't plan
for this, quattro.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.430
It's time to take this
duel to the next level!

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.860
Let's show them how, utopia!

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.330
Go Chaos xyz evolution!

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.260
Make way for chaos
number 39: Utopia ray!

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.690
No way!

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.330
What's a chaos number?

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.290
Quinton: That boy
Can change his number.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.460
Interesting.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.130
Who is this yuma tsukumo?

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.590
Could it be...

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.930
you... are going down!

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.060
Where'd a twerp like yuma
learn how to do that?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.890
I activate utopia ray's
special ability!

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.090
By Using One overlay unit,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.430
it gets a 500
attack Point power-up!

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.590
Go Overlay charge!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.990
Yuma, machu mech does not have
any overlay units left to use.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.730
But giant grinder has one
overlay Unit and can still use

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.760
its special ability.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.160
If so, we will
lose the battle.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.360
Let us attack, right away.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.790
Okay!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.160
And Since utopia ray's special
ability also gives it the power

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.690
to erase a thousand attack

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.230
points from another monster,
we can weaken giant grinder!

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.030
Utopia Ray, attack!

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.360
Go Rising sun chaos slash!

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.860
Quattro Should be
out of life points.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.260
With this last attack...

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.530
we knocked him out of the duel!

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.630
Alright!

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.460
You did it!

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.190
Sorry, but I survived thanks
to my gimmick box trap card!

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.490
Say what?

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.030
Not only don't I take any
damage, but gimmick box

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.030
transforms into a monster whose

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.260
attack points are equal to
the damage I would've taken!

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.930
I thought for sure we could
beat him with Utopia ray!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.060
He seems to be prepared
for every move we make.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.460
Well maybe this facedown will
make things more difficult!

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.790
Your utopia ray's attack
points are returning to normal.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.690
No monster of yours will
ever be a threat to me.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.060
I'm too good,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.190
and now I'm going to prove it.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.530
I draw!

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.590
I play the spell
card junk puppet!

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.960
With This I can summon a gimmick
puppet from my graveyard if it

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.460
has 1000 attack points or less.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.690
Gimmick puppet dreary doll,
welcome back to the duel!

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.660
Now I can overlay my level 8
gimmick box and dreary doll in

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.260
order to build the
overlay network.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.990
I xyz summon,

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.890
number 40: Gimmick
puppet of strings!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.560
Yuma!

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.890
Oh great!

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.360
How are we gonna beat a number
with 3000 attack points?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.190
Obviously, the answer
is that you can't.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.630
First up,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.190
I think I'll unleash
number 40's fury on Kite!

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.990
Do it, puppet of strings!

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.590
Cut galaxy-Eyes down to size!

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.230
Celestial slash!

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.430
Kite's life points
will be wiped out!

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.890
Hart...

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.000
I failed you!

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.460
It's been nice
dueling you, loser!

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.430
I play trap reborn!

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.490
Using This card, I sacrifice
half my life points.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.890
And now by banishing a trap
in one of your graveyards,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.590
my card gains it's effect!

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.590
I choose Kite's
battle simulation!

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.230
Now Both Monsters lose half
their attack points, and neither

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.460
monster is destroyed in battle.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.790
That means Kite's
still in this duel.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.830
That may be, but Kite
still loses life points!

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.860
He's almost out of points!

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.860
Yuma!

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.360
That attack was perfect
till you botched it up!

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.330
This was supposed to
be my moment of glory!

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.530
You're making me look bad, kid!

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.530
It takes so much courage
to keep giving up

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.530
your life points like yuma has.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.560
You're having a lot of fun
making a pest of yourself, yuma.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.660
But I'm about to become

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.330
a pest exterminator!

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.530
I activate puppet of
strings special ability!

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.460
Prepare to face the music!

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.630
By Using One overlay Unit,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.190
puppet of strings
plays a melody of mayhem.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.690
At the end of your next turn,
all monsters on the field are

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.360
destroyed, and each duelist

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.490
Takes damage equal to
the attack points of the

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.730
monsters that they controlled!

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.190
What's the plan?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.390
The plan is for you to lose.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.460
Your fate is sealed!

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.130
Both you and Kite are
facing utter destruction.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.560
All hope for Hart is truly lost.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.590
I'm pulling all the strings now!

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.690
There's no way you
can save yourselves!

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.790
So?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.630
Are you two going to give up?

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.330
They must both be
defeated during this

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.160
next turn, or we will lose.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.130
Everything depends on Kite.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.930
He must duel.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.260
But how?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.460
He's too weak.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.030
What's wrong Kite?
Lost the will to fight?

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.690
If you don't get up, then Trey
and I will be the winners.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.260
Please Kite...

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.290
get up!

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.990
Come on!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.860
You can't let quattro win!

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.030
Think of what'll happen
to your brother.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.130
Oh no!

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.190
Hart!

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.890
Hart needs me!

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.530
Kite, Please help me!

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.160
Help me, Kite!

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.930
No!

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.060
Come back!

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.160
Hart...

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.690
Mr. Heartland: Hello, Kite.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.290
I assume you'd like to
see your brother again.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.090
That will only be
possible if you show us

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.960
you're a team player.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.930
You will help dr.
Faker, won't you?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.730
Let Hart go now!

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.730
Kite, Please help me!

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.490
Help me, Kite!

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.260
Don't worry, Hart.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.590
I'll get you out of here
no matter what it takes.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.130
Just hang on, Hart!

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.060
I will save you!

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.660
I'll take the memories
of both brothers.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.930
They will prove useful to me.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.690
No, vetrix!

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.590
Those memories belong to us.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.390
I won't let you take them.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.230
Hart!

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.960
How did you get here?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.490
This is worrisome.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.090
The energy matrix
is destabilizing.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.830
Vetrix are you alright?

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.590
My brother has always taken care
of me, no matter what the cost.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.630
He's been my protector.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.030
This time, I'm going
to protect him!

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.160
Here, Kite!

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.230
You can use my power!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.330
Huh?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.260
What's this?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.590
Master Kite!

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.990
He's up?

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.660
What happened to Kite?

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.130
Could Hart do this?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.430
I don't understand.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.830
The matrix was created
from Hart's energy.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.430
Where did it go?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.630
Thanks, Hart.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.960
I know the strength
I feel came from you.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.490
It appears the energy source
that transformed Kite will also

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.560
give new Power to his deck.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.260
Where'd it come from?

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.860
It was created from
the bond between

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.130
Hart and his brother Kite.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.530
Lookin' good, master Kite!

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.890
Look out, quattro!

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.790
Here I go!

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.190
Galaxy-Eyes doesn't
have any attack points.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.160
And you've got
a measly 100 life points!

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.830
How can you hurt me?

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.890
You're as harmless as a fly!

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.960
I'm strong enough
to out-Duel you!

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.690
I've got my brother's strength.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.490
That's all I need!

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.890
I'm gonna start my
turn with a spell card.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.690
Overlay regen!

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.260
Now each xyz monster on the
field gains an overlay unit!

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.090
Listen Astral,
I'll need your help.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.360
So let's try to
work together.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.030
It's the only way
to beat those two.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.390
Yuma!

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.330
What if we give a card
to Kite to help him out?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.730
Awesome!

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.530
In fact, let's
give him two!

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.760
Kite, hope these Can help!

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.090
I tribute utopia
ray and damage mage,

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.730
in order to summon
photon Caesar!

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.160
When I use photon
Caesar to xyz summon,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.230
it counts as two monsters!

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.290
I'm going to overlay galaxy-Eyes

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.460
with my two photon caesars!

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.690
This monster trio is just

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.660
what I need to build
the overlay network!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.990
I xyz summon Neo
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.490
I xyz summon Neo
galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.690
That Dragon got
a major makeover!

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:10.230
I activate neo
galaxy-Eyes special ability!

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.490
Photon howling!

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.130
Whenever galaxy-Eyes is used
to summon neo galaxy-Eyes, the

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.630
special abilities of all the

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.530
other monsters get negated.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.090
That means...

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.660
it'll be Harder to destroy!

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.060
It didn't even need to use an
overlay unit for that move!

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.590
But it will use one for
its second special ability!

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.030
By Using One overlay Unit, neo
galaxy-Eyes absorbs all the

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.460
other overlay units
on the field!

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.160
For Every unit absorbed,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.090
neo gains 500 attack
points this turn.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.130
Plus it gets an extra attack
for each absorbed Overlay unit!

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.760
That's 6,000 points!

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.130
And it can keep
attacking us too!

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.290
Neo galaxy-Eyes photon
Dragon, prepare to attack!

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:59.130
Blast machu mech with Ultimate
photon stream of destruction!

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.160
