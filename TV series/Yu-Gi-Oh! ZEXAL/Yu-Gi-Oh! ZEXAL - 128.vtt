WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.006
(Yuma)
Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL...

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.174
(Girag)
What... You want to get Nash
back to Barian World?

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.342
(Vector) That's right.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.989
Our fearless leader
needs to rule, not to duel.

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.724
You sure about that?

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.292
Just do it.

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:16.926
Hey!

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:18.824
I don't like your attitude!

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:19.573
Is that so?

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:22.740
Well, maybe you'll like it
better after a friend of mine

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.776
has a word with you.

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.911
Say hello to Don Thousand!

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.448
(creepy laughing)

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.753
This makes things a
lot simpler for everybody!

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:41.092
You'll do exactly what
I tell you to.

00:00:41.092 --> 00:00:44.062
(all) Let's duel!

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:47.765
You will never destroy
my Galaxy-Eyes!

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:49.100
Wrong again, Mizar.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.438
I can use Chronomaly Chaos
Atlandis's special abilities!

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.773
That means Chronomaly
Chaos Atlandis

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:59.410
can equip
the monster it battled!

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.246
This cannot be!

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:04.449
Take his Tachyon Dragon!

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:10.822
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:13.424
You may think
you have angered me,

00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:15.927
but all I feel is pity.

00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:16.961
Pity for you...

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:20.798
because your last move has
assured that you two cretins

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:24.969
will suffer an agonizing
defeat at my hands!

Those two brothers!

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:32.437
They stole my Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon,

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:34.739
so that I would not
be able to rank it up

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.909
to Neo-Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.878
They shall pay for
their thieving ways.

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:42.380
This I promise.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.916
Mizar's strategy
was unstoppable.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:47.251
Until they found
the way to stop it.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.688
(Vector) This is unbelievable!

00:02:50.688 --> 00:02:54.292
Mizar's getting outplayed
by two bumbling brothers!

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:56.961
How pathetic and embarrassing!

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.364
Your strongest
card's untouchable.

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:00.331
That's right.

00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:02.433
There's no way you can win!

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:05.303
I admit I underestimated you.

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:09.240
But do not make the mistake
of underestimating me.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.144
I summon Heliosphere Dragon!

00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:22.420
That monster's got
no attack points.

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.722
He must be up to something.

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:28.259
When Heliosphere is the only
monster on my field...

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.428
you are not allowed to attack.

00:03:30.428 --> 00:03:32.363
I see what Mizar's doing.

00:03:32.363 --> 00:03:35.199
He must be stalling for time
until he can figure out a way

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.836
to get Tachyon Dragon back,
but I won't let him.

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:44.008
I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.444
♪♪

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.715
(Yuma) Trey...

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.451
Quinton...

00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:58.356
It's my turn.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.361
First, I activate
the trap card Number Lifter!

00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:06.130
It lets me summon a Number
from my graveyard,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.701
but without
its special abilities.

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:11.436
Now!

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:14.272
Take to the skies once more!

00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:18.876
Number 9, Dyson Sphere!

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:30.421
Next, I activate
the spell card Rank-Up Return!

00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:33.991
This card lets me get one
Rank-Up-Magic card

00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.427
back from the graveyard.

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:38.429
So I'm getting back

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:45.303
and activating Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force!

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:52.109
I overlay Rank 9 Dyson Sphere!

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:57.014
With this monster, I rebuild
the Overlay Network!

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.653
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.827
Rise, Chaos Number 9:
Chaos Dyson Sphere!

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:29.247
Careful...

00:05:29.247 --> 00:05:31.148
Any monster that battles
Dyson Sphere

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:33.451
becomes its
Overlay Unit!
What?

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.822
And once per turn, it can deal
you 500 points of damage

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:41.959
for every one
of its Overlay Units!

00:05:43.027 --> 00:05:43.427
He's smart.

00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.898
His tactics are tight and
his skills polished.

00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:47.965
You're right.

00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:49.367
I misjudged this human.

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:52.036
Let's hope Mizar
did not as well.

00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:55.039
That is one nasty,
ginormous monster.

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.441
(Mizar)
Your monster
may be impressive,

00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:59.343
but it is useless to
you now, Quinton.

00:05:59.343 --> 00:06:03.447
As long as I have Heliosphere on
my field, you cannot battle me.

00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:08.386
Right now, Chaos Dyson
Sphere has one Overlay Unit.

00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:11.022
With that infinitesimal
bit of damage,

00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.691
it will take you a
hundred turns to beat me.

00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:17.161
You're wrong, I'm going
to do it in just one!

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:17.962
No!

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:19.430
I think you're
forgetting something.

00:06:19.664 --> 00:06:23.267
Our other Chaos Xyz Monster
has some special abilities

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:25.303
of its own.

00:06:25.303 --> 00:06:26.237
What?

00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:27.004
Allow me to explain...

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.441
Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis will
now use three Overlay Units

00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.444
to reduce your
life points to 1!

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:47.425
(groaning)

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:53.030
(Mizar) Unthinkable!

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.433
How could I let mere
humans reduce me

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:59.437
to a single life point?

00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:01.772
Mizar will punish
them for that!

00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:03.708
Mizar, you must
be in Mizar-y!

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:06.711
Now Chaos Dyson Sphere's
special ability will wipe out

00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:08.179
the rest of your life points!

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:11.449
Chaos Dyson Sphere,
bury that Barian!

00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:15.386
Wipe out his
remaining life point!

00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.423
Consider this
final move payback

00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:23.394
for what you miserable Barians
did to our brother, Quattro!

00:07:23.394 --> 00:07:26.397
Oh and Mizar,
we wanted this last blast

00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:29.734
to pack a bit of extra punch,
as a painful reminder

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:34.438
of what we think of your
''great" Barian leader, Nash!

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.020
(Orbital 7)
All systems
fully operational.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:55.087
314.25 seconds until launch
preparations are complete!

00:07:55.087 --> 00:07:55.620
Master Kite!

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.124
I am picking up massive energy
spikes at the exact location

00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.494
where Quinton
and Trey are dueling!

00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:04.696
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:06.998
Pay it no mind...
Keep working.

00:08:06.998 --> 00:08:09.601
Aye-aye.

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:16.441
We did it, Quinton.

00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:18.643
One Barian down, six more to...

00:08:18.643 --> 00:08:20.979
(gasping)

00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:25.083
How did he survive that blast?

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.120
He still has a life point!

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.888
Yes, fool.

00:08:29.888 --> 00:08:31.890
How can this be?

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.724
It is simple.

00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:36.428
The trap Damage Rebound
activated when I took damage

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.731
due to a special ability.

00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:43.135
It blocked all the
damage I would have taken!

00:08:43.135 --> 00:08:44.903
That is not all.

00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:46.972
You have to select a
card on your field

00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:48.440
and return it to the deck.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.976
And if the card you chose
is a monster card,

00:08:50.976 --> 00:08:54.112
you take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:08:54.112 --> 00:08:57.115
But we only have monster
cards on our field!

00:08:57.115 --> 00:09:02.120
And they're both strong enough
to drop our life points to zero,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.790
so it doesn't matter
which one we choose!

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.490
We'll still lose!

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.761
Actually Trey we do have
one more card in our possession.

00:09:09.761 --> 00:09:11.396
That is correct.

00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:13.999
Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:17.035
When Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon
Dragon is equipped,

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:20.038
it is not considered to
be a monster card,

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:22.908
so you will not take damage.

00:09:22.908 --> 00:09:24.476
Essentially, you have no choice

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:28.146
but to give Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon to me!

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:29.881
He out-played us,
Quinton!

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.550
He was willing to
risk everything

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.118
to get his Dragon back.

00:09:33.118 --> 00:09:34.119
Impressive.

00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:38.824
I have no choice but to return
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon

00:09:38.824 --> 00:09:41.393
to your deck.

00:09:46.097 --> 00:09:47.866
Since I have
Galaxy-Eyes back,

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:50.135
your Chaos Atlandis'
attack points drop,

00:09:50.368 --> 00:09:52.671
along with your
hopes of winning!

00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:53.705
This changed nothing.

00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:54.840
You're still going to lose!

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.511
I activate Chaos Dyson
Sphere's special ability!

00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:06.485
By using an Overlay Unit,
you take 800 points of damage!

00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:13.124
I activate the trap
Damage Alteration!

00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:20.098
With this card in play,
I take no damage.

00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:23.869
So sorry to disappoint you.

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:28.740
Now, I summon a monster that has
the same number of attack points

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.742
as the damage I would
have taken.

00:10:30.742 --> 00:10:35.046
I summon Parsec,
the Interstellar Dragon!

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:45.123
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:52.130
(Girag) Nash!

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.865
Girag!

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:56.067
Save me, Nash!

00:10:57.969 --> 00:10:59.905
Girag, what the...

00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:01.139
(laughing)

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:01.806
Take it easy.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:05.076
I'm just here to stop you
from dueling Yuma.

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:06.144
This is nothing personal.

00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:10.115
I'm just following
Don Thousand's orders.

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:12.584
Don Thousand?

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:14.986
My turn!

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:16.488
I draw!

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:19.858
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
The Seventh One!

00:11:19.858 --> 00:11:23.895
With it, you are one
step closer to your demise!

00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:24.629
Take flight!

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:29.401
Number 107:
Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon!

00:11:29.768 --> 00:11:32.470
And now at long last...

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.541
I overlay Rank 8 Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.745
With this monster,
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.915
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:11:46.384 --> 00:11:50.555
I summon Chaos Number 107!

00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:54.960
Barian power born from chaos,
surge through my Number

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.861
and bestow it with great might!

00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:01.900
Come forth Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:11.509
He has his monster back.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:12.978
And what a monster it is!

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:14.679
I mean look at that thing!

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.047
It's solid raw power!

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.717
All the way up to
its three heads!

00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:21.886
This is the end,
for both of you.

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:29.527
This is the end,
for both of you.

00:12:29.527 --> 00:12:31.129
Just because you say
we're through,

00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:33.131
doesn't mean we are, Mizar.

00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.134
I activate the trap
Monopole Chain!

00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:39.137
As long as I have
my Chaos Dyson Sphere,

00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:42.073
your monster can't attack!

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.819
Next, I activate
the trap Atlandis Invitation!

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:58.089
As long as Chronomaly Chaos
Atlandis is on our field,

00:12:58.089 --> 00:13:00.625
your monster is
destroyed if it doesn't attack!

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:02.694
But the best part is that
you take damage

00:13:02.694 --> 00:13:04.129
equal to its attack points!

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:07.399
Right, and Chaos Dyson Sphere
already made sure

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:08.033
it can't attack.

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:10.535
So it'll be destroyed
at the end of this turn!

00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:14.372
Then I will take damage equal to
its attack points and lose...

00:13:14.372 --> 00:13:17.776
at least that is what
you are hoping, is it not?

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:18.743
Well, forget it!

00:13:18.743 --> 00:13:19.711
That will not happen!

00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:21.680
Because you are
underestimating the power

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.516
of my Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon!

00:13:24.516 --> 00:13:28.486
I activate Neo Tachyon's
special ability!

00:13:28.486 --> 00:13:30.422
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:13:30.422 --> 00:13:33.124
not only do I negate all
your cards' effects,

00:13:33.124 --> 00:13:37.562
but I transcend time and return
all cards to the way they were

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:39.931
at the beginning of the turn!

00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:42.734
Time Tyrant!

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:46.705
What is this?

00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:52.143
I shall put it in a way that
even you can understand!

00:13:52.143 --> 00:13:53.445
Time is rewinding.

00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:57.849
Watch as all the work you
have done has been for naught.

00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:08.626
I'll activate my trap again!

00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:10.061
I bet you would
love to do that.

00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:14.132
But like I said Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon's special ability

00:14:14.132 --> 00:14:17.102
also prevents you from
activating your trap!

00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:18.136
Then that means....

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:19.771
That beating me
is quite impossible!

00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:22.474
But in case there is any hope
left in your heart,

00:14:22.474 --> 00:14:24.776
this next move
will stomp it out.

00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:28.046
By banishing my Heliosphere
and Parsec Dragons,

00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:32.817
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon
can attack three times!

00:14:46.397 --> 00:14:47.532
All systems normal.

00:14:47.532 --> 00:14:52.036
Exiting atmosphere
in 58.03 seconds.

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:55.840
(Kite) Next stop, the moon!

00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:05.116
He's on his way!

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:05.650
He is.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.684
Let me ask
you something, Mizar.

00:15:06.684 --> 00:15:09.954
How does it feel to have been
played like a deck of cards?

00:15:09.954 --> 00:15:12.123
What are you talking about?

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:13.591
Explain yourself!

00:15:13.591 --> 00:15:15.627
We've been keeping you busy.

00:15:15.627 --> 00:15:17.996
So Kite could
head for the moon.

00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:19.130
The moon?

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.100
And he's not the only
one with travel plans.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.437
Yuma and Astral are heading
to Barian World.

00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:29.007
So what's the plan to
win this duel, Quinton?

00:15:29.007 --> 00:15:31.109
I'd say we've already won.

00:15:31.109 --> 00:15:32.610
We did what we set out to do.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.580
Keep Mizar's mind off Kite.

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:42.086
What's that?

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:43.121
Oh my goodness!

00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:44.122
It looks like...

00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:45.523
Quinton and Trey!

00:15:45.523 --> 00:15:48.493
Hey, how come I can see you?

00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:51.129
Time to let the cat
out of the bag.

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:52.597
I've got something to say,

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:56.134
and I want both Yuma and our
friend, Mizar, to listen.

00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:59.838
Everyone, Kite is
headed for the moon.

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:00.705
The moon?

00:16:00.705 --> 00:16:04.876
<i>As to why, well thatbegins with Jinlon.</i>

00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:07.445
See Kite did a little
digging into the legend

00:16:07.445 --> 00:16:08.646
of Jinlon's temple

00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:11.583
and he came up with an
interesting theory.

00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:12.116
What?

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:14.118
I thought gathering the
seven Mythyrian Numbers

00:16:14.118 --> 00:16:15.920
would lead us to
the Numeron Code,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.122
but you're saying
that's not enough?

00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:19.123
That's right.

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:22.760
I went back to Jinlon's ruins
to see if I could find anything

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.128
to back up my theory.

00:16:24.362 --> 00:16:26.898
When I got there, Orbital's
sensors uncovered

00:16:26.898 --> 00:16:31.102
an ancient stone monolith
with a riddle carved on it.

00:16:31.102 --> 00:16:36.140
"Dragons of light and time, born
in the land hidden by light.

00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:41.379
A duel at this unseen
soil will reveal the code"

00:16:43.081 --> 00:16:45.116
So what do you make
of it, Quinton?

00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:47.085
The 'Dragons of light and time'

00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.521
must mean Galaxy-Eyes Photon
Dragon and Tachyon Dragon.

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.924
But where could the
land hidden by light be?

00:16:52.924 --> 00:16:55.393
What's not seen in the day?

00:16:55.393 --> 00:16:56.861
The moon!
That's it!

00:16:56.861 --> 00:16:58.730
I think you might be right!

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.899
I am.

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:02.767
And the last line
of the riddle is

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.471
"A duel at this unseen
soil will reveal the code."

00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:10.608
That means I will have a duel
there with my Galaxy-Eyes!

00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:13.978
Furthermore, I deduced
that the code must be referring

00:17:13.978 --> 00:17:15.546
to the Numeron Code.

00:17:15.546 --> 00:17:17.115
My mission's clear.

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:20.084
Pack your bags
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:22.887
We're headed to the moon.

00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:27.058
The Numeron Code.

00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:29.894
Kite certainly is a clever
boy to have figured out

00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:31.663
all that gibberish by himself.

00:17:31.663 --> 00:17:34.565
And I commend your efforts
for keeping me occupied.

00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:36.634
Too bad that is your final act.

00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:39.938
Yuma, they didn't take
on Mizar for revenge,

00:17:39.938 --> 00:17:42.507
they went to help us!

00:17:42.507 --> 00:17:45.510
Astral, we gotta
go back for them!

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.844
(Quinton) <i>Yuma, no!</i>

00:17:46.844 --> 00:17:49.113
<i>It's all up to you now!</i>

00:17:49.113 --> 00:17:52.116
<i>We fought hard to clearthe</i>
way for your escape.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.118
<i>Don't let us down!</i>

00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:57.689
Can we get this over with?

00:17:57.689 --> 00:18:02.927
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon,
attack Chaos Atlandis

00:18:02.927 --> 00:18:07.131
with Ultimate Tachyon
Spiral of Destruction!

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:16.040
Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon,
attack Chaos Atlandis

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.144
with Ultimate Tachyon
Spiral of Destruction!

00:18:22.146 --> 00:18:24.115
Don't do it!

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.927
Attack Chaos Dyson Sphere!

00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:58.116
All right, Yuma.

00:18:58.349 --> 00:19:00.818
You can do this,
I believe in you.

00:19:00.818 --> 00:19:03.888
This may be our last duel,
but we're behind you.

00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:09.127
And with you every
single step of the way, Yuma.

00:19:09.127 --> 00:19:10.595
No, Trey...

00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:12.130
Quinton...

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.535
Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Tachyon Dragon, finish them!

00:19:26.778 --> 00:19:29.781
(screaming)

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.988
(yelling)

00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:44.462
Master Kite, we
lost their signal.

00:19:44.462 --> 00:19:47.131
Understood, Oribital.

00:19:54.639 --> 00:19:57.041
Good riddance!

00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:18.696
(Dumon)
Are you going
to the moon?

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:19.130
(Mizar) Yes.

00:20:19.363 --> 00:20:25.136
The duel that awaits me has been
a very long time in the making.

00:20:27.138 --> 00:20:28.139
Yuma...

00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:31.476
Yuma, you do not
face your mission alone.

00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:34.145
I am always with you.

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:38.983
I'm just scared
that it won't be enough!

00:23:06.464 --> 00:23:06.864
♪♪
