WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.267
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:07.203
The awesome power
of Barian Chaos

00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:09.505
will leave you
quaking with fear!

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:12.709
It is an unstoppable
force of fury!

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.711
We can do this the easy way

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:15.945
or the hard way...

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:16.946
up to you.

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:20.316
Either way,
the real Shark
will swim again!

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:21.617
You deluded fool.

00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:22.952
I was never your friend.

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:25.455
I never felt anything
for you or anyone else

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.691
except pity at
how pathetic you all are!

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:29.826
Huh?

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:31.394
That's right, Quattro.

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:33.196
Let your anger towards me grow.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:36.566
It makes turning on you
so much simpler.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.736
Symphony of Destruction!

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.511
Aah!...

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:51.314
You look like
the old Shark again,

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:53.649
and that proves that I am
getting through to you!

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.852
It must be our dueling
that's bringing back

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.754
the friend I once knew.

00:00:57.754 --> 00:00:58.955
(growling)

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:02.525
Ugh... so,
is everyone okay?

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:03.426
(all groaning)

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:07.396
Yep, everybody is
absolutely fantastic!

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:10.933
(screaming)

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:15.571
Ugh!

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.877
Today I lost an old friend,

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:23.279
but I've gained a new enemy!

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:24.680
Yes, that's correct!

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.885
One who will destroy you!

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:30.653
It's time, Quattro.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.423
Time for share
your friends' fate.

Quattro's signal's still
coming through okay.

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.460
I just hope that
he's still all right.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.495
Have faith in
your brother, Trey.

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:48.764
We all have to have
faith in him.

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:51.767
There's use
doing anything else.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:52.935
Right.

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:54.937
It's time, Quattro.

00:02:54.937 --> 00:02:56.405
Time to meet the same fate

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:57.940
your friends did.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.676
They couldn't defeat
my fellow emperors.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:03.512
They failed, just as you will.

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:04.780
(growling)

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.815
No way!

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:08.384
I'm gonna take you
and your Barian buds out

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:08.918
one by one!

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:11.787
When I get through with you,
you're gonna wish you never

00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:13.623
came to this planet!

00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:16.325
Get ready!

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.960
I draw!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.696
Haa!

00:03:20.696 --> 00:03:22.932
(panting)

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:27.937
My luck hasn't run out yet.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.440
I activate

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.609
the spell Triangle Gimmick Box!

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.945
By banishing three Xyz Monsters

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:36.946
from my graveyard,

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:38.948
I can summon a new Xyz Monster

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.717
by negating
its special abilities!

00:03:41.717 --> 00:03:42.952
So I'm saying goodbye

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.521
to Gimmick Puppet
Giant Grinder,

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.355
Giant Hunter,

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.624
and Gimmick Puppet Of Strings!

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.760
I summon...

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.663
Number 88!

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:58.567
Gimmick Puppet of Leo!

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:02.338
That monster, it almost
beat me in our last duel.

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:04.941
If it uses up
all its Overlay Units,

00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:08.311
I automatically lose the duel!

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.348
But you're so foolish
that you had to negate

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:13.950
that special ability
to summon it,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.520
so your monster's like
a lion without claws or jaws.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.524
In that case, I'm gonna
have to sharpen its fangs!

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:22.425
I activate

00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:25.795
Rank-Up-Magic
Argent Chaos Force!

00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:27.463
(tone echoes)

00:04:27.463 --> 00:04:28.431
Ehh...

00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:32.668
I overlay
Gimmick Puppet of Leo!

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:33.736
With this monster,

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:37.273
I rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:39.809
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.778
I summon Chaos Number 88,

00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:45.915
Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo!

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:48.250
(thunder booms)

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.362
Looks like this duel's
about to get chaotic,

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:01.964
and that's music to my ears!

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:04.767
(cackling)

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.503
Say hello to Chaos Number 88,

00:05:09.503 --> 00:05:11.605
Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo!

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:14.842
That monster of yours is
meaningless, Quattro.

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.543
As long as my Silent Honor Dark

00:05:16.543 --> 00:05:20.114
has Chaos Overlay Units,
I'm unbeatable!

00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:23.117
Yeah, because it can
keep getting resummoned.

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:25.853
And even worse,
you gain life points

00:05:25.853 --> 00:05:28.856
equal to its attack points.

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:29.857
But now,

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:31.158
things will be different,

00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:35.663
thanks to Disaster Leo's
special ability!

00:05:35.663 --> 00:05:37.831
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:41.835
you take
4,000 points of damage!

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:42.603
What!?

00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:46.106
Ferocious Firestorm!

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.377
Aah!

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:54.848
Not too shabby.

00:05:54.848 --> 00:05:57.651
If Nash hadn't
stocked up on life points,

00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.853
he would've been toast.

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:01.221
(grunts) I've still got

00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.723
plenty of life points left

00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:04.425
to take out a chump
like you out!

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.593
I don't care if you have
a billion life points,

00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:08.862
you're still
going down, right now!

00:06:09.063 --> 00:06:10.130
But how?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.598
Allow me to explain.

00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:14.835
Disaster Leo also has
Gimmick Puppet of Leo's

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:16.437
special abilities!

00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:19.106
(gasps) Oh, no...

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:19.840
Oh, yes!

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.209
Since Disaster Leo
doesn't have any

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:23.544
Overlay Units right now,

00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:28.215
I automatically win the duel
at the end of the turn!

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:29.516
(grunts)

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:32.853
Goodbye, Nash,
and good riddance.

00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:35.856
Final Crackdown!

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.096
(roaring)

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.835
Unreal.

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:50.304
Yuma, I did it.

00:06:50.304 --> 00:06:51.672
Nash is no more.

00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:53.841
Oh, really?
Huh?!

00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:55.843
I'm still here.

00:06:57.845 --> 00:06:59.346
How could you survive?

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:03.450
I suggest you take
a close look at your monster.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.853
What did you do?

00:07:05.853 --> 00:07:07.287
How could Disaster Leo

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:08.455
still have an Overlay Unit?

00:07:08.455 --> 00:07:11.725
Because I used
the trap Overlay Award,

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:12.593
you fool!

00:07:12.593 --> 00:07:16.363
It let Silent Honor Dark
give your feline friend

00:07:16.363 --> 00:07:18.832
an Overlay Unit.

00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:25.139
That prevented Disaster Leo's

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.840
special ability from working.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.842
(growls)
Doesn't matter
what you do,

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:31.712
you're not walking away
from this duel with a "W"!

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:35.149
Silent Honor Dark has
no more Overlay Units,

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:36.750
so the next time I destroy it,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.751
it's not coming back.

00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:41.455
I'll finish you
next turn for sure!

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:46.326
Only one thing is
sure, Quattro!

00:07:46.326 --> 00:07:48.462
Your defeat.

00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:50.164
I activate the spell

00:07:50.164 --> 00:07:54.134
Cross Draw of Destiny!

00:07:54.134 --> 00:07:56.804
We each draw one card.

00:07:56.804 --> 00:07:58.305
If the card is a monster,

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:00.841
then it's summoned
on to the opponent's field

00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:01.842
in defense mode,

00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:03.410
but the owner gains life points

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.548
equal to that monster's
attack points.

00:08:07.548 --> 00:08:10.584
(thinking)lf I don't draw
a monster here,

00:08:10.584 --> 00:08:11.418
<i>I lose.</i>

00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:15.489
(thinking)
One draw decides
everything.

00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:26.100
(both) Ready...

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.535
Draw!

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.605
I can tell from your reaction

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:33.373
you didn't draw a monster.

00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:37.244
Let's see what I drew.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:38.846
Huh?

00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:43.851
Looks like one of us
got what they needed.

00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.285
You mean...?

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:46.420
That's right!

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.856
I drew a monster card.

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.624
Silent Wobby!

00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:52.860
Because of Cross Draw
of Destiny's effect,

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.695
Silent Wobby goes to you,

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:58.832
and I get life points
equal to its attack points!

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.839
I activate Silent Honor Dark's

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.307
special ability!

00:09:07.307 --> 00:09:10.377
Silent Wobby becomes
Silent Honor Dark's

00:09:10.377 --> 00:09:14.348
Chaos Overlay Unit!

00:09:20.454 --> 00:09:24.558
Silent Honor Dark,
get ready to battle!

00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:27.728
Attack Disaster Leo!

00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.604
(enormous boom)

00:09:44.378 --> 00:09:46.813
As long as
Silent Honor Dark has

00:09:46.813 --> 00:09:48.182
a Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:09:48.182 --> 00:09:50.851
it comes back
even if it's destroyed.

00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.853
Return from Oblivion!

00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:55.856
And I just keep getting
more and more life points

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:58.859
every time it does!

00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:02.696
Ahh!

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.401
No matter what I do,
he keeps on getting stronger!

00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:09.836
And I don't plan on stopping.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.838
I activate the spell...

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:13.674
Power Stream!

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:15.842
It becomes Silent Honor Dark's

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:18.345
Overlay Unit!

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:22.583
That means, due to that
Overlay Award card of yours,

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:23.850
I can't automatically win

00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:26.653
with Disaster Leo's
special ability.

00:10:26.653 --> 00:10:27.754
But that doesn't mean I lost

00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:29.256
all my chances at victory.

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:31.525
Thanks to
Cross Draw Of Destiny,

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:32.593
I got lucky too.

00:10:32.593 --> 00:10:36.396
And I drew a card that's
gonna help me crush you!

00:10:36.396 --> 00:10:36.830
Haa!

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.499
It's the spell
Gimmick Vengeance!

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:40.500
Haa-haa!

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.302
Now you take damage equal to

00:10:42.302 --> 00:10:44.438
Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo's

00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:45.172
attack points!

00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:46.573
I'm just loving the fact that

00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:48.275
this guy doesn't know
when to quit!

00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:52.779
That's 3,500 points
of damage coming your way!

00:10:58.852 --> 00:11:01.355
Aah!

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:06.793
All I need is
one more turn to...

00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:07.694
(groans)

00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:08.729
finish him off.

00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:11.531
Well, too bad,
because you're not

00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:13.834
going to get another turn.

00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:15.769
Because Silent Honor Dark's

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:19.539
going to destroy
your Disaster Leo!

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:21.141
What are you talking about?

00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:24.411
Silent Honor Dark has
fewer attack points

00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:25.612
than Disaster Leo!

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:29.850
You're forgetting about
my Power Stream spell.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.651
Huh?

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:31.852
It gives my Silent Honor Dark

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:35.522
an additional
1,000 attack points!

00:11:35.522 --> 00:11:39.860
So now, your monster has
more attack points than mine!

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.461
It's over.

00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:43.730
I can't believe I lost.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.732
Goodbye, Quattro.

00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:50.604
Silent Honor Dark,
attack Disaster Leo!

00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:08.855
Huh?

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:11.491
Aah!

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:24.738
Ugh...

00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.844
You never should have
challenged me, Quattro.

00:12:30.844 --> 00:12:32.079
Winning was never

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.181
in the cards for you.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.120
Yuma's waking up!

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.623
(groans) Hey, Tori.

00:12:45.623 --> 00:12:46.724
How's it going?

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:47.558
Where are we?

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.694
We are traveling in
a four-wheeled vehicle

00:12:49.694 --> 00:12:51.696
that is being driven
by Quinton.

00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:52.697
What happened to me?

00:12:52.697 --> 00:12:54.098
(Astral) Extreme battle fatigue

00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:55.499
caused you to lose
consciousness

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.702
when the seven Barian
emperors appeared.

00:12:57.702 --> 00:12:59.704
Yeah, that's right.
There was a flash,

00:12:59.704 --> 00:13:01.939
and then all of a sudden
I could see Shark,

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:04.375
in, like, ancient times.

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:06.711
What about the others?

00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:07.712
Is everybody okay?

00:13:07.945 --> 00:13:11.182
What happened
to Bronk and Quattro?

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:14.986
To allow us to escape,
they... remained behind.

00:13:14.986 --> 00:13:17.188
You mean they're...
they're fighting

00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:18.155
the Barian Emperors,

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:22.426
all on their own?
(tone echoes)

00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:23.327
Stop the car!

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:25.563
We just lost Quattro's signal!

00:13:25.563 --> 00:13:27.565
(gasps)

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:34.705
Hey, Quinton.

00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:36.274
If you lost
your brother's signal,

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:40.111
does that mean he's been
sent to Barian World?

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:49.253
There are still
five foes we must deal with,

00:13:49.253 --> 00:13:51.022
Kite, Quinton, and Trey,

00:13:51.022 --> 00:13:52.323
Astral, and Yuma.

00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:55.426
(Quattro)
All right. We have
to search everywhere.

00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:57.194
Do whatever it takes
to find them

00:13:57.194 --> 00:13:57.995
and finish them.

00:13:57.995 --> 00:14:01.699
We're gonna settle this,
Yuma, right now!

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:05.169
It's obvious from
that last duel

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:07.605
I can't afford
to underestimate Nash.

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:09.674
If he reaches
his full potential,

00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:12.610
then even I couldn't beat him.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.511
Oh, well.

00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:17.615
Guess it's time to kick
nasty into overdrive.

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:21.218
No way.
It can't be true!

00:14:21.218 --> 00:14:22.720
Quattro and Bronk

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.023
and the others are gone?

00:14:26.023 --> 00:14:27.224
Why did this...

00:14:27.224 --> 00:14:29.527
why did this
have to happen to them?

00:14:29.527 --> 00:14:33.364
(sobbing) It's all my fault!

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:37.001
It's my fault that
they're all...

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.235
gone!

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:39.704
Yuma, it's not your...

00:14:39.704 --> 00:14:42.006
(voice)
Fault?
(gasps)

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.474
Huh?

00:14:43.474 --> 00:14:46.010
We're all to blame for this.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.477
Kite!

00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:49.647
There's no point in
sugarcoating the truth, Yuma.

00:14:49.647 --> 00:14:52.616
We don't have time
for self-pity.

00:14:52.616 --> 00:14:54.485
Quinton...

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:55.152
Trey...

00:14:55.152 --> 00:14:56.587
Kite is right, Yuma.

00:14:56.587 --> 00:14:59.724
Unless we finish
the Barians once and for all,

00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:04.295
Quattro and the others
fought for nothing.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.129
You're right.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:07.365
But I don't get
why Shark turned on us

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.466
all of a sudden.

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:09.500
It doesn't matter.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.001
Shark is a Barian now,

00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:13.371
and we've got to
stop him no matter what.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.107
I don't care if he is a Barian!

00:15:16.107 --> 00:15:17.708
Shark's still our friend!

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.711
Quattro was his friend,
and Shark took him down.

00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:23.614
Face it, Yuma.
He's no friend.

00:15:23.614 --> 00:15:24.715
He's our enemy now.

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:28.652
I'm not giving up on Shark
or any other Barians!

00:15:28.652 --> 00:15:29.720
I know we can convince them

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.389
to stop all this fighting!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.957
Maybe it doesn't make sense,

00:15:32.957 --> 00:15:34.725
but we've got to keep trying

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.694
to understand each other.

00:15:36.694 --> 00:15:38.396
As long as we do that,

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.531
I know we can find
a way out of this.

00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:43.667
(thinking) A path that
avoids battle!

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:45.202
All right.

00:15:45.202 --> 00:15:46.570
Show us the way.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.072
I don't have one.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:50.207
(Astral) Perhaps I do.

00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:54.445
Instead of fighting
the seven Barian Emperors,

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:55.679
let us eliminate the source

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:58.716
and defeat
Don Thousand instead.

00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.217
Don Thousand?

00:16:00.217 --> 00:16:01.719
Who's that?

00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:05.389
Don Thousand is
the great Barian deity.

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:08.025
<i>I defeated him long ago,</i>

00:16:08.025 --> 00:16:10.361
<i>but he must have resurrected,</i>

00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:12.696
<i>for only his great power</i>
could cause

00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:14.565
<i>this much destruction.</i>

00:16:14.565 --> 00:16:17.701
<i>Perhaps Don Thousand</i>
used the emperors

00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:20.704
<i>to revive his own power.</i>

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.007
Yeah!

00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:25.709
Then let's go
to Barian World
and beat him!

00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:27.178
That guy doesn't
stand a chance!

00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:29.680
I won't be going with you.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.383
Kite, what do you mean
you're not going?

00:16:32.383 --> 00:16:33.417
Come on, Orbital.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:34.652
Aye-aye, C-C-Captain!

00:16:34.652 --> 00:16:36.520
I've got more
important things to do

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.721
than run around with you.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.425
But, Kite, what could be
more important than this?

00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:43.561
Well?

00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:45.362
Kite, wait!

00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:47.264
(tone echoes)

00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:51.702
(Yuma) Kite!

00:16:54.405 --> 00:16:56.106
(Yuma) Kite!

00:16:56.106 --> 00:16:57.408
(growling)

00:16:57.408 --> 00:16:58.576
Yuma...

00:16:58.576 --> 00:17:01.111
Trey and I are not
going with you.

00:17:01.111 --> 00:17:03.214
For what the seven emperors
have done,

00:17:03.214 --> 00:17:05.716
we're going to get
our revenge for Quattro!

00:17:05.716 --> 00:17:07.451
Quattro wouldn't want that!

00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:08.319
We gotta stick together!

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.255
He'd be the first in line
to go to Barian World!

00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:12.723
We'll never know
if that's true,

00:17:12.723 --> 00:17:13.724
'cause he's gone!

00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:14.725
But Trey...

00:17:14.725 --> 00:17:17.328
You go and run away
from the Emperors

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.529
like a coward.

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:21.699
You have to be strong
in order to take revenge.

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.701
I'm sick of
hearing you talk about

00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:27.304
how dueling is
all about friendship.

00:17:27.304 --> 00:17:30.641
If you want to know what
dueling's really about,

00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:33.477
go and ask Quattro.

00:17:35.946 --> 00:17:38.716
(tires screech)

00:17:40.384 --> 00:17:42.720
Our allies have deserted us.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.723
We'll be fine.
Let 'em go.

00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:48.292
But Trey's wrong
about dueling...

00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:49.693
and I'll prove it!

00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:53.364
Yuma, this mission is
too dangerous

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.000
for Tori and our friends.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.601
(whimpers)

00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:58.369
Ha!

00:17:58.369 --> 00:17:59.670
Tori, you and the guys go

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.372
and give my Grandma a message.

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:03.107
Tell her I won't be
back for dinner,

00:18:03.107 --> 00:18:04.708
but have my breakfast ready!

00:18:04.942 --> 00:18:08.445
Yuma, what if you don't...

00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:09.713
I'll be fine, Tori.

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:12.449
Really.
Trust me.

00:18:12.449 --> 00:18:14.385
Don't you believe him, Tori!

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.020
You're going with him!

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.055
(both grunt)

00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:20.724
(both) Hey, what the...

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.061
Now, Tori,
Yuma's your responsibility.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.430
Make sure he stays
safe and sound,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.032
or you'll have to deal with me,

00:18:28.032 --> 00:18:30.601
which would be a catastrophe!

00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:32.703
(sighing)

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.208
Hey, Cathy,

00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:40.544
why'd you make Tori
go with Yuma?

00:18:40.544 --> 00:18:41.345
I want to go,

00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:42.713
but Tori's perfect
for this mission.

00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:45.716
If I went, Yuma wouldn't
be able to focus.

00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:47.718
He'd just want
to spend time with me.

00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:52.723
I must say Trey,
this is delectable.

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:57.328
What is it called again?

00:18:57.328 --> 00:18:58.696
It's duel fuel.

00:18:58.696 --> 00:18:59.697
A Tsukumo specialty.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.567
Imagine if Yuma could duel
as good as this tastes.

00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:06.070
Trey, I'm sorry

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.106
we had to leave Yuma
the way we did.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.941
There was
no other way, Quinton.

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:15.446
<i>We knew the Barians</i>
were minutes away.

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.214
And if Yuma knew about that,

00:19:17.214 --> 00:19:19.416
he would have insisted
on battling them,

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:20.985
but this way, he'll carry out

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:23.954
his mission to take on
Don Thousand instead.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.123
He and Astral are the only ones

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.291
who can end this battle.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.492
We'll be the decoys

00:19:28.492 --> 00:19:30.694
and draw the Barians
to us instead,

00:19:30.928 --> 00:19:33.697
till they're
safely on their way.

00:19:34.698 --> 00:19:38.702
Quinton, you really believe
Yuma can do this, don't you?

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:40.704
Yuma's our last chance, Trey.

00:19:40.704 --> 00:19:43.207
I believe in him,
because he's always

00:19:43.207 --> 00:19:44.541
feeling the flow.

00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:47.645
You two pests know
where Yuma and Kite are,

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.713
and I want to know right now.

00:19:49.713 --> 00:19:50.714
Not a chance, Mizar.

00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:52.716
We'll never tell you anything!

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.519
I believe the power
of my Galaxy-Eyes

00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:56.220
will sway you.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.422
There's only one way
to find out.

00:19:58.422 --> 00:20:00.357
Besides, if we chickened out,

00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:02.726
Quattro would never
let us live it down.

00:20:02.726 --> 00:20:05.029
(chuckling)
You can ask him yourself.

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:08.465
You'll be with him very soon.

00:23:07.044 --> 00:23:10.380
