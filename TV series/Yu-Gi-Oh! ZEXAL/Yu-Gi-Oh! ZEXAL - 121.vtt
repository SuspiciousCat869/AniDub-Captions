WEBVTT

00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:03.754
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal"...

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:05.620
Barian World?
Yes.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.719
What is important is for
you to fully realize

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.723
everything
about your true self.

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:17.394
Huh?

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:18.262
(crowd clamoring)

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.930
We must save the emperor.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.498
Attack the enemy!

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:23.934
(crowd clamoring)

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:26.003
Hold on.
Who gave the orders to attack?

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:27.237
They shouldn't be fighting!

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:28.005
(Vector) Well, they are,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:29.506
and their destiny
rests in your hands.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.508
This is a Shadow Duel, Nash.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:34.511
Our duel determines
the fate of our armies.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.148
And you're the one
who made it happen!

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:42.853
(Shark)
Abyss Splash,
attack Gorgonic Guardian!

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:45.489
(explosion)

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.058
Aah!

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:51.762
My men...

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.497
I brought this on.

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:58.502
I"m the one to blame for all
this destruction.

00:00:58.502 --> 00:00:59.836
Now do you see?

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.972
Do you understand
why you became

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:03.373
the leader of the Barians?

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:07.044
All their souls
went to Barian World.

00:01:07.044 --> 00:01:09.446
And you, as a true leader,

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:12.115
will not abandon your people.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.318
I'm a... Barian.

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:17.054
(Yuma)
There's no way
I can lose this duel!

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:19.356
I'm gonna get you
out of there, Astral.

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:20.791
I promise.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.026
(Eliphas) Your end is at hand!

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.996
Witness the ultimate power
that I possess.

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:30.033
Cower at my
Rank 13 Xyz Monster!

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.504
How can I beat something
I never even knew existed?

No way! I never knew that kind

00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:42.506
It is my turn!

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.943
I activate Astral Force's
effect from my graveyard!

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:50.847
That lets me return
this card to my hand

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:52.249
instead of drawing one!

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.884
Oh, no, here he goes again!

00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:58.488
I activate the spell card
Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force!

00:02:58.488 --> 00:03:02.292
Watch in awe as I summon
the most powerful monster

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:04.494
you have ever laid eyes upon!

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.930
(groaning)

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.765
I rebuild the Overlay Network

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:12.502
with New Order 12:
Etheric Maahes!

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:15.939
Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.975
(dramatic music)

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:19.376
♪♪

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:34.491
I summon the all-powerful
New Order 13: Etheric Amon!

00:03:50.807 --> 00:03:51.308
He did it.

00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:56.346
He summoned the most
powerful monster ever!

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.352
Is Yuma going to make it back?

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:03.286
(Quinton) I don't see how.

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.789
The energy's gone beyond
the teleporter's limits.

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.391
It's completely unstable.

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:11.428
(booming)

00:04:11.428 --> 00:04:13.129
Oh!
Oh!

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.798
Master Kite, if we
don't leave now,

00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:17.501
we'll be destroyed along
with the teleporter!

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.302
Yuma...

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:19.769
(groaning)

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.873
Orbital 7's right...
we have to go.

00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:23.773
(whining)

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:25.375
No!
We can't go!

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:26.276
Yuma isn't back yet!

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:29.479
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do for him now.

00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:32.315
(sighing) Yuma...

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.184
Prepare to feel the wrath

00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:39.489
of my Rank 13 Xyz Monster
Etheric Amon!

00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:40.857
♪♪

00:04:40.857 --> 00:04:43.493
I activate Etheric Amon's
special ability.

00:04:43.493 --> 00:04:49.399
The cards in your deck become
Etheric Amon's Overlay Units!

00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:57.507
(gasping)

00:04:57.507 --> 00:05:00.911
The Rank difference between
Utopia Ray Victory

00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:03.947
and Etheric Amon's is 8!

00:05:03.947 --> 00:05:08.485
So Etheric Amon
gains 8 Overlay Units.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.455
No! Now it's even
more powerful!

00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:20.230
And now, I activate Amon's
other special ability.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.501
It gains 100 attack points
for every Overlay Unit!

00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:25.502
(groaning)

00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:30.507
It has 11 Overlay Units, so
it gains 1,100 attack points.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:34.411
But there is more, Rank Up
Advantage lets me draw a card.

00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.279
And with the power
of Shining Draw,

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.249
I get to draw
any card I desire!

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.818
Yaah!

00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:43.353
But I will not even
need this card,

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:47.357
because this next attack
will be your end!

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.855
Etheric Amon,
attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.191
But first, Rank Domination

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.629
lowers Utopia Ray Victory's
attack points to zero!

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.863
You battled valiantly,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:07.200
even though winning
was never attainable.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.836
Its attack points
are totally gone!

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:13.840
As are any chances you had
of winning this duel.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.743
Good-bye, Yuma.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:20.847
Etheric Amon, finish him!

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.851
I don't have
any cards in my hand

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.154
and Utopia Ray Victory's
powerless.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.856
(groaning)

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.759
Ah! Hold up!

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.494
I activate...

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.862
Purge Ray!

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:38.098
By tributing
Utopia Ray Victory,

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:41.534
I can summon an Xyz
Monster from my graveyard

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.170
at the end of my turn!

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:47.240
This does not change anything!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.779
Etheric Amon, attack Yuma
directly instead!

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:58.118
I summon Rainbow Kuriboh
from my graveyard!

00:06:58.118 --> 00:06:59.452
What!

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.856
When you attacked me directly,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.426
Rainbow Kuriboh
can come to my aid!

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.631
(groaning)

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.665
Fine, then.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.835
I will just
destroy your monster.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.841
I'm sorry, Rainbow Kuriboh.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:27.280
(groaning)

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:30.417
I end my turn.

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.851
Now that your turn's done,

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.854
Purge Ray lets me
summon an Xyz Monster!

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:38.792
So welcome back Utopia!

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.627
Why would you summon a monster

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.663
that is not as strong
as Utopia Ray Victory?

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.533
When you find out, it'll
be too late, Eliphas!

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.134
You are wrong, Yuma.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.804
Etheric Amon
special ability activates!

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:54.374
So not only does Etheric Amon
gain Overlay Units,

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:57.110
but you lose cards
from your deck.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.412
Again?

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:07.387
Since Etheric Amon
gained 9 Overlay Units,

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:11.224
it also gains
900 attack points.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.860
That thing is
all kinds of powerful.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.363
It is impossible
for you to beat me.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.599
We'll see.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:26.072
(thunderous crashing)

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.843
Yuma!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.712
Yuma!

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.849
Astral...

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:36.850
You gotta help me!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.220
I know in the past I didn't
always want your help.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.489
I know I gave you a hard time
for being conceited,

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:45.425
for telling me what
to do and how to do it

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:46.860
and for putting me down
sometimes.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:50.497
But you changed more
than just how I duel...

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.132
you changed my life.

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:56.302
Astral... you mean
everything to me.

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.470
Everything!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.807
That's why I...

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:03.776
I can't take losing you again.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:07.614
I can't afford to lose!

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.850
What's this?

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:11.651
Yeah, Astral!

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.554
I knew you'd have
my back no matter what!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.855
So...

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:19.826
Let's do this!

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:20.693
(grunting)

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:25.865
Go, Shining Draw!

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:27.767
(gasping)

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.469
The last time a light
such as this appeared

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:34.841
was when Astral battled the
Barian diety, Don Thousand.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.847
(explosion)

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:46.186
(roaring)

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.856
Aah!

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:59.432
Could I have been
wrong about this boy?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.801
(groaning)

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.838
It's here, Eliphas.

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:09.175
Time to show you what my bond
with Astral's made of!

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:12.712
I activate Rank-Down-Magic
Numeron Fall!

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:18.284
Instead of ranking up Utopia,
this card ranks it down!

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.355
Why would you ever
rank it down?

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:26.593
I rebuild the Overlay Network
with Utopia!

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:30.863
Go, Xyz De-evolution!

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:40.306
Come on out Number 39,
Utopia Roots!

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:02.328
Your Number will not
be around for long.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.263
This I promise!

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.866
I activate Etheric Amon's
special ability!

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.868
So once again,
the cards in your deck

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.839
become Etheric Amon's
Overlay Units.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.675
Aah!

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:16.843
Due to the fact

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.646
that you foolishly
ranked down your monster,

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:23.616
my Etheric Amon
gains 12 Overlay Units.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.852
And remember, Etheric Amon

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.555
gains 100 attack points
for every Overlay Unit.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:32.859
Now you do not have any cards
left in your deck

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.427
or any left in your hand.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.496
Your strategy was a flawed one.

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:39.232
Wrong, it's 100% foolproof!

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:40.166
How can that be?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:45.305
Actions speak louder than words
so how 'bout I show you?

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:45.772
(grunting)

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:49.709
Utopia Roots,
attack Etheric Amon!
You fool!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.579
You cannot destroy Amon with
only 500 attack points!

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:54.213
You sure?

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.550
I activate Utopia Roots'
special ability!

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.585
Utopia Roots gives Etheric Amon

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:02.555
an Overlay Unit
to stop its attack.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.556
That may seem bad for me

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.858
'cause you can add another
one to your collection.

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:06.659
But since the difference

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.795
between our monsters'
Ranks is 12,

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:15.868
Utopia Root's attack
points become 1,200!

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:16.836
That insignificant power up

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.304
will not make
a difference in this battle!

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:22.275
You would be right, except
Utopia Root's attack points

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:22.842
also get multiplied

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.845
by the number of Overlay
Units on your monster!

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.514
Etheric Amon has
33 Overlay Units,

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:33.686
and that's 33 reasons why
I'm gonna win this duel!

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:39.859
Too little, too late.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.862
You stopped Utopia Roots'
attack already,

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:46.199
and it can't attack again!

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.633
Don't be so sure.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.836
I activate the spell
Double Or Nothing!

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.573
Not only does it double Utopia
Root's attack points,

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:56.709
but it lets it attack again!

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.483
A monster as powerful
as that cannot be stopped.

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:05.852
That's what I was thinking!

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:06.853
Utopia Roots!

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:11.858
Finish this with
Rising Sun Roots Slash!

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:18.264
This is the new light that
will protect this world!

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.432

All right.
Time to free my pal.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:46.859
You defeated me, Yuma.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:49.762
And as we agreed, Astral
shall now be set free.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.732
Thank you, Eliphas.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.836
Just as Yuma
shared with us his power,

The light you shared
