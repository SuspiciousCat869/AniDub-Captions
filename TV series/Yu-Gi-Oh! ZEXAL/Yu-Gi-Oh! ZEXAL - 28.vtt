WEBVTT

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.560
Tori: This is
a dangerous shortcut!

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.890
YUMA: If we go around, we'll
miss the previews, Tori!

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.560
You're dragging me through a
construction site for previews?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.060
Unnnh!

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.460
I don't even care
about the movie.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.190
But they're gonna have the
trailer for the next "Lunar

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.830
battalion" sequel,
I've gotta see it!

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.390
Astral: Why is she nervous?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.360
What exactly happens at this
place known as a construction

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.990
site?

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.160
Construction happens, what else.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.260
They're building some
Kinda giant new mall.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.390
It's gonna be the biggest
in the world, I heard.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.230
C'mon yuma, I don't like this.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.360
It's totally safe.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190

Tori!

[screaming]

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
is this your idea
of totally safe?

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.830
Jump!

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.030
You okay, Tori?

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.330
I'm good.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.590
What was that all about?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.760
Wha...

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.060
no one's driving.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.090
Cody: You numbskulls
aren't wearing helmets!

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.760
Don't you guys know that
construction sites are dangerous

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.560
places?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.860
Sorry for almost
turning you into pancakes.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.160
I saw the beams falling and went
to hit them out of the way and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.390
then accidentally put the
excavator into gear and then I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.690
couldn't reach the
dumb brakes to stop it.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.730
How does a kindergartener even
get onto a construction site and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.890
accidentally do anything?

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.060
A what?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.560
A kindergartner?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.530
I'll have you know that Cody
callus is in middle school.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.260
I'm just vertically challenged.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.560
Oh!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.960
We're in middle
school too, Cody!

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.130
I'm Tori,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.830
and this is yuma.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.430
Thank you for trying to save us.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.590
That was so brave!

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.390
You okay, pal?

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.890
Uh, what's everyone lookin' at?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.330
What a huge truck!

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.390
Oh that's Gracie, she can haul
like three-Hundred hogs!

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.130
That's maybe the most
amazing thing I've ever heard.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.790
All those pigs.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.290
Not real hogs.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.790
My old man and his
crew refer to tons as "Hogs."

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.560
Your dad works construction?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.830
Yeah,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.290
he's the Foreman on this site.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.730
No wonder you know so
much about this stuff.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.460
This concerns me.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.460
Those enormous beams over there
appear to be held together by

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.730
nothing more than a few metallic
pieces. That strikes me as a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.690
precarious arrangement.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.860
What's that big
machine up there?

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.760
That is barnabe.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.590
That thing could
lift a mountain.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.990
Something tells me we're not
going to catch that movie or

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.330
preview.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.160
It'd be so cool to
drive that thing.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.690
Cause it'd make you feel
all super strong right?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.730
Yeah, that's pretty much why I
decided to step up and compete

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.630
in the world duel carnival.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.490
I may be a little guy, but when
I'm dueling and I'm controlling

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.930
these powerful monsters,
I feel bigger than I am.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.160
It makes me feel like
there's nothing I can't do.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.430
I know exactly what you mean.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.390
So uh, does that mean you're
in the duel carnival?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.930
Yup.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.890
Really? Well, I hate to break
it to ya', But no one stands a

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.360
chance against my
heavy machinery deck.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.330
You only say that because
you haven't seen my deck.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.830
Oh...

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.230
sounds like a challenge.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.330
It is.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.590
Let's do this!

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.130
Hope you're ready!

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.890
Duel Disk, go!

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.360
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.160
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.530
Get set to get decked!

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.130
TOGETHER: Now let's duel!

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.490
You ready to rumble?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.890
I'm going first!

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.490
I draw!

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.730
And I'm kickin' things off
by summoning a monster.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.260
Here comes jumbo drill!

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.090
Next I activate the charging
construction spell card!

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.190
Since I summoned jumbo drill,
charging construction lets me

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.830
bust out another heavy
hitter in defense mode.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.190
Get ready to tremble before the
sheer awesomeness of my mighty

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.860
Road Roller!

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.690
And now I activate jumbo
drill's special ability.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.760
Since road Roller is on site,
jumbo drill gains three-Hundred

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.230
attack points.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.630
Aaah, man!

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.030
Those machines of
yours are pretty sweet.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.430
Not the response
I was expecting.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.660
Your opponent just
summoned two monsters.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.560
I end my turn by throwin'
one card facedown.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.190
Bam!

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.930
Now you're getting to see what
my mighty machines are all

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.890
about.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.990
And now you get to see
what I'm all about.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.360
First up,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.260
I'm summoning
gagaga magician!

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.290
Yuma, look at the attack
and defense points of your

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.960
opponent's monsters. I am sorry
to say, but gagaga magician

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.390
cannot put a Dent
into either one of them.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.630
Oh man, what was I thinking?

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.190
This isn't good.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.090
Perhaps an equip
spell would help.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.030
I was just about
to say that.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.360
From my hand, I activate
the bound wand equip spell.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.130
When a monster is equipped with
bound wand, it gains one hundred

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.560
attack points for
each of it's levels.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.660
That's a pretty
neat stick n' all,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.360
but even with that power up,
your magician isn't strong

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.490
enough to put a Dent
into my mighty machines.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.760
Yuma,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.760
need I gently remind you
that gagaga magician's special

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.730
ability allows him to
change levels once per turn?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.360
Oh Yeah, that's right.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.430
By activating gagaga magician's
special ability, I can change

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.490
him from a level 4 to a level 8!

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.760
Which means bound wand can grant
him another four Hundred attack

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.230
points.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.590
And now gagaga magician,
attack jumbo drill!

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.230
Bring it on,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.530
cause I'm playing the
trap card - Foreman's fury!

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.860
So now, a thousand of your
magician's attack points are

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.390
about to disappear
into Thin air!

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.630
No way!

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.160
Oh Yes way!

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.960
Yuma!

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.360
Use bound wand's
effect now, yuma!

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.430
Yeah,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.930
I was gonna!

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.890
When the monster equipped
with bound Wand is destroyed in

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.360
battle, that monster can return
to the field when the battle

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.160
ends.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.560
That will help, But the
situation is still dire.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.490
You should focus
on defending.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.890
That way you will not take
battle Damage if your magician

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.660
is destroyed again.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.330
Good call, astral.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:03.530
I return gagaga magician
in defense mode.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.130
Then I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.490
Do you seriously think you can
defend against the power of my

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.360
heavy hitters?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.730
Let's find out!

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.190
I draw!

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.290
I'm summoning strong shovel
excavator to join me on the job

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.760
site!

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.490
Now that strong shovel has dug
in, jumbo drill gains another

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.790
300 attack points.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.360
And now strong shovel's gonna
dig into your gagaga magician.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.860
Yuma!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.830
I'm activating the half
unbreak trap card!

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.160
With This trap card in play, my
monster isn't destroyed, and the

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.260
damage I would have
taken is cut in half.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.590
Not too bad there. You and your
monster got through that without

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.030
so much as a scratch.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.790
Well then, I guess I'm gonna
have to find some other way to

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.590
hammer you into the ground.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.030
You can try, But half unbreak's
effect remains in play.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:16.660
Too bad that's not gonna stop
Jumbo drill from attacking.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.990
And jumbo drill's
got a special ability.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.360
When your magician's in defense
mode, and jumbo's attack points

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.660
are greater than your magician's
defense points, the difference

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.790
is dealt to you as damage.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.590
You see that?

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.130
That's what my machines
are all about, just

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.430
tearin' down absolutely anything
that's dense enough to stand in

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.790
their way!

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.090
Hey, how come it's
in defense mode now?

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.230
Oh yeah Well, uh... thing about
jumbo drill is after it attacks,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.490
it's gotta go on defense
until the end of my next turn.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.690
Mandated union break, I guess.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.560
That's construction humor.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.190
That sounds like it'd be kind
of a pain to have to deal with.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.430
Hey, if you want heavy
machinery to do what heavy

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.160
machinery does best,
maintenance is a must.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.290
It's like my dad always says,
"heartland city wasn't built it

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.760
in a day"...

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.930
This is your chance.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.130
Do not waste it.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.260
I'm on it!

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.430
It's my turn now!

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.560
I draw!

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.960
Let's make this happen!

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.360
First, I'm switching gagaga
magician to attack mode.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.130
Next, I'm summoning
mystical donator!

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.390
Mystical donator is
all about giving.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.890
Once a turn, he's willing to
give up his attack points and

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.930
either give 'em to another
monster on my field, or give 'em

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.930
to me so I can
increase my life points.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.930
This time, mystical donator is
gonna give his attack points to

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.490
gagaga magician!

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.330
Aw, nuts and bolts!

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:56.160
And with that, gagaga magician
ATTACKS STRONG shovel excavator!

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.360
Dig that!

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.390
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.090
And now gagaga magician and
mystical donator return back to

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.590
normal.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.690
Those super big machines of
yours pack a lot of power,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.930
but dueling isn't just
about power, Cody!

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.490
Interesting.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.460
What else is there
other than power?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.130
You know there's
like, uh... tactiles...

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.490
You mean tactics.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.090
I'm just sayin' it's not
about being big and powerful!

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.560
Of course it is!

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.130
Two guys suddenly
get into a fight.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.130
Then the bigger one wins,
the bigger one always wins!

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.090
What're you talkin' about?

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.230
"half pint, "short Stack",
"small fry." Oh, I've been

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.560
called all sorts of names.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.360
Back in elementary school, the
big kids made fun of me, pushed

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.960
me around, took my lunch money.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.590
One day, I was working at a
job site my dad was working at,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.030
watchin' the machines do their
thing. And that's when it hit

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.490
me. You know who stands
up to a bulldozer?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.190
No one, that's who.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.230
Cause you don't mess with power.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.390
People respect power
When they see it.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.160
They get scared by it.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.630
Me and my machines?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.160
We're gonna show the duel
carnival what power's all about.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.490
Then we'll see how many people
are calling me "Little stuff" Or

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.090
"Bite Size" Or whatever!

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.960
But Cody...

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.930
I'll show ya' what I mean!

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.660
To kick things off, I'm
activating the scrap and build

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.960
spell card!

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.630
Scrap and build gives me the
go-ahead to summon a low-Level

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.460
machine-Type monster
straight from my graveyard!

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.160
Strong Shovel's gonna
pull a double shift.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.290
Oh and uh... when this card is
summoned from the graveyard, it

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.090
gains a level.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:42.060
Next up, I'm activating another
spell card - Overhaul!

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.730
This doozy improves work
efficiency across the board by

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.160
Granting every machine-Type
monster on my field an

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.790
additional level!

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.360
I hope you're ready, 'cause
you're about to see real power.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.590
Yuma, this is bad!

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.360
I overlay jumbo drill, road
Roller and strong shovel

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.890
excavator!

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.930
With these three monsters,
I build the overlay network!

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.260
Here comes the awe-Inspiring,
pulverizing, the ultimate

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.760
machine in my crew...

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.960
I xyz summon digvorzhak,
king of heavy industry!

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.590
Thirty-Two hundred
attack points?

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.690
Yep, and digvorzhak is
gonna use them to finish you!

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:44.230
I xyz summon digvorzhak,
king of heavy industry!

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.060
Thirty-Two hundred
attack points?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.130
Yep, and digvorzhak is
gonna use them to finish you!

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.730
When you absolutely have to
demolish something, accept no

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.290
substitutes.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.060
Yuma, that monster is strong.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.360
Yeah...

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.560
first I activate
digvorzhak's special ability!

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.730
By Using one overlay unit,
digvorzhak can knock three Cards

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.060
outta your deck, and haul 'em
off to the graveyard.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.190
You gotta be kidding me.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.160
Now for every monster that was
tossed into the graveyard, a

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.260
monster on your
field is destroyed.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.560
For real?

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.890
You managed to yank two
monsters, so that means...

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.730
your field is about to
become a demolition site.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.860
Go mountain mover!

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.330
Yuma's totally vulnerable now...

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.460
if he comes at me with a
direct attack, I am done for.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.530
Try to stay focused, yuma.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.030
All right, digvorzhak!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.560
It's full throttle time!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.590
Gah!

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.690
So loud!

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.790
It's like an earthquake!

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.230
Yuma, play your trap card!

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.690
Hey, what did you say?

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.190
"try to clap hard?"

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.590
more power!

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.060
Rev that engine and give it
everything you got, digvorzhak!

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.460
I'm talkin' maximum
overdrive, baby!

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.960
Yuma, listen!

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.690
You need to activate your trap!

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.030
I can't hear you!

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.730
Captivating a crab?

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.390
Let's end this!

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.090
Go wheel of wrath!

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.560
Use your trap!

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.560
Activate it!

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.230
Oh! Activate the trap!

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.430
I'm activating a trap!

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.830
Small resistance!

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.590
When one of your monsters is
attacking, I can choose a level

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.130
4-Or-Below monster with
1000-Or-Fewer attack points and

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.360
your attacking monster loses the
same amount of attack points as

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.830
the monster I chose.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.190
I'm going with mystical donator!

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.360
Yuma!

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.290
You keep somehow managing to
survive my attacks. You won't

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.360
be so lucky next turn.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.730
my field is empty and I'm

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.590
hanging on by a lousy one
hundred life points.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.360
how am I supposed to take
down a monster that huge?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.960
What is that monster made of?

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.330
Think about what is holding
it together, yuma. After all...

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
speak up, astral!

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.230
sometimes he can
be so frustrating.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.630
And sometimes
you can be stubborn.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.160
Oh yeah? Well...

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.960
Hey, how come I could
hear you that time?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.830
because I went with telepathy.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.130
we can communicate
that way, remember?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.890
oooh, yeeeah.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.990
and now that I have got you,
I have made the following

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.990
observation about this place
known as a construction site.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.760
these gigantic structures that
you humans create are comprised

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.330
of many individual parts.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.390
okay, and?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.360
take for instance, that
hexagonal piece by your foot.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.590
this thing?

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.130
It's just a nut.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.230
consider how tiny
that piece is.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.230
and yet, it will contribute to
the support of this colossal

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.490
structure.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.790
every piece plays
an important role.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.960
without even the smallest of
components in the right places,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.030
the entire FOUNDATION
could collapse.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.930
I think you're talking
about dueling now.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.260
What's a matter, yuma?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.360
Have you been frozen
in place by awesomeness?

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.330
Don't be hard on yourself, it
happens to lots of people!

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.030
I draw!

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.530
All right, kurivolt!

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.890
Look at that dinky
little pipsqueak.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.630
What could that runt
do to my machine?

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.590
Its just gonna
scratch it's paint job.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.430
It's gonna do a lot more than
that once I activate its special

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.030
ability!

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.890
What's happening to
digvorzhak overlay units?

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.930
Kurivolt can seize overlay units
and change 'em into kurivolt

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.130
tokens.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.590
Are you serious?

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.360
It can turn overlay
units into monsters?

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.860
Well ain't that sumthin'!

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.560
still, how are those three
little monsters supposed to take

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.990
down a machine like digvorzhak?

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.230
With the help of a spell
card called mini-Guts.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.790
Go kurivolt tokens,
do your thing!

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.930
Nice try, pal!

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.030
But nobody can stop
my ultimate machine,

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.190
not even you.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.660
Go kurivolt tokens,
take out digvorzhak!

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.830
Don't you see?

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.290
Nothing can stop
my ultimate machine!

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.230
Especially not...

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.290
why?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.160
What's happening to digvorzhak?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.290
Excellent work, yuma.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.660
Using the mini-Guts spell, you
were able to tribute two level 1

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.830
monsters to strip his
machine of attack points.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.490
This seems promising.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:37.660
But...

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.730
this ain't right.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.260
Those little monsters
are so pathetic.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.960
You can finish this right now.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.190
Heh!

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.360
Digvorzhak's outta gas,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.960
and now,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.930
kurivolt's gonna race in and
shut that machine down for good!

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.160
Aaaagh!

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.590
Then due to mini-Guts' effect,
you take damage equal to

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.590
digvorzhak's original
attack points!

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.160
I am shutting your
machines down.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.690
Aaw yeah!

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.090
Aw, nuts 'n bolts.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.530
Something that small isn't
supposed to be able to take down

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.690
something that big!

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.390
You shouldn't sell little
guys so short, Cody.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.960
What do you mean?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.030
Look at this
humongous building!

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.130
Think about how many tiny pieces
are combining to hold it all

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:05.060
together. I'm just sayin' little
guys are capable of big things.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.630
Here you go yuma.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.190
You beat me.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.290
So my heart Piece is yours now.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.190
Don't waste it.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.560
Don't worry, I'll
take it all the way.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.230
You've got three now, yuma!

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.390
Ya know, I think I lost because
I underestimated what little

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.230
monsters are capable of,

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.990
which really means, I
underestimated what I'm capable

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.730
of...

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:33.930
hey Cody, we were on our way to
a movie. You wanna come with us?

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.260
Well, you see...

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.690
"Little guys are
capable of big things."

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.460
WORKER: Hey!

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.430
You know that you're not
supposed to be here, Cody!

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.590
Together: Uh-oh!

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.930
You could get hurt.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.000
Get outta here before
your dad sees you!
