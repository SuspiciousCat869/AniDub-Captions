00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.577
(Yuma)
Last time on "Yu-Gi-Oh!
Zexal"...

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:06.944
Hello, dueling fans!

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:10.411
Welcome to the World Duel
Carnival finals!

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:13.444
The duels will be held
all across the city...

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:15.477
with the aid of the Duel
Coaster!

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.144
It's so cool!

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:23.711
These really are the greatest
duelists in the world!

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:25.877
I can't wait
to defeat 'em all!

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.644
There's our
unsuspecting prey.

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:32.277
And now, it's time to put all
the Duel Coaster cars

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:33.577
into gear!

00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:36.011
The Heart Piece you collected
from your previous duels

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:39.177
will act as the ignition key for
your individual coaster car.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.777
No! It's gone!

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:47.277
I lost my Heart Piece!
It's all over!

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.011
No, it's not!

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.411
Kari came through!

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.711
You're good to go!

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:59.177
We gotta get in on
the action, Tori!

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:02.244
I predict you will soon see
plenty of action.

00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:04.344
Okay, it's time
to make our move.

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:05.877
Fang Formation!

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.811
(both)
Let's go!

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:10.611
They are staging
a joint attack.

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:13.377
It appears you
have been ambushed!

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:14.677
<i>You can't run, kid.</i>

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.277
<i>We're all going
to duel you!</i>

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.211
Three on one!

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:21.577
You are badly
outnumbered, Yuma.

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.577
You must fight wisely...

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.144
or else your first battle in the
World Duel Carnival finals

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:28.677
will be your last.

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.611
This should be
entertaining.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:33.577
Now we'll see if Yuma
has what it takes

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.111
to beat a triple threat!

(Mr. Heartland)
Oh my, things are not looking
good for young Yuma Tsukumo.

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:44.744
He's become the target of those
Duel Desperados,

00:02:44.777 --> 00:02:47.811
those Cunning Card Sharks,
those Masters of Malice!

00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:50.011
The triad of terror!

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:52.811
And their terrible triple threat
offensive!

00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:56.344
This is shaping up to
be the must-see...

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:59.311
duel of the year!

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.244
You got that right,
Heartland!

00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:02.777
Just feel the flow!

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.411
I can hardly wait for the
Triad of Terror to meet Yuma

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:09.744
and show me what this
kid can do...

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.911
So you want us to take on
this "Yuma Tsukumo" kid?

00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:17.944
Correct.

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.511
Just name your price,
gentlemen.

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:22.644
I like the sound of that.

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:24.344
Oh yeah, works for me.

00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:26.077
Then we're all
in agreement.

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.977
We'll crush this Yuma
in the blink of an eye.

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.944
(Vetrix)
Oh no, simply toy with him,
Wolfsbane.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.677
I need to see what
this boy can do with a deck!

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.844
And then I will learn what I
need to know...

00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:39.677
I will at long last, fully
witness the true nature

00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:41.211
of Yuma's powers.

00:03:58.011 --> 00:03:59.111
Watch it, you!

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:00.744
We're not playing
bumper cars!

00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:03.077
But since you wanted
my attention so bad,

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:05.777
I'd be more than
happy to give it to ya...

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.311
I summon Gagaga Caesar!

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.777
Gagaga Caesar,
attack Magnet Saucer!

00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:26.777
I'm in the driver's
seat now!

00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:29.911
Yuma, your confidence
may be premature.

00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:32.077
Look at the remaining
monsters they possess.

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.411
Their attack points
went up?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.511
Hey, what gives?

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:42.011
What gives is our trademark
Magnet Monsters'

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:43.477
special abilities, Yuma.

00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.511
Allow me to break it down...

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:48.111
See, if any of our Magnet
Monsters are destroyed,

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:49.777
each of the remaining
Magnet Monsters

00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.011
gain 400 attack points!

00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.844
Pretty cunning,
don't you think?

00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:00.211
Allow me to demonstrate
for you.

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:03.144
Magnet Saucer,
attack his Gagaga Caesar!

00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:10.244
They were both destroyed!

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:11.611
Which is what they want!

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.144
Now, my Magnet Eagle's attack
points soar to 2,000

00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:16.511
because Magnet Saucer
was destroyed!

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:17.811
Attack him directly!

00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:24.611
What's the matter, Yuma, getting
a little hot under the collar?

00:05:24.644 --> 00:05:26.911
Well, you'll cool off
now that my attack points

00:05:26.944 --> 00:05:28.411
return to normal.

00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.077
Oh come now, Yuma, I know you
can do better than this.

00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:35.744
I want to see everything
that you can do, my boy.

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.782
If you're just joining us,
Duel Fans,

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:49.416
you won't wanna miss another
second of the action!

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.183
It's Yuma Tsukumo taking on
The Triple Threat Offensive

00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:53.683
of the
Triad of Terror!

00:05:53.716 --> 00:05:54.816
The poor guy!

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.249
<i>It's not fair.</i>

00:05:56.283 --> 00:05:58.983
<i>How long can this plucky,
outmatched kid hold on!</i>

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.816
There's only one way
to find out!

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.683
Keep it right
here, Duel Fans!

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:05.683
Do not miss this duel!

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.083
Do your thing,
Magnet Ape Epsilon!

00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:13.616
You too,
Magnet Crocodile Zeta!

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.149
(both)
Come on out!

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:25.183
Oh great, two more monsters
to deal with!

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:27.249
Even if I can destroy
them somehow...

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.083
The other Magnet Monsters
these three possess

00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:31.183
will gain attack points.

00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:33.183
So, I'm in trouble...

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:34.149
No, Yuma...

00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:36.616
Not if you play
Gogogo Golem.

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.883
Remember, if you play
it in defense mode,

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:41.583
then your Golem cannot be
destroyed once per turn.

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:43.083
That's right!

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:45.583
If I do that, then I'll give
myself a chance to change lanes

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:47.583
and get away from these
three goons...

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.483
So now I summon
Gogogo Golem!

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:00.349
Coyote, take care of that thing
for us, would you?

00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:03.249
Crocodile Zeta,
attack Gogogo Golem!

00:07:03.283 --> 00:07:04.349
Bolt Bite!

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.583
Hang in there,
Gogogo Golem!

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:13.516
Now, Ape Epsilon,
attack Gogogo Golem as well!

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:15.749
Ape Punch!

00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:17.083
Seize the moment!

00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:19.483
Change lanes now before you
take another attack!

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:20.616
Oh yeah!

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:24.116
Ha, the kid's tryin'
to change lanes.

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:25.749
Guess he's as
dumb as he looks...

00:07:25.783 --> 00:07:27.183
Are you ready, Coyote?

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:30.383
Hit it!

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:33.149
Oh no!

00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:34.716
I can't lose 'em...

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:37.649
More of the Triad of Terror's
tricky Teamwork!

00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:40.483
That Yuma kid has only
1,000 life points left

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:43.116
and my Magnet Eagle has 1,200
attack points.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.616
If my direct attack
on him succeeds, then...

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:47.749
We stand to make
serious bank!

00:07:47.783 --> 00:07:49.983
Aww yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:52.383
Yuma!

00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:54.449
What do I do?
Ahhh!

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.249
This ends now!

00:07:58.283 --> 00:07:59.416
Go, Magnet Eagle!

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:00.783
Attack Yuma directly!

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:06.116
What's that?

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:14.416
What's this all about?

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:15.416
Huh?

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:16.816
Hey, who are you?

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.283
Someone who's gonna help
you even the odds up.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:23.716
Long time no see, Yuma!

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:25.216
No way!
It can't be.

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:26.449
It's Anna!

00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:27.916
Anna Kapow!

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:31.149
First she wanted to blow me up
and now she wants to team up?

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:33.583
Don't tell me you're in
the Duel Carnival too...

00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:34.916
I'll explain later.

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:37.016
We're kinda in the middle
of a duel here, Yuma.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.983
Go, Rocket Arrow!

00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:41.283
5,000 attack points?

00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:43.249
No sweat, I got this...

00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:01.083
You saved me, Anna!
But how did you do it?

00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:03.483
I thought you weren't dueling
in the carnival?

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:05.549
It's an interesting
story...

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.016
I'll explain later.

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:08.716
Oh, this I gotta hear!

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.716
What was that?
No one attacked.

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:14.683
How'd that happen?

00:09:14.716 --> 00:09:17.283
After a battle, Rocket Arrow
Express will always

00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:19.416
self-destruct, unless,
of course its owner sends

00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:21.549
five cards in their hand
to the graveyard.

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:22.716
Oh great!

00:09:22.749 --> 00:09:24.983
Looks like Anna forgot what
her card can do.

00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:28.349
Okay my bad, but we'll win,
don't sweat it!

00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:30.916
I think you're the one
who's gonna be sweating!

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:32.516
Sweating bullets that is,

00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:35.749
when I activate the spell
Magnet Reborn!

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.616
And soon you'll
be crying, too!

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:39.483
'Cause now by paying
500 life points,

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:42.583
I can call out Crocodile
Zeta from my graveyard.

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.916
Put the bite on 'em,
Crocodile Zeta!

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:47.349
Whoa! Anna!
Look out for that croc!

00:09:53.483 --> 00:09:55.783
We'll put you in a world of hurt
for sticking your neck out

00:09:55.816 --> 00:09:56.916
for Yuma.

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:01.316
Anna, you reached
the Draw Lane!

00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:02.516
You gotta pick a card now!

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:03.816
Here goes...

00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:07.583
I summon out Lionhearted
Locomotive in attack mode!

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:14.283
Your choo-choo train doesn't
scare me!

00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:17.349
Especially since I'm activating
the spell card Magnet Fusion

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.849
from my hand!

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:22.649
I tribute Magnet Eagle,

00:10:22.683 --> 00:10:26.316
Crocodile Zeta
and Ape Epsilon

00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:29.216
to summon Electromagnetic
Magnedragon!

00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:33.516
Whoa, that's all
types of bad news!

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:35.083
Uh-oh,
Anna's in trouble!

00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:36.316
That's right!

00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:38.116
And this time it's my turn
to save her!

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:40.316
So I draw!

00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:42.916
And now I summon
Bull Blader!

00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:47.983
Uh-oh,
here comes trouble!

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:52.949
Jackal!

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:55.549
I bet you guys
missed me, huh?

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.616
It's my turn, kid!

00:10:57.649 --> 00:10:58.983
I draw!

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:01.016
And I summon
Magnet Mannequin!

00:11:05.983 --> 00:11:09.616
My turn now and I summon
Magnet Jammer!

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.583
I've been waitin' for this!

00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:18.183
Magnedragon, attack Lionhearted
Locomotive!

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:19.949
Magne Inferno!

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.549
When Magnedragon destroys
a monster,

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:28.116
you take damage equal
to the destroyed monster's

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:30.016
attack points.

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:32.983
Anna!

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.021
Oh no.

00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:39.722
Anna needs your
help, Yuma!

00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:44.522
Yuma,
please be careful!

00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:45.922
You are surrounded.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.155
But not for long!

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:48.388
Watch this!

00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:51.222
Alright, Bull Blader,
do your thing!

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:53.388
Attack Magnet Mannequin!

00:11:56.788 --> 00:11:59.855
Thanks, you just activated
Mannequin's special ability!

00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:03.755
When it's destroyed, you take
200 points of damage.

00:12:07.355 --> 00:12:10.222
And to show you you can't
keep a good monster down,

00:12:10.255 --> 00:12:14.588
I'll activate the spell card
Magnet Reborn from my hand!

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:18.588
By paying 500 life points, I can
bring back Magnet Mannequin

00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:20.022
from the graveyard!

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:21.655
Now we'll just
keep on attacking

00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:23.722
till we hack away all your
life points!

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.755
Ah, you wouldn't
dare do it!

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:27.622
You'll lose all
your life points!

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:29.688
I don't need 'em.

00:12:29.722 --> 00:12:31.822
We're a team, remember?

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:33.988
Even if "our"
life points run out,

00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:36.388
Wolfsbane's will
remain solid!

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.722
And crushing you means a big
payday for all of us!

00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:41.288
What big payday?

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:42.322
A payday?

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:43.722
What could he mean, Yuma?

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:46.488
We don't care about the World
Duel Carnival, Yuma!

00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:48.422
Think of us as
duel bounty hunters.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:50.422
We take punks like you on
for cash.

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:52.855
Someone's paying them?
Who's got it out for me?

00:12:52.888 --> 00:12:54.322
C'mon, you gotta tell me!

00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:56.055
(all)
Wouldn't you like to know?

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.055
I draw!

00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:02.422
(Anna)
This is the only card I can
summon right now...

00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:04.455
Please let this do the trick.

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:08.555
I play Express Train Trolley
Olley, in defense mode.

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:13.688
1,000 defense points.

00:13:13.722 --> 00:13:15.022
Ha!

00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:17.555
Get real, that can't defend
against my Magnedragon!

00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:21.055
Go, Bull Blader!

00:13:21.088 --> 00:13:22.955
Attack Magnet Mannequin!

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:29.388
(Jackal)
Don't you remember,
you lose 200 life points

00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:31.722
if you take out
Magnet Mannequin.

00:13:31.755 --> 00:13:33.522
Face it, you've lost!

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:35.388
You can't take down
the Triad of Terror!

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:36.822
He's right!

00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:39.455
It's just a matter of time
before we take you down!

00:13:39.488 --> 00:13:41.422
I really hate to admit it,

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:43.388
but "goggles" back there
may have a point.

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:44.622
Agreed.

00:13:44.655 --> 00:13:46.355
We are in dire straits.

00:13:46.388 --> 00:13:47.922
Say goodbye!

00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:51.255
This is bad!

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:52.955
Hey, what's up, Yuma?

00:13:52.988 --> 00:13:53.922
Need a hand?

00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:59.722
Heroic Challenger Spartan,
attack Magnet Jammer!

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.555
Nistro?
Who's this?

00:14:01.588 --> 00:14:02.888
It's a new guest!

00:14:02.922 --> 00:14:05.788
So this calls for a quick
change of plans!

00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:09.322
Magnet Jammer's ability returns
our monsters to our hands!

00:14:09.355 --> 00:14:11.622
Thanks, Nistro,
you're just in time!

00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:16.755
Now with Nistro, the odds
are finally fair.

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:19.422
You're up!I know!

00:14:19.455 --> 00:14:21.855
Now, Bull Blader attack!

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:24.855
Why bother?

00:14:24.888 --> 00:14:26.355
How do you plan to beat
Magnedragon's

00:14:26.388 --> 00:14:30.455
3,500 attack points with Bull
Blader's 1,600 attack points?

00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:33.488
(Yuma)
Well, why don't you watch
and learn, "Wolf Lame"?

00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:36.222
You see, Bull Blader can stop
Magnedragon's battle damage

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:37.488
and destroy it!

00:14:37.522 --> 00:14:38.655
Why you dirty...

00:14:45.354 --> 00:14:46.954
I don't know about you gents,

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:50.521
but I am getting a little sick
and tired of this Yuma kid.

00:14:50.554 --> 00:14:52.987
What do you say we finish
him off once and for all?

00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:54.087
Roger!
Roger!

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:55.521
I draw!
I draw!

00:14:55.554 --> 00:14:57.587
I summon Magnet Chameleon!
I summon Magnet Chameleon!

00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:06.354
Funny thing about having two
Magnet Chameleons...

00:15:06.387 --> 00:15:08.887
They negate your monster's
special ability!

00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:11.487
So Bull Blader's
useless to you now...

00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:13.054
Uh-oh!

00:15:13.087 --> 00:15:14.754
We'll see how
"useless" it is!

00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:16.021
I draw!

00:15:16.054 --> 00:15:18.954
I summon Heroic Challenger,
Extra Sword!

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.421
Try this on
for size, chump!

00:15:32.454 --> 00:15:34.321
Coyote!
This is bad!

00:15:37.387 --> 00:15:40.054
(Astral)
Yuma, I may know why Nistro
stepped in to save you

00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:42.321
from that attack.
Yeah...

00:15:42.354 --> 00:15:44.954
Your Bull Blader,
Anna's Trolley Olley

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:48.021
and Nistro's Extra Sword
are all Level 4.

00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:50.487
If there are three Level 4
monsters on the field,

00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:52.854
you can Xyz Summon...

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.021
All right!

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.954
I overlay Level 4 Bull Blader,

00:15:55.987 --> 00:15:59.321
Anna's Trolley Olley
and Nistro's Extra Sword!

00:16:04.887 --> 00:16:08.121
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:11.121
And Xyz Summon the mighty...

00:16:11.154 --> 00:16:13.054
One-Eyed Skill Gainer!

00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:24.187
2,500 attack points.

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:28.187
With my Magnedragon at 3,500,
whatever will I do?

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:31.487
You'll freak out, since Yuma
used Extra Sword to Xyz Summon,

00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.187
One-Eyed Skill Gainer gains
1,000 attack points!

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:36.521
And my Trolley Olley's
special ability

00:16:36.554 --> 00:16:38.787
adds an extra
800 attack points...

00:16:43.954 --> 00:16:45.221
I don't believe it!

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.387
That makes
4,300 attack points!

00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:49.987
Yuma, you are
forgetting something.

00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:51.354
Oh yeah!

00:16:51.387 --> 00:16:54.454
I also activate Skill Gainer's
special ability!

00:16:54.487 --> 00:16:59.287
By using one Overlay unit, it'll
gain your Magnedragon's powers.

00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:02.554
So thanks for bringing
Magnedragon to the party.

00:17:06.054 --> 00:17:08.054
This cannot be happening!

00:17:08.087 --> 00:17:10.221
Magnedragon's special ability
deals damage

00:17:10.254 --> 00:17:13.154
equal to the attack points of
the monster that it destroys.

00:17:13.187 --> 00:17:15.954
If I take 800 points of damage
from battle

00:17:15.987 --> 00:17:17.987
and then take 3,500
points of damage

00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:20.487
from the special ability...

00:17:20.521 --> 00:17:23.421
I'll be completely wiped out,
in a single turn!

00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.921
So how does it feel to know
that your trio is gonna lose

00:17:25.954 --> 00:17:27.754
the duel, Wolfsbane?

00:17:27.787 --> 00:17:29.321
We ain't losing!

00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:31.521
Oh no?

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.921
If Wolfsbane survives,
we can still win!

00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:47.787
No, Jackal!

00:17:49.421 --> 00:17:50.587
I'm out of here!

00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:55.221
That's right, run away!

00:17:55.254 --> 00:17:56.354
You chicken!

00:17:56.387 --> 00:17:57.587
Heh, he took off.

00:17:57.621 --> 00:17:59.421
We won't be seeing anymore
of that creep.

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.754
Ah, yeah, well...

00:18:00.787 --> 00:18:02.254
We would have
won it anyway.

00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:08.054
No one saw this coming!

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:11.121
Yuma Tsukumo, joined by two
last-minute teammates,

00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:15.254
beat the terrifying
Triad of Terror!

00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:17.021
Yahoo, Yuma did it!

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.254
Atta boy, Yuma!

00:18:18.287 --> 00:18:20.421
You guys were amazing!

00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:23.087
(Wolfsbane)
This is not over!

00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.321
I still aim to finish
the job, Yuma!

00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:30.554
(Nistro)
So if I got this right,
you're not even in

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:32.687
the World Duel
Carnival, Anna?

00:18:32.721 --> 00:18:34.621
Not exactly.

00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:36.187
But you found
someone who was,

00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:37.654
tied them up so they
couldn't escape,

00:18:37.687 --> 00:18:39.187
and then
pretended to be them?

00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:41.454
Gee Anna, that's kind of
extreme...

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.054
Oh yeah, well, so what?

00:18:44.087 --> 00:18:47.854
I guess I-- I just wanted
to see you again.

00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:49.954
Heads up,
he's back, you guys!

00:18:51.787 --> 00:18:53.254
It's Magnedragon!

00:18:53.287 --> 00:18:55.187
I was hoping we'd seen
the last of it!

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:02.399
It's Magnedragon!

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.499
I was hoping we'd seen
the last of it!

00:19:04.533 --> 00:19:07.066
You didn't think I'd take off
without finishing the job,

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:08.099
did you?

00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:09.499
Oh no, brace yourselves!

00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:13.299
I activate the spell Direct
Magnet from my hand!

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:15.499
By paying
half my life points

00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:18.933
and cutting Magnedragon's
attack points in half,

00:19:18.966 --> 00:19:21.833
it can now
attack you directly!

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:23.133
Take this!

00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:34.099
I summon Construction
Train Signal Red!

00:19:34.133 --> 00:19:37.766
Now Magnedragon is forced to
attack Construction Train

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.833
instead of my
sweetie-pie Yuma!

00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:46.833
(Yuma)
Anna!

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:51.266
Anna...

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.333
If my attack
didn't damage you,

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:58.766
ramming my coaster car
into you will!

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:02.066
Now, Skill Gainer, attack!

00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:28.333
Oh, yeah!

00:20:28.366 --> 00:20:30.333
(Anna)
We beat 'em again!

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:32.833
(Yuma)
That's right and we couldn't
have done it without you, Anna.

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:37.233
I believe in you, Yuma.

00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:38.833
You can win
the whole carnival!

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.633
Don't prove me wrong!

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.033
I think
she likes you, Yuma.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.566
Yuma is powerful indeed...

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:57.899
But his reliance on the power
of friendship

00:20:57.933 --> 00:20:59.866
will be his undoing.

00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:03.666
And now we go from the sunny
skies of the SkyScape Section

00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:06.799
to deep underground into
the Dragon's Den!

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:08.399
Stay with us, Duel Fans.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.133
You won't want to miss
a second!

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:16.699
I am so feeling
the flow!
