defeat that Dragon.

Next, from my hand, I play the

No fair, how's it still on the

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.567
the one with higher
points wins, right?

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:56.767
What gives?

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:59.633
I took down your monster fair
and square.

Afraid not.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.300
A number monster

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.867
can only be beat by
another number monster.

00:07:05.867 --> 00:07:07.033
For real?

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:09.767
But...I don't have any number
monsters.

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:11.800
So that Dragon's on the field

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.033
for good?

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.033
This is big time bad.

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:19.767
if I can't beat shark's monster,

00:07:19.767 --> 00:07:21.867
then how am I supposed
to beat shark?

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.433
How indeed?

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:27.067
And you had better start
figuring that out

00:07:27.067 --> 00:07:30.700
because shark looks
ready to attack.

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.800
Shark is gearing up to attack.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.133
Better do something.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.700
Or you are through.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.633
And what makes you a dueling
expert all of a sudden?

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:56.633
are less than skillful.

00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:58.633
That's not True!

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:00.267
Well, actually

00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:01.767
kinda is.

00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:03.900
That is the first correct thing
you have said.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.767
Well, no hard feelings then.

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.167
First, what?

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.367
Who do you think you are?

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:10.933
It's my turn now isn't it?

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:12.467
I draw.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.167
I summon drill barnacle!

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.533
300 attack points.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:21.933
You are lucky.

00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:23.933
What do you mean
I'm lucky?

00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:26.233
I activate my Dragon's ability.

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.167
So by using an overlay unit

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:32.133
I can power up leviathan
Dragon's strength.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:33.867
3000 points now?

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.633
Whoa.

00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:37.600
Since shark's leviathan Dragon

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.067
had one last Overlay Unit
remaining

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:41.900
it was obvious what he would do.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.200
Just as it's obvious what he
will do now.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.567
What?

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.100
It's time, leviathan Dragon.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.367
Attack gogogo golem!

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:57.700
[Explosions]

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.933
just 800 points left

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.733
guess this guy was right about
me being lucky.

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:06.800
I'm not finished yet, yuma.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.433
Drill barnacle.

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:12.300
Dig in.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.967
Ahhhh!

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.700
Yuma

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.833
for your information, when in
defense mode,that golem

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:24.700
has an effect that prevents it
from being destroyed in battle.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.300
Now do you understand

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.967
why I suggested you bring him
out in defense mode?

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.867
You are not very good at this.

00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:33.167
Be quiet!

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:34.867
Oh my, what's this?

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:39.233
My life force seems to be
draining away.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.833
-Numbers
-Huh?

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:49.800
They're the key

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.333
the key to unlocking
my sealed memory

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:58.533
you see, numbers are special
cards, even among xyz monsters.

00:09:58.533 --> 00:10:02.133
They cannot be defeated like
regular cards

00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:04.967
and in a duel where numbers
cards are used

00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:08.367
the Winner absorbs the loser's
number cards.

00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.033
Where you going with this?

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:12.133
I don't know for sure

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:15.900
all I do know is you must win.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.067
Ahh.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.833
Otherwise, I will meet a very
bad end.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:22.367
Thanks a lot, no pressure or
anything.

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:23.900
Alright, let's see here.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.233
I don't have the cards for a
counterattack

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:28.800
which means I'll just have to
cross my fingers and hope

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.167
that I can survive attacks from
both Leviathan Dragon and Drill

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:34.200
Barnacle until I do.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.200
While you think things over

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.100
I activate drill barnacle's
effect.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.033
Because it was able to deal
damage to you,

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:44.767
it now gains 1000 attack points.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:46.767
But just wait,
yuma, there's more.

00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:49.767
Drill barnacle's a monster that
can attack you directly.

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:51.200
Which means on the next turn,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.900
if that attack connects,
you're through!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.200
Nuts!

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.300
I wasn't planning for a direct
attack.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.300
What do I do?

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.967
What do I do?

00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:01.200
Hey!

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.567
I'll play my facedown,
that's what.

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.600
Hm, now what'd I
throw down again?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.467
You played Bye Bye damage.

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.367
And had you activated it
earlier,

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:12.500
you would have dealt
damage to shark

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.533
and gogogo Golem would not have
been destroyed.

00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:18.833
Well maybe I was distracted
'cause of all your blabbin'

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:21.667
speaking of, how about you zip
it and duel

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.367
you stay outta this.

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.700
Stay outta what exactly?

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.933
My talk with my
invisible friend!

00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:30.800
You know what's gonna be
invisible, as in vanished?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.567
Your life points.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.833
Nope, still there.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:35.000
But not for long.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.567
Unless

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:39.267
you start listening to me for
some dueling advice, yuma!

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:40.500
Not later.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.000
Now.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.033
Can you at least say 'please'?

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:46.567
Stop making dumb
mistakes...Please.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:47.933
That's not what I meant.

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:49.267
Just go away!

00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:51.567
On your next draw, we need a
card that allows you

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:53.967
to summon more
than once this turn.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:55.567
A card that lets me do what?

00:11:55.567 --> 00:11:57.933
Special summon a monster.

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:00.567
Fine, I'll try!

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:03.767
Alright for the sake of both my
and bronk's decks!

00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:04.933
Here goes!

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.167
I draw!

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:08.667
Monster reborn.

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:11.433
It seems that fate has come
through for me this time.

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:13.667
But I'm the one who drew it!

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:18.133
I summon ganbara Knight in
attack mode!

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:19.600
Yuma?

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.067
Why'D ya go with attack mode?

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:23.933
Ganbara Knight has
zero attack points!

00:12:23.933 --> 00:12:25.533
Huh, aw.

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.433
Just give up, yuma

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:29.033
you can't win.

00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:31.233
Sorry, shark but
I never give up!

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:34.333
Feeling the flow means fighting
'til the very end!

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:35.667
Feeling the flow?

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.267
That's right, feeling the flow,
it's kinda my motto!

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:40.700
It's about doing
what can't be done.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.100
Like right now.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.100
I'm gonna find a
way to win this!

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.733
You're wrong!

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:48.000
The only thing you're
going to find, yuma

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.267
is the bitter taste of
disappointment

00:12:50.267 --> 00:12:51.767
and do you know why?

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:53.567
Because I have two monsters on
the field

00:12:53.567 --> 00:12:58.533
and you have one, with zero
attack points!

00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:00.133
It's fine.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:02.667
It's good that ganbara Knight's
on offense

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:05.333
it gives us a chance to turn
things around.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:06.667
Perhaps

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:08.567
perhaps?

00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:11.333
Quick, bring back gagaga
magician with monster reborn.

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.767
What?

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:17.433
There's no time to argue, you
must trust me! Please.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.867
Yeah, well, I was gonna
do that anyhow.

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:28.033
From my hand, I activate the
spell card monster reborn!

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:31.333
And with it, I bring
back gagaga magician!

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:32.733
So what?

00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:36.400
His 1500 attack points are no
threat to me!

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.867
At last, the stage is set

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:38.867
for what?

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:40.333
Teamwork.

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:43.167
Overlay level 4 gagaga magician
and ganbara Knight.

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:46.067
Hang on a sec
is this what I think?

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:48.800
Look at your deck, yuma.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:50.833
Whoa

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:53.067
it looks like an xyz monster

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:55.500
but I can't quite
make out which one

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.633
I can.

00:13:56.633 --> 00:14:01.433
It's number 39: Utopia.

00:14:01.433 --> 00:14:03.933
Hey is this...a number card?

00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:05.167
It is.

00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:07.133
And now it belongs to you, yuma.

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:09.667
Then let's see what
this baby's got.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:12.400
Cuz, I'm feelin'
the flow big time!

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.667
I overlay level 4 gagaga
magician and ganbara Knight!

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:22.067
And now that I have, I can make
do a little xyz summoning!

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:24.133
So here goes

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.300
rise on up

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.800
number 39

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.100
utopia!

00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:38.367
[♪..]

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:52.567
time to take out shark's
monster, utopia!

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:55.000
Attack Drill barnacle!

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:03.867
Go Rising sun slash!

00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:12.133
Yeah!

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:13.867
You got number crunched.

00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:15.333
How dare you.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.733
Our job isn't finished yet

00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:21.967
now to introduce utopia to
leviathan Dragon

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.233
another number Monster?

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:36.933
Where'd it come from?

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:39.767
I don't remember yuma having
that card before.

00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:40.967
Same here.

00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:42.567
Too weird

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.567
alrighty, shark, I end my turn.

00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:48.933
How cool am I?

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:51.233
I just made an xyz summon!

00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:52.567
Bronk, Tori.

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:53.833
Tell me you saw that.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:55.000
Yeah, we saw it

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.633
wasn't it cool?

00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:00.100
I am so feeling the
flow right now.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.900
That's great, but...

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.200
utopia has 2500 attack points
Leviathan Dragon has 3000.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.333
If shark attacks, it's over.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.833
Oh yeah!

00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:11.100
That's bad!

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.533
Very bad, especially since now,
it's my turn!

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:17.667
I draw!

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:21.333
From my hand, I activate the
spell card surface.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.833
And since I did, a water monster
now surfaces from my graveyard.

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:28.167
Welcome back, big jaws.

00:16:33.467 --> 00:16:34.967
[roaring]

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:38.100
But he won't be back for long, I
now release him

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.200
and tribute summon jawsman.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.700
Tribute summon?

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.067
Yeah, it's a when ya forfeit a
monster on the field

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.233
to bring out a
higher level monster.

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:49.267
[roaring]

00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:53.967
now jawsman Gains 300 attack
points

00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:56.667
for every other water monster on
my field.

00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.267
I have one, leviathan Dragon.

00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:04.033
So jawsman powers up
2900 attack points.

00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:05.600
Now to put them to use.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.333
Leviathan Dragon attack utopia.

00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:13.133
Oh well, it was nice while it
lasted, utopia.

00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.600
If you use utopia's
overlay Unit

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.367
utopia will put a stop to
leviathan Dragon's attack.

00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:20.867
Now you tell me?

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:23.433
I activate utopia's special
ability

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:25.133
by using an overlay unit

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:30.267
to negate leviathan
Dragon's attack.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:40.900
Go light wing shield!

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.233
So you bought yourself
some time

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.633
but that time will
eventually run out!

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:48.600
Your monster's not
strong enough to beat mine.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.967
Yeah, I guess shark
kinda has a point

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:53.867
and you only have
one overlay unit left

00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:55.367
to protect yourself with...

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:59.033
So when it's gone, you're life
points will be gone too.

00:17:59.033 --> 00:18:01.933
And it looks like This is gonna
happen sooner than later...

00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:04.200
'cause you're gonna have to use
it up right now

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.800
to protect yourself
from jawsman.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.067
Or utopia is fish food.

00:18:08.067 --> 00:18:09.667
What are you waiting for, yuma?

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.667
Use utopia's special ability!

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:16.167
Yeah, I could do
that or I could

00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:17.500
do this!

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.667
I play the trap

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.200
Bye Bye damage!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.867
Which means my monster
can say Bye-Bye

00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:27.467
to being destroyed this turn.

00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:29.833
I told you to use
utopia's ability.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:32.367
I don't always do as I'm told.

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:38.800
Course my life points still take
a hit from jawsman's attack

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.500
but you take the same damage,
only doubled.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.100
What?

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.167
Yuma only has 100
life points left.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:51.067
Thanks for playing that trap,
yuma because now

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.867
I can play my trap,
booming urchin!

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:58.300
And it really does pack a punch
because come my turn.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.267
You'll be blasted with 1000
points of damage

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:03.833
and I'll win this.

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:04.833
Aw

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:06.533
that's a major bummer.

00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:07.933
Oh no

00:19:07.933 --> 00:19:09.367
yuma

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:12.000
your deck is mine!

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:26.100
Face it, yuma

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.600
you have lost.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.833
Not yet.

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.633
I'm not giving up.

00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:32.100
Far from it.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.967
Cuz I'm feeling the flow.

00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:36.133
And now

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.233
you're gonna feel something.

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:40.633
And here it comes.

00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:43.167
The sting of defeat!

00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:47.300
Ahhh! Ohh!

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.633
Alright!

00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:50.600
Goooo!

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.167
Utopia, attack leviathan Dragon!

00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:56.567
Oh my!

00:19:56.967 --> 00:19:58.233
Why's he attacking?

00:19:58.233 --> 00:20:00.267
That yuma, he never
stops to think!

00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:04.500
And now I activate
utopia's ability

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.667
and use an overlay unit to
negate that attack.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:11.333
You're a duel fool, why would
you negate an attack

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.833
that you just ordered.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.700
I'll show you why.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.167
Now, from my hand.

00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:20.167
I'm playing the spell
double or nothing.

00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:22.833
Where are you going with this?

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:25.867
It's not where I'm going, it's
where utopia's going

00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:27.933
cuz since I stopped his attack
before,

00:20:27.933 --> 00:20:31.833
his strength is now doubled, and
he gets to attack again.

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.267
5000 attack points?

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:38.600
Now go, utopia!

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.167
Attack leviathan Dragon with
rising Sun slash!

00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:47.733
[Yelling]

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.333
Hey, did iwin?

00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.367
Did he?

00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:03.300
He did!

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.867
Yea!!!

00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:06.933
I did it!

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:10.400
I beat shark!

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.167
Minion A: Shark lost
to that nobody?

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.233
Minion B: Let's ditch this dork!

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.133
Yes, it is as I thought.

00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:34.233
This number card represents a
piece of my memory.

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:36.400
But just a small piece.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.367
For my memory to truly return,

00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:42.533
I must collect All
99 number cards.

00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:45.767
Woohoo!!

00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:46.967
you're incredible!

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:48.967
You did it! Alright!

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:50.267
I can't believe it

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:52.567
I've lost.

00:21:54.033 --> 00:21:58.467
mom, dad thank you.

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:00.567
Shark

00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:02.933
we had a deal.

00:22:02.933 --> 00:22:04.600
Thank you.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.200
And thank you for
keeping your word.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.900
You're a good duelist.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.300
I'll see ya around.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.533
Thanks.

00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:14.700
And, hey, maybe we can do
this again sometime.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.867
Only, forget the decks

00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:19.533
let's just duel for good ol'
fashioned fun!

00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:22.767
That's the best way
to feel the flow.

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:24.033
You may have a point.

00:22:24.033 --> 00:22:25.633
Till then, yuma

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:29.000
you were feeling the flow on
that last draw, weren't you?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.700
That's why you risked everything

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.767
yes?

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:32.967
Kind of

00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:35.367
but I also just wanted to give
you a scare

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:37.200
which I did.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.267
And it was fun!

00:22:39.267 --> 00:22:41.167
I have a feeling this is the
beginning

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:43.033
of a beautiful friendship.

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:45.267
If...you do as I say.

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:46.333
Huh!

00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:47.933
Errrr!

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:49.033
Do as you say?!

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:51.367
not a chance!
