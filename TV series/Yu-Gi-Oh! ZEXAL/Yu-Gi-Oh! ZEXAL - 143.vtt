WEBVTT

00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.135
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.737
When you take on me,

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:07.672
you take on all seven
Barian Emperors.

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:12.109
Together, we can summon
our most powerful monster,

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.512
Chaos Xyz Barian Hope.

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.749
Even with the power of ZEXAL,
I'll still beat you.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.654
Hey, Earth's heading this way
even faster than before!

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.288
Kazuma Tsukumo,

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:31.024
the three worlds
will be destroyed

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.759
unless we do
something about it.

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:35.293
(Kazuma) Yuma!
Huh?

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:36.728
(Kazuma) Help is on the way.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.197
We'll hold back these worlds
as long as we can!

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:44.634
(Kazuma)
Keep on dueling, Yuma,
the future is in your hands.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.736
(Yuma) Arise anew, Number 39.

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:50.739
Utopia Beyond!

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.675
Rising Sun Beyond Slash!

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:55.743
No!

00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:00.546
You dare destroy the bond
I have with my friends♪!

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:04.715
I will make you pay!

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:06.651

Yuma, Astral,

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.399
I will get my revenge!

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:16.103
You will never defeat me.

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:20.707
I activate Reincarnation
of the Seven Emperors!

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.208
By banishing Barian Hope

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.577
and all his
Chaos Overlay Units,

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:28.379
I take no damage.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.982
Man, nothing fazes him.

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:33.717
Oh, it gets even better, Yuma.

00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:36.585
I also get to summon
an Xyz monster.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:40.021
And you take damage
equal to its attack points.

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.725
Come on out, Black Ray Lancer.

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:49.962
It's over for you.

00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:51.697
Oh, no, it isn't!

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:55.433
I activate Utopia Beyond's
special ability.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.134
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:58.969
Utopia Beyond banishes itself

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.006
to revive Utopia
from my graveyard.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.708
And check this out,

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.710
I also gain life points.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.710
How do you like that?

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:12.513
About as much
as you'll like this.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:13.647
Black Ray Lancer,

00:03:13.647 --> 00:03:17.716
attack Yuma with
Shimmering Spear Slash.

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:20.319
(screaming)

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:26.223
(panting)

00:03:26.223 --> 00:03:27.324
I may not have much left,

00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:30.626
but I have more than enough
to take you down.

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:37.532
Your move.

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:39.667
Hey, Shark,

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.703
Utopia and Lancer bring
back memories, don't they?

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:46.039
The first time
we ever teamed up,

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.472
they fought side by side.

00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:50.474
Then our two monsters
combined into one,

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:53.711
and we won
thanks to our teamwork.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.681
What? It was more work
than teamwork.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.949
I had to carry you so much
through the entire duel

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.950
that I still get back spasms.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.486
One of the worst
days of my life.

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:07.154
But it was a great day for me

00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:09.656
because that's when
I made a friend.

00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:10.557
So come on,

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:13.693
let's stop fighting
and be friends again.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:18.329
Sorry, but I'm not
stopping this duel.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.197
Huh?

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:21.365
To be honest, Yuma,

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:24.400
I do think we're friends.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.301
Huh?

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:26.703
And I hope you
loved hearing that

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:28.403
because I'll never
say it again.

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:32.540
You see, we can't go back
to the way things used to be.

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:34.141
Why not?

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.210
Because, as the leader
of the Barians,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.012
I have a new group of friends.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.679
They're still
fighting by my side,

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:43.082
counting on me to
protect our home world.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:46.017
And I promised that
I wouldn't let them down.

00:04:46.017 --> 00:04:49.252
You and Astral share
an unbreakable bond,

00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:51.221
but ours is stronger.

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:53.689
I won't lose them again.

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.658
Lose them again?

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:57.992
(Door)
Whoever can open this door

00:04:57.992 --> 00:05:00.528
will gain a great new power.

00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:03.130
But know with such a reward

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.631
comes great risk.

00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:06.132
You would lose that

00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:09.668
which is most valuable to you.

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:11.670
Yuma?

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.107
(Yuma's thinking)
What did I have to lose
to get the power of ZEXAL?

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.309
I can't think
about that right now.

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.411
I gotta focus on this duel.

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:23.679
My turn!

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:26.114
I draw!

00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:30.417
My Utopia attacks
your Black Ray Lancer.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.653
That's not happening
because I banish

00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:38.356
Friller Rabca to activate
its special ability.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:40.291
It not only stops your attack,

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.428
but your Utopia loses
500 attack points.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.997
(groaning)

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:52.134
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:53.001
Okay, great.

00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:56.103
Since you're finally done
reminiscing about the past,

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:59.439
let's determine our
future once and for all.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.374
(groaning)

00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:04.076
A future where
Barian World rules

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:08.079
and Astral World is extinct.

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:13.884
Astral World
will be nothing more

00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:17.653
than a meaningless footnote
in Barian World's history.

00:06:17.653 --> 00:06:20.455
(groaning) My turn.

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:23.124
I draw!

00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:25.259
Hmm.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.127
I activate the spell

00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:28.661
Xyz Treasure.

00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:33.198
I get to draw a card for
every Xyz Monster in play.

00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:36.367
So that means I draw two cards.

00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:37.034
(grunts)

00:06:37.034 --> 00:06:38.669
And whenever I play a spell,

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:41.638
I automatically
get to summon Big Jaws.

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:46.308
It was chomping at the bit
to get in on the action.

00:06:46.308 --> 00:06:50.344
Next, I summon Skull Kraken.

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:56.650
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.284
I Xyz Summon

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:02.487
Submersible Carrier Aero Shark.

00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:04.589
(roaring)

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.158
And my Aero Shark
has a present for you.

00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:09.659
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.929
you take 400 points of damage
for every card in my hand.

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:16.398
(roaring)

00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:17.599
I may only have one card,

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.634
but 400 points of damage
is enough to finish off

00:07:20.868 --> 00:07:22.635
the rest of your life points.

00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.072
Yuma, no!

00:07:26.072 --> 00:07:29.041
Torpedo Take Down!

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:31.509
Yuma, use your trap now.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:32.143
Got it.

00:07:32.143 --> 00:07:36.046
I activate my Damage Takeover.

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:38.481
Brace yourself, Astral.

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:40.416
(both grunting)

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:42.284
(both screaming)

00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:45.153
We don't take any damage.

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.654
(both grunting)

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:49.423
Then my trap card transforms

00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:53.025
into an Overlay Unit
for Utopia.

00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:56.294
Utopia also loses
400 attack points,

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.630
but at least we're still alive.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.932
Oh, I'll fix that for good.

00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:05.635
Black Ray Lancer,
attack Utopia.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:07.003
I don't think so.

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:09.371
Utopia, protect yourself.

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:14.141
It uses one Overlay Unit
to negate your attack.

00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:16.576
Light Wing Shield.

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:18.912
But now that
it's out of Overlay Units,

00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:21.113
it can't stop any more attacks.

00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:23.616
Aero Shark attacks Utopia.

00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:26.251
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:28.619
Only a Number
can destroy a Number,

00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:31.054
but you still take damage.

00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.289
(groaning)

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:39.160
Yuma! Astral!

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.629
Oh!

00:08:44.498 --> 00:08:47.000
Go ahead and take
your turn, Yuma...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.035
your last turn.

00:08:51.637 --> 00:08:53.971
They're down to 50 life points.

00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:55.606
Are they going to lose?

00:08:55.606 --> 00:08:58.108
(groaning)

00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:02.144
Gotta hand it to him.

00:09:02.144 --> 00:09:05.614
Shark really is one
of the toughest duelist
in the world.

00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:08.616
In the whole galaxy.
Yes, he is.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.185
I'm out of life points
and I'm out of time.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.353
I failed, Astral.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:17.490
I promised to save everyone,
but I failed them all.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.358
My world, Astral World,

00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:22.127
ever Barian World.

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:23.961
I guess promises

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:26.629
are made to be broken.

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:27.563
(gasping)

00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:30.999
(Tori)
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, Yuma!

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:32.100
(gasping)

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.969
You've always said
to keep dueling

00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:37.138
even if you only have
a single life point.

00:09:37.138 --> 00:09:38.939
I know, but...

00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:40.073
But nothing!

00:09:40.073 --> 00:09:43.075
Everyone's counting on you,
so snap out of it!

00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:46.979
And you better not invite me
to your pity party ever again!

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:48.846
Quite a powerful reprimand.

00:09:48.846 --> 00:09:51.448
Shouting can be
very persuasive.

00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:54.251
Yeah, totally.

00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:55.618
But Tori's right.

00:09:55.618 --> 00:09:58.120
My friends fought for me
to get this far,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.288
so I can't give up.

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:03.091
And let's face it,

00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.527
I'd rather face 10 Sharks
than one angry Tori.

00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:09.429
Astral, let's do this.
Of course.

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:11.064
Get ready.
It is time...

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:14.166
(both) To feel the flow.

00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:15.000
(gasping)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.601
(both)
When two distant
souls become one,

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:21.237
the power of ZEXAL is revealed!

00:10:29.043 --> 00:10:32.146
Ultimate ZEXAL Morph.

00:10:39.318 --> 00:10:42.587
It doesn't matter if you
have to power of ZEXAL,

00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:44.889
I'll still crush you.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.957
Yeah? Oh, we'll see.

00:10:46.957 --> 00:10:48.559
A truly powerful duelist

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:50.593
can shape the outcome
of a duel.

00:10:50.593 --> 00:10:52.962
He can even generate
the very cards

00:10:52.962 --> 00:10:55.397
that he needs to draw.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.967
It's now a whole new game.

00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:01.602
Get set to get decked

00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:04.537
with ZEXAL Weapon Sylphid Wing.

00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:07.106
(Astral)
Sylphid Wing
equips onto Utopia

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:10.375
giving it 800 more
attack points.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:24.586
Let's hang that fish
out to dry.

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:26.854
Utopia, destroy Aero Shark.

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.822
That attack might have worked

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:30.257
if I hadn't activated

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:32.592
Rebirth of the Seven Emperors.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:36.595
It lets me tribute
all my Xyz Monsters.

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:37.863
And by doing so,

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:41.165
I can bring back the most
powerful Barian Monster

00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:43.566
that was banished last turn.

00:11:44.567 --> 00:11:46.202
Not again!

00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:48.937
Chaos Xyz Barian Hope,

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:52.106
rise from the ashes.

00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:57.044
They have to fight it again?

00:11:57.044 --> 00:11:59.446
Oh, and it gets worse.

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:00.579
Three of my banished Numbers

00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:04.083
become Barian Hope's
Chaos Overlay Units.

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:06.184
And they each give Barian Hope

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.252
1,000 attack points

00:12:08.252 --> 00:12:11.288
for a total of 3,000.

00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:19.127
Now Barian Hope has more
attack points than your Utopia.

00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:20.961
(grunting) So what?!

00:12:20.961 --> 00:12:25.198
What Yuma means to say
is that we are not concerned.

00:12:25.198 --> 00:12:27.367
Since you summoned
an Xyz Monster,

00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:31.003
Sylphid Wing gives Utopia
1,600 attack points.

00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:34.572
Making it more powerful
than Barian Hope.

00:12:34.572 --> 00:12:35.573
(grunting)

00:12:35.573 --> 00:12:40.077
Utopia, attack Barian Hope
with all your might.

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.581
Like that's going to work.

00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.882
I activate Draw of Fate.

00:12:47.882 --> 00:12:51.251
This trap stops your attack.

00:12:56.522 --> 00:12:59.091
I'll just get you next turn.

00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:00.559
There won't be a next turn

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:02.993
because we both now
have to draw a card.

00:13:02.993 --> 00:13:06.429
And if you don't play that card
by the end of this turn,

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:10.467
you automatically
lose on the spot.

00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:11.934
No way!

00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:14.336
This is it, Yuma.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:15.570
The end of the line.

00:13:15.803 --> 00:13:19.206
Heh, no pressure or anything.

00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:23.542
The fate of the whole duel
rests on our next card.

00:13:28.947 --> 00:13:32.549
Only one of us will
walk away he winner.

00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:34.551
And it will be me.

00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.552
Chaos Draw.

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:38.054
Oh, we'll see.

00:13:38.054 --> 00:13:42.958
Destiny Shining Draw.

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:51.564
(Yuma thinking) This card?

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.066
Why did I draw this card?

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:58.169
Yuma, we are required
to play that card.

00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:01.304
The entire fate of
Astral World depends on it.

00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:03.540
Let us hope it works
in our favor.

00:14:03.773 --> 00:14:06.542
All right, then,
here goes everything.

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:08.877
I activate the spell

00:14:08.877 --> 00:14:10.812
Double or Nothing!

00:14:10.812 --> 00:14:11.312
Hmm.

00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:14.181
This card doubles
Utopia's attack points

00:14:14.181 --> 00:14:16.550
and lets it attack again.

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:23.555
(Astral)
Yuma, you drew
the perfect card.

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:25.322
If Utopia's attack succeeds,

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:27.825
we shall emerge victorious.

00:14:28.526 --> 00:14:29.959
It's the grand finale,

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.996
we win and Shark's
gonna lose...

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:38.533
(Door)
You would lose that which
is most valuable to you.

00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:41.868
(Yuma thinking)
Lose what's most valuable to me.

00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:44.504
I now know what that is.

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:48.474
(gasping)

00:14:48.474 --> 00:14:51.442
Yuma, is something wrong?

00:14:51.442 --> 00:14:54.378
Why did you stop our attack?

00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:56.480
I had to.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:59.115
Remember what the Door said?

00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:02.185
That I'd lose what's
most valuable to me.

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:04.386
I just figured out
what that is.

00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:07.254
It's not you or my friends

00:15:07.254 --> 00:15:09.089
or the whole world.

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:12.892
What I've lost is myself.

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:13.493
(gasping)

00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:16.528
Thanks to dueling,
I made awesome friends.

00:15:16.762 --> 00:15:18.897
Tori, Bronk, Astral,

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:21.866
and don't think
I forgot about you, Shark.

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:24.100
You big, angry softy you.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.170
But now, look at what
I was about to do.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.806
I was this close to
finishing Shark forever.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.041
That's wrong.

00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:35.510
This isn't how I was
supposed to duel.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.313
I duel to make friends,
not beat them.

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:41.347
I've lost my way.

00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.515
But starting now,

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:45.517
I'm gonna get myself
back on track.

00:15:45.517 --> 00:15:49.420
I'll only do what
I know is right.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.888
So for starters,

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:54.023
I am not gonna defeat Shark.

00:15:54.023 --> 00:15:56.092
Got it?

00:15:56.092 --> 00:15:58.827
I suppose is a tricky dilemma.

00:15:58.827 --> 00:15:59.962
Huh?

00:15:59.962 --> 00:16:00.795
You refuse to win,

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:04.198
but losing will lead
to the end of Astral World.

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:06.533
I know not the answer
to this riddle,

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:10.502
but I have faith that you
will crack this conundrum.

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:12.504
Thanks, Astral.

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:16.007
All right, then, here I go.

00:16:16.007 --> 00:16:17.507
To do what?

00:16:17.507 --> 00:16:19.876
You said you
wouldn't attack me.

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:22.111
What? I don't recall
ever saying that.

00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:23.813
So Utopia gets ready to attack

00:16:23.813 --> 00:16:28.116
by having Sylphid Wing
become its Overlay Unit.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.352
You liar.

00:16:31.352 --> 00:16:34.287
Attack, Utopia.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.195
Attack, Utopia,

00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:47.364
Rising Sun Sylphid Slash.

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.270
I activate Utopia's
special ability.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.271
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:58.972
I negate Utopia's attack.

00:17:04.243 --> 00:17:06.912
Why did Yuma
stop his own attack?

00:17:06.912 --> 00:17:10.515
What's the big idea, Yuma?

00:17:10.515 --> 00:17:12.082
I told you,

00:17:12.082 --> 00:17:14.752
I made a promise that
I wouldn't defeat you.

00:17:14.752 --> 00:17:18.054
But I had no intention
of losing either.

00:17:18.054 --> 00:17:20.422
So you won't win or lose?

00:17:20.422 --> 00:17:21.757
That's impossible.

00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:24.458
Then I guess we just
have to keep dueling

00:17:24.458 --> 00:17:25.926
until I find a way.

00:17:25.926 --> 00:17:28.495
Even if it takes forever,

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:31.464
that's what I'm gonna do.

00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:32.498
(grunting)

00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:33.966
Duel forever?

00:17:33.966 --> 00:17:36.334
You only have 50 life points.

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:38.069
Like I don't know that.

00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:40.270
I never said it would be easy,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.472
but I know that
I'm gonna do it.

00:17:42.472 --> 00:17:45.741
So come on, let's duel.

00:17:47.043 --> 00:17:48.810
(thinking) Oh, Yuma,

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.279
you always were a dreamer.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.247
I active the spell

00:17:53.247 --> 00:17:56.083
Glory of the Seven Emperors.

00:17:56.083 --> 00:17:59.218
All my banished Numbers
become Chaos Xyz

00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:02.020
Barian Hope's Overlay Units.

00:18:07.892 --> 00:18:12.028
This raises my Monster's
attack points to 7,000.

00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:13.729
But Glory of the Seven Emperors

00:18:13.729 --> 00:18:17.333
has another effect that
you might be interested in.

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:20.868
If I take any battle damage,

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:23.737
you take that damage instead.

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:26.472
(gasping)
Then it was a good thing

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.474
Yuma stopped Utopia's attack.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.475
You're right,
because if I didn't,

00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:32.477
we would've lost.

00:18:32.477 --> 00:18:34.778
Let's keep this duel rolling

00:18:34.778 --> 00:18:37.014
because no one has won yet.

00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:40.350
Actually, Yuma,
this duel's over.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.484
You've won.

00:18:42.484 --> 00:18:44.052
Huh? Say what?!

00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:46.288
Glory of the Seven Emperors

00:18:46.288 --> 00:18:48.489
has one final effect.

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:49.890
My life points become equal

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.892
to the change
in your life points.

00:18:52.892 --> 00:18:55.461
Since your life points
didn't change,

00:18:55.461 --> 00:18:58.230
my life points drop to zero.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.735
(gasping)

00:19:04.735 --> 00:19:06.470
Shark!

00:19:15.477 --> 00:19:17.244
(thinking) I lost...

00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:21.147
but I never knew losing
could feel so good.

00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:28.452
(gasping)

00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:31.288
Shark, Shark!

00:19:31.288 --> 00:19:33.456
(groaning)

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:38.460
Shark, are you okay?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.303
I would be if you weren't
screaming my ears off

00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:46.606
like a banshee.

00:19:48.174 --> 00:19:49.308
Even though I lost,

00:19:49.308 --> 00:19:53.312
this is a million times better
than having to duel you forever.

00:19:53.546 --> 00:19:56.582
That's the lamest strategy
I've ever heard.

00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:59.852
But that's what
I like about you.

00:19:59.852 --> 00:20:00.920
Shark...

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.089
It was a privilege to duel you.

00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:05.291
You ain't so bad
yourself, Astral.

00:20:05.524 --> 00:20:09.228
Look after this
twerp for me, will ya?

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:10.997
I guess my long journey

00:20:10.997 --> 00:20:13.733
has finally come
to an end, Yuma.

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:16.002
But yours is only
getting started.

00:20:16.002 --> 00:20:16.802
Any choice you make,

00:20:16.802 --> 00:20:20.306
you won't go wrong as long
as you believe in your friends,

00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:21.307
your family,

00:20:21.307 --> 00:20:25.311
and most importantly,
in yourself.

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:26.912
Remember that.

00:20:26.912 --> 00:20:29.148
I will, Shark.

00:20:30.182 --> 00:20:34.153
You have your whole entire
future ahead of you, Yuma.

00:20:34.153 --> 00:20:37.857
I wish I was around to see it.

00:20:37.857 --> 00:20:39.625
(gasping) No!

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:43.596
Thanks for teaching me
to feel the flow.

00:20:43.596 --> 00:20:46.999
You were great duelist...

00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:49.302
but even better friends.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.942
Shark!

00:20:58.044 --> 00:20:59.912
Good-bye.

00:21:05.284 --> 00:21:07.320
He's gone.

00:21:10.556 --> 00:21:12.692
(crying)

00:21:15.027 --> 00:21:17.096
(bird cawing)

00:21:17.096 --> 00:21:19.565
(screaming)

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.976
