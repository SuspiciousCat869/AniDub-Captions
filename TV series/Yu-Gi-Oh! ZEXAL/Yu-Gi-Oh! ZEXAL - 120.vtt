WEBVTT

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:04.324
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal..."

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:05.559
Huh?

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:06.426
Whoa!

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:07.594
Is that Astral World?

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:11.598
Quinton and Kite did it!
They got me here!

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:12.566
Astral!

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.134
All right!
I found you at last!

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:17.871
Now I'm busting
you out of here.
So let's get going!

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.474
You are not going anywhere.

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:21.141
You're...

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:24.878
I am the Guardian of
Astral World.

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.281
Those that I protect
call me Eliphas.

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:29.616
Let us duel.
Let's duel.

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:35.155
I summon New Order 12
Etheric Maahes!

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:38.892
This guy doesn't quit!

00:00:38.892 --> 00:00:40.594
He keeps powering up
his monsters!

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:44.097
Attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.302
Whoa!

00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:50.937
Barian World?

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:51.338
Yes.

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:54.241
What is important is for
you to fully realize

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.944
everything about
your true self.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:03.617
Vector!
Vengeance will be mine!

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:04.885
This I promise!

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:08.221
I will get payback for my
sister!

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:12.459
Prepare to strike!
Show no mercy!

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.897
Forward!
Victory is ours!

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:20.133
Now go, Etheric Maahes!

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.970
Attack Utopia Ray Victory!

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.507
No!

(thinking)
I'm done for.

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.075
Astral, what--
Kuri, Kuri!

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.612
That's it!

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:39.613
(roaring)

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:45.619
I activate Rainbow Kuriboh's
special ability!

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:46.086
Kuri!

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.122
Rainbow Kuriboh equips on
to your Etheric Maahes,

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:53.326
and Maahes can
no longer attack!

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:01.268
You are only delaying
your defeat.

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:02.168
Huh.

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:03.203
We'll see about that
Eliphas,

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.972
'cause Utopia Ray Victory's
attack points

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:07.173
are all powered up again.

00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:11.945
Relying on your Number for
victory...is quite foolish.

00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:13.213
Since my turn has ended,

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:18.585
Etheric Sebek and Horas return
to being Overlay Units.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:21.821
(thinking)
I gotta figure out a plan to
beat this guy,

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.593
or else Astral and I
are done for.

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:32.599
(crying)

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.613
Here.

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:49.983
You better
eat something.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.420
So, what's your name?

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.591
Iris.

00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.559
This is unreal.

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.528
She looks just like
my sister.

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:02.329
If I didn't now better,

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.599
I'd say she was trying
to send me a sign.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.602
And even though she's
not here with me,

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:11.605
she's always by my side.

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.610
(thinking)
I promise to protect you,
Iris.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.348
I won't let you down
like I did my sister.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.487
Let's go!

00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:30.023
(yelling)

00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:31.157
Aah!

00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:32.592
(horse whinnies)

00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:34.594
Vector!

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.063
Hyah!

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:46.239
Vector's whole army is
down in that valley.

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:48.308
Now is our chance,
Your Highness.

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.944
One final attack
and victory is ours!

00:04:50.944 --> 00:04:52.112
You led us to this point.

00:04:52.112 --> 00:04:54.581
We're ready to finish this
battle once and for all.

00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:58.084
We're at your command,
Your Majesty.

00:04:58.084 --> 00:04:58.985
Here, here.
You are the king

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:01.488
You have our loyalty.
At your service, Sire.

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:02.155
All right.

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:05.158
I'll let you know what actions
to take shortly.

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:07.027
(all)
Yes, Sire!

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.964
We don't have a choice.

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:14.567
We can defeat Vector and his
army if we strike now.

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:17.237
There will be massive
casualties on both sides,

00:05:17.237 --> 00:05:21.875
but that is a sacrifice
we must be willing to make.

00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:25.845
I need time to think.

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:31.951
(thinking)
Even if I win the battle
and defeat Vector,

00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:36.389
my people will suffer.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.958
And it will be all my fault.

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.927
Reginald.

00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:45.532
Rio.

00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:48.034
This is our past, Reginald.

00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:49.836
Our distant past.

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:51.204
Yes, I know.

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:53.540
I know you better
than anyone else,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.008
so even though
you can hide

00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:56.576
your emotions
from the others,

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:58.611
you cannot fool me.

00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.047
I know you are wrestling
with your thoughts.

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:04.184
I know how troubled you are
at this moment.

00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:05.552
Rio, I...

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:07.120
I just don't know
what to do.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.024
You are a good person,
and you want what's best,

00:06:11.024 --> 00:06:15.195
and that makes
some choices painful.

00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:16.896
It must be nice
to be so dumb

00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:19.466
that you don't have
any worries at all,

00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:22.502
like someone I know.

00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:24.604
You mean Yuma?

00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:26.506
But I...

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.609
I have all these other memories
that keep surfacing.

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:34.614
Like Dumon says, we've led
two different lives.

00:06:34.614 --> 00:06:36.082
That's true.

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:39.486
In this life, your
decisions affected many.

00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:43.223
You were the one who decided
the fate of this world.

00:06:43.223 --> 00:06:46.593
And you're deciding that
destiny right now.

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:51.164
Just remember that
I'm always at your side.

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:57.003
There's a way
to end this war

00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:59.139
without taking
heavy casualties,

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.309
and it all rests
on my shoulders

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.949
Vector!

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:10.617
What?

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:12.619
What do you mean Nash
is missing?

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:15.321
Sir, the emperor
and his horse are gone.

00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.590
He must've gone after
Vector alone.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.359
Huh?

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:27.600
Aah!

00:07:29.002 --> 00:07:30.603
Aah!

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.615
Aah!

00:07:45.852 --> 00:07:49.489
This is the labyrinth where
I dueled Abyss!

00:07:57.597 --> 00:07:58.598
Hey, Vector!

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:01.534
We don't need our armies to
battle this out!

00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:05.605
Let's settle this ourselves,
just you and me!

00:08:05.605 --> 00:08:08.341
All right, Nash.

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:10.910
You're on!

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.072
(laughing)

00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:40.273
Ta-da!

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:41.608
Vector.

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:45.845
To think you came
all this way to lose.

00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:47.013
(laughing)

00:08:47.013 --> 00:08:50.383
Since you were the one
who choose where we battle,

00:08:50.383 --> 00:08:54.888
I think I should be the one
to decide how we battle.

00:08:54.888 --> 00:08:55.588
Fine.

00:08:55.588 --> 00:09:00.226
So let's make it
a Shadow Duel!

00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:17.964
This Shadow Duel is
gonna be tons of fun!

00:09:17.964 --> 00:09:19.966
So these stone tablets
function as cards.

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:24.704
I'm gonna make you regret you
challenged me to a duel!

00:09:24.704 --> 00:09:27.574
(laughing)
We'll see.

00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:29.943
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:09:29.943 --> 00:09:31.778
I go first.

00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:34.748
I draw!

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:39.219
First, I summon
Gorgonic Ghoul!

00:09:42.622 --> 00:09:46.860
And next, I think I'll summon
a second Gorgonic Ghoul!

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.896
When there's already a Gorgonic
Ghoul on my field,

00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:54.301
I can bring out another one
for just 300 life points.

00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:59.572
So now, I summon a third
Gorgonic Ghoul!

00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:01.608
I was never one
to follow the rules,

00:10:01.608 --> 00:10:04.311
so I activate
Breaking the Norm!

00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:06.813
I can summon a monster
with the same level

00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.415
onto my field
from your deck!

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:11.518
So instead of just using my
monsters to take you down,

00:10:11.518 --> 00:10:13.920
I'll use one of
yours as well!

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.355
You'll use one of mine!?

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:19.959
Let's see.
How about...

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:21.294
this one.

00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:25.532
I summon Mermaid Shark!

00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:30.970
Why would he just leave?

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.605
I hope he's okay.

00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:35.909
I have to find him!

00:10:37.644 --> 00:10:41.815
I place two stone tablets
facedown and end my turn.

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:42.782
It's my move then!

00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:47.754
And with it, I promise to
crush you and your monsters!

00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:48.788
(laughing)

00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:51.958
Starting...right now!

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.928
I summon Spear Shark!

00:10:57.197 --> 00:11:00.800
And that also lets me summon
Silent Angler!

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.369
And to keep it company,

00:11:02.369 --> 00:11:05.605
I summon a second one
from the deep!

00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:07.574
Spear Shark, time to attack!

00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:10.643
Take out his Gorgonic Ghoul!

00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:11.611
Bad move, my friend!

00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.949
I'm activating the trap
Gorgonic Temptation!

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:18.952
My Gorgon entrances
your little guppy

00:11:18.952 --> 00:11:21.688
so that it'll attack
a different monster,

00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:24.858
like your Mermaid Shark!

00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:28.628
That doesn't change anything!

00:11:28.628 --> 00:11:32.365
My Spear Shark's got
way more attack points!

00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:33.967
(laughing)

00:11:33.967 --> 00:11:37.704
You don't understand how
a Shadow Duel works, do you?

00:11:37.704 --> 00:11:38.471
What?

00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:42.642
I'm so happy to
educate you!

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:49.949
(shouting)

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:51.918
We must save the emperor.

00:11:51.918 --> 00:11:53.553
Attack the enemy!

00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:56.856
(shouting)

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.327
Hold on.
Who gave the orders to attack?

00:12:01.327 --> 00:12:02.195
They shouldn't be fighting.

00:12:02.195 --> 00:12:05.365
Well, they are, and their
destiny rests in your hands.

00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:06.633
This is a Shadow Duel, Nash.

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:08.802
We're the ones who control
what happens.

00:12:08.802 --> 00:12:12.272
Our duel determines
the fate of our armies,

00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:16.943
and you're the one
who made it happen!

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.948
Uhh!

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:25.919
You're more than just
a leader now!

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:29.656
You're the man who unknowingly
started a worldwide war!

00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:30.523
But why?

00:12:30.523 --> 00:12:34.961
Why did you have
to drag others into
our fight, Vector?

00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:35.962
You know why.

00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:38.698
Caring for others is your
greatest weakness.

00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:44.537
(laughing)
And I love seeing you tortured
and tormented because of it!

00:12:44.537 --> 00:12:46.840
(laughing)

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:49.943
Vector!

00:12:49.943 --> 00:12:50.944
Back to our battle.

00:12:50.944 --> 00:12:55.348
So I'll I activate
Disaster Conspiracy!

00:12:55.348 --> 00:12:58.351
All your monsters, including
the ones in your deck

00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:01.187
that are stronger than
Mermaid Shark, are destroyed.

00:13:01.187 --> 00:13:05.525
And since Mermaid Shark only had
a measly 100 attack points,

00:13:05.525 --> 00:13:09.395
all your fish are finished!

00:13:09.963 --> 00:13:11.965
No!

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.874
My monsters, destroyed.

00:13:23.543 --> 00:13:25.311
It's a dead end.

00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:26.679
(shouting)

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:31.651
I place one stone tablet
facedown and end my turn.

00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:33.953
Now I draw.

00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.523
Uhh!

00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:39.959
Let's start off with
Gorgonic Cerberus!

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:44.564
I activate Gorgonic Cerberus'
special ability!

00:13:44.564 --> 00:13:47.934
All my monsters become
Level Three monsters!

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:53.473
I overlay my Level Three
Gorgonic Cerberus and ghoul!

00:13:53.973 --> 00:13:57.944
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:13:57.944 --> 00:14:02.949
and Xyz Summon Gorgonic
Guardian!

00:14:05.952 --> 00:14:07.554
But why stop here?

00:14:07.554 --> 00:14:09.956
Two Gorgonic Guardians
are better than one!

00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:15.962
I Xyz Summon Gorgonic Guardian
number two!

00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:21.534
Here comes a world of pain!

00:14:21.534 --> 00:14:24.270
Attack Nash directly!

00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:27.373
Aah!

00:14:27.373 --> 00:14:29.542
Aah!

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:30.343
(laughing)

00:14:30.343 --> 00:14:33.513
Nash, this is more fun
than I ever imagined!

00:14:33.513 --> 00:14:37.884
Aah!

00:14:37.884 --> 00:14:39.953
Fire!

00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:44.324
Huh?

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:51.258
Aah!

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:58.331
When I destroy you, your army
will be destroyed, too!

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.500
(laughing)

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.471
Don't bet on it, Vector.

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:09.609
I will not fall to you,
and neither will my army.

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.379
(growling)

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.913
My turn!

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.616
I draw!

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:19.119
I activate Gazer Shark's
special ability!

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:24.090
When it's in the graveyard,
I can use it to Xyz Summon.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.628
I overlay two Level Five
Gazer Sharks!

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.631
No way!

00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:33.633
With these new monsters,

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.468
I build the Overlay Network.

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:41.041
I Xyz Summon Number 73,
Abyss Splash!

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:52.052
I activate Abyss Splash's
special ability!

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:58.058
By using one Overlay Unit,
it doubles its attack points!

00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:01.861
Abyss Splash, attack!

00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:03.630
Ugh.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.534
I activate Gorgonic Guardian's
special ability!

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:10.503
By using one Overlay Unit
Abyss Splash

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:13.573
loses all its special abilities
and attack points.

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:16.343
Not if I activate the trap
Overlay Wedge!

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:20.280
Overlay Wedge stops Gorgonic
Guardian's special ability.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.551
And don't think you can
use your other monster's
special abilities,

00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:29.456
because Overlay Wedge
stops them, too!

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:33.426
Oh, no!

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.595
You lose, Vector.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.396
Hyah!

00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:42.168
Abyss Splash, attack Gorgonic
Guardian!

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.608
By beating me,
you think you've won?

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:52.846
You've already lost.
You just don't realize it yet!

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.248
Aah!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.028
It's over.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.030
Uhh.

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:16.169
My men.

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:29.616
Iris.

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.618
Iris!

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:36.623
(crying)
I didn't win anything.

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:40.560
Iris, say something,
anything.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.428
I brought this on.

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:47.167
I'm the one to blame
for all of this...destruction.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.569
Aah!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.152
Huh?

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.089
They are going
to Barian World.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.626
There they will live
as Barians.

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:17.597
Rio. Dumon.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.134
This war. I remember.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:24.137
This was all part of my life
before.

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:26.406
You mean our life.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.874
Now do you see?

00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:31.611
Do you understand why you became
the leader of the Barians?

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.614
All their souls went
to Barian World.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:40.186
And you, as a true leader,
will not abandon your people.

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:44.624
Those souls.
Those innocent souls.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.961
Reginald.

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:52.432
I'm a...Barian.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.635
Who would've guessed it?

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.070
Yuma?

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.605
Astral?

00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:00.139
Kite?

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.574
Who would've guessed

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:06.546
that the leader of their
enemies was...me?

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:13.987
I can't let him win this.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:18.424
There's no way
I can lose this duel!

00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:20.260
All right.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.362
I know the deck
Astral and I built

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.097
is not gonna let me down.

00:19:24.097 --> 00:19:25.465
My turn!

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.866
I draw!

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.602
The energy level
is increasing!

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.870
Increasing?

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.138
But why is that happening?

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:35.608
Something catastrophic could
be occurring on Astral World.

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:38.611
Huh? There must be
a way to stop it.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:39.612
There isn't.

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:43.550
And it's going to destroy
the teleporter.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.618
No! No!

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:49.956
I activate the spell card
Xyz Treasure!

00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:51.324
I draw one card
from my deck

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:55.028
for every Xyz Monster
on the field!

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.100
That means I get to draw
two cards.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.003
I'm gonna get you
out of there, Astral,

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.573
I promise.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.344
Hyah!

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.414
Ha ha!

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:17.483
I activate...
Stealth Strike!

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:20.620
By cutting Utopia Ray Victory's
attack points in half,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.224
it can soar past your monsters
and attack you directly!

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:27.627
That means...

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.629
If our monsters
don't battle each other,

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:32.632
Rank Domination's effect
doesn't activate!

00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.200
That will not happen.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.170
I activate
the trap Rank Wall!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.440
Since my monster's Rank
is higher than yours,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.377
the trap Rank Wall creates
a seal of protection

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:46.379
and ends the battle.

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:49.148
So your attack is futile.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.622
What?

00:20:57.624 --> 00:21:00.627
I thought for sure
that I had him beat.

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:02.629
Time to
figure out Plan B.

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:06.065
At least I have Utopia Ray
Victory's attack points

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:08.001
back at full strength.

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:09.602
Your end is at hand.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.472
Witness the ultimate power
that I possess.

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:16.175
A power so potent that it
has never been revealed

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:18.177
until this very moment.

00:21:18.177 --> 00:21:22.215
Cower at my Rank 13
Xyz Monster!

00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:23.616
A Rank 13?

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:29.856
(thinking)
How can I beat something
I never even knew existed?
