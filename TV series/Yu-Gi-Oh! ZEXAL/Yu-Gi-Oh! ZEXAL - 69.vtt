WEBVTT

00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:02.674
(Yuma)
Last time on Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:06.708
(Dr. Faker)
You've helped me create the
ultimate weapon.

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:08.974
This Sphere Field has
gathered all the Numbers'

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:12.507
powers into one massive
confluence of energy.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.340
Once the cannon fires
this energy,

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:17.174
there will be no
saving Astral World.

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:21.174
The moment we've been waiting
for is almost upon us, my boy!

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.841
Oh no, Hart!

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.107
(Astral)
He is going to use Hart's
power as a trigger

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.974
to fire the
Sphere Field Cannon.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.674
(Dr. Faker)
Once Astral world is destroyed,
Barian's power will be mine!

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.474
And with that this entire
world will kneel before me!

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:39.474
(Kite)
Hart, can you hear me?

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.407
Orbital, get to it.

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.074
I'm on it!

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:48.574
Commencing with full
system overload!

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:52.807
(Dr. Faker)
What's going on?

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.807
Why is Hart's energy
decreasing?

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.274
(Astral)
This may be your moment
to escape.

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.507
We must break
the Zexal bond.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:04.007
(Yuma)
No, we can't break the bond!

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:11.307
We can do this together!

00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.774
This is it!

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:15.674
(Dr. Faker)
If it's a duel you want,
it's a duel you'll get.

00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:17.941
I'll demolish you and be rid
of the whole lot of you

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:19.341
once and for all.

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:22.774
And after that, this world
is mine for the taking.

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:29.307
Yuma.

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.641
You can do this!

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:33.541
I'm sure you can out-duel
Dr. Faker.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:34.574
Get him, Yuma!

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.641
I'm truly looking forward
to battling against you, boy.

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:45.374
I only hope you're prepared to
be completely pulverized!

00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:47.274
That's not gonna happen!

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:49.807
I'll best you
card for card!

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:52.874
And Yuma will be even stronger
'cause I'm dueling with him.

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:55.207
There's no way
I'll miss this fight.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.741
You're facing
three of us!

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:00.507
(all)
We're all ready!

00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:03.074
So am I.

00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:06.407
And I have more power than
you can possibly imagine!

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:16.841
(Yuma)
What's happening to him?

00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:34.974
Now an army of duelists
couldn't defeat me!

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.774
(Yuma)
That's what you think!

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:40.874
Hey guys, gear up.

00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:42.907
Duel Disks go!

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:44.707
Get 'em ready
for action!

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:48.507
(Shark)
You got it, Yuma!

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:49.774
(Kite)Go!

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:51.707
Photon Transformation!

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:57.407
Yeah!

00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:07.907
(Yuma)
Okay, guys, let's go!

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:13.053
Since this is a three
on one duel,

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.053
each of you will
share 4, 000 life points.

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.619
And as your lone opponent,

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:19.186
I will possess triple
that amount

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.453
for a total of
twelve thousand life points!

00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:26.086
Your end begins now.

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:27.386
How appropriate.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.919
I'm going to trash you right
from the start with this card.

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:32.686
I'm sending this
Garbage Ogre

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.219
from my hand
to the graveyard!

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:40.286
That lets me add Garbage
Lord to my hand!

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.186
Good thing I have
all these life points.

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.986
Because by giving up
a thousand of them,

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.119
I can summon to do my
Garbage Lord bidding!

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:50.686
But why summon one when
I can summon three!

00:04:51.753 --> 00:04:53.119
(all)
No way!

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:56.753
My trashy trio will send you and
your friends to the scrap heap!

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:08.153
(Yuma)
Gross, I knew this wouldn't be
a clean duel but gimme a break!

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.586
Relax, there's no
need to panic.

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.753
Huh, who's panicking?

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:13.519
He's not done.

00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:17.453
I overlay my three Level
5 Garbage Lords!

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:21.486
With these three monsters
I build the Overlay Network!

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.786
I'm going to unleash
a force

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.253
greater than
anything you've ever faced!

00:05:29.286 --> 00:05:32.619
It will bring a whirlwind
of agony and destruction!

00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:37.086
But before it appears, it will
need a huge supply of energy!

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:44.319
(Astral)
Oh, no.

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:46.686
It is draining the other
Numbers' power.

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.953
I feel myself
growing weaker.

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:51.919
I Xyz Summon, Number 53!

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.186
Heart-Earth!

00:06:00.953 --> 00:06:03.219
That thing only has
100 attack points!

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:04.653
It's so weak.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.653
It's stronger
than you think.

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.019
Your traps, spells
and special abilities

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:12.619
are useless against
Heart-Earth.

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:17.886
I'm ending my turn, so try
and defeat it if you can!

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:18.986
No problem.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:20.486
I'm taking you on first!

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.686
Be careful Yuma.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.386
There's something fishy
about that monster.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.886
Look, that monster
is a total weakling!

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.219
It'll be a cinch
to beat!

00:06:29.253 --> 00:06:34.319
So you think my Number is
a pushover, Yuma Tsukumo?

00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:38.653
Then you'll be the first duelist
that feels Heart-Earth's wrath!

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:39.819
That's what you think!

00:06:39.853 --> 00:06:41.653
I draw!

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:44.786
I summon Goblindbergh!

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:49.086
Once I've summoned
Goblindbergh,

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:50.953
then I can also
summon another monster

00:06:50.986 --> 00:06:53.753
that's Level 4 or less
from my hand!

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:56.153
That's your cue,
Gagaga Magician!

00:06:56.186 --> 00:06:57.486
Come on out!

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.119
Now I overlay my Goblindbergh
and Gagaga Magician

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:06.819
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:12.053 --> 00:07:16.653
I Xyz Summon: Number 39:
Utopia!

00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:26.919
I was hoping you'd
summon out Utopia.

00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:29.453
Because now I can
put my plan in motion

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:33.186
by activating my Battle
Route trap card!

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.086
When I have
a monster on my field,

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:38.519
any monsters you have in attack
mode are forced to battle

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:42.653
so Utopia will have to fight
Heart-Earth right here and now!

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:44.553
Better keep your
guard up.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:47.553
But his monster
is totally weak.

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:50.586
That's exactly what should
make you suspicious, Yuma.

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:53.219
Why would Dr. Faker want
to force you into a battle

00:07:53.253 --> 00:07:54.953
that he's sure he's
going to lose?

00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:57.186
Oh, yeah, since
he's picking this fight,

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:00.753
that means he's probably got
a trick or two up his sleeve.

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:03.219
Exactly, You have
to be careful.

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:05.653
That just
isn't my style.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.019
Now Utopia!

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:11.053
Topple that
Heart-Earth!

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:15.153
We'll see whose monster
gets toppled, Yuma.

00:08:15.186 --> 00:08:18.786
(Yuma)
Go Rising Sun Slash!

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:19.919
Big mistake!

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:22.619
I activate Heart-Earth's
special ability!

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:24.653
When it's attacked,
this card can equip

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:27.453
itself with one
monster from my graveyard.

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:31.219
I'm equipping Heart-Earth
with Garbage Ogre!

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.819
Heart-Earth now gains
your monster's attack points!

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:42.219
So Utopia, thanks for the 2500
point power-up!

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.886
No way!

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:47.153
Now I understand.

00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:49.953
That Number starts the duel
as a total weakling.

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:51.919
But because of its
special ability,

00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:54.786
it can always have more
attack points than its enemy!

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:58.419
My Heart-Earth is now
stronger than your Utopia!

00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:00.586
Your monsters a goner!

00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:06.586
No, Faker!

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:08.353
That move's a total fail,

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:11.286
'cause I'm using an
Overlay Unit to end this!

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.586
Keep it up, Go!

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:20.786
Right, I'm gonna use my
spell Double or Nothing!

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:22.519
If my monster's
attack is stopped,

00:09:22.553 --> 00:09:24.353
this card lets it
attack again

00:09:24.386 --> 00:09:26.619
only this time with
double the attack points!

00:09:29.153 --> 00:09:32.886
Get ready, Utopia, attack
Heart-Earth again!

00:09:40.253 --> 00:09:41.219
You got him!

00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:43.386
Good work,
Utopia!

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:51.319
Utopia's attack was
insignificant.

00:09:51.353 --> 00:09:54.819
I can undo the
damage all too easily.

00:09:54.853 --> 00:09:58.019
I activate Heart-Earth's
special ability!

00:09:58.053 --> 00:10:01.553
As you will see, by sending the
equipped card to the graveyard,

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.086
Heart-Earth isn't
destroyed!

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.053
But poor ol'
Heart-Earth.

00:10:12.086 --> 00:10:13.753
Since it
lost Garbage Ogre,

00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:16.786
it loses 2500 attack
points.

00:10:16.819 --> 00:10:20.353
Oh wait, that's fine
because now you all take damage

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.086
equal to half of
Utopia's attack points!

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:28.786
No, Yuma!

00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:33.286
(Dr. Faker)
Plus by using
an Overlay Unit,

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:36.053
Heart-Earth can wield another
special ability!

00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:38.886
When you're dealt
damage, I get even stronger

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:42.786
regaining the same amount of
life points that you just lost!

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:53.220
No matter how hard you try,

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:56.220
there's nothing you can
do to stop me!

00:10:56.253 --> 00:10:59.286
I place one card
facedown, and end my turn.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.253
(Shark)
Not exactly an impressive
performance, Yuma.

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:05.253
(Yuma)
Hey...

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:06.820
But that not bad either.

00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:08.853
I can handle him
from here.

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.853
Good luck.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:12.853
I... draw!

00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:14.453
You're full of yourself,
Faker!

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:18.520
But you're about to get
a lesson in humility right now!

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.986
Hey, Shark, you okay?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.353
Don't worry about me.

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:29.886
No, not now!

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.020
I guess that injury I got is
finally catchin' up with me.

00:11:35.053 --> 00:11:36.353
What's wrong?

00:11:36.386 --> 00:11:39.786
Is the thought of dueling
me making you feel weak?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.086
Not at all!

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.653
I'm summoning
Hammer Shark!

00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:47.320
Luckily in this duel,

00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:49.920
I can draw on the power
of my teammates cards!

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:53.320
Now I send Utopia's Overlay
Unit will go to the graveyard!

00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:56.953
What, but I may need
that Unit later.

00:11:56.986 --> 00:11:58.553
Yeah, well, I
need it now!

00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:01.553
Can't you get some
from Kite?

00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:04.786
By sending Utopia's Overlay
Unit to the graveyard,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.553
I'm allowed to
summon XYZ Remora!

00:12:11.486 --> 00:12:14.253
And thanks to the ability
of my XYZ Remora,

00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:16.520
Xyz Summoning
just got easier!

00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:20.953
Okay, now I overlay my Level 4
XYZ Remora and Hammer Shark

00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:23.753
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:27.953
I Xyz Summon
Number 32: Shark Drake!

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:45.286
Yuma, I've decided to take this
next move from your playbook.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.720
Check this out.

00:12:46.753 --> 00:12:50.720
I'm gonna activate the equip
spell Shield Fin from my hand!

00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:53.086
And I'm equipping
it on Utopia!

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.886
Mind if I borrow your
monster for a minute?

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.686
Go, Utopia!

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.386
Smack down that
Heart-Earth!

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.586
Your pathetic
strategy can't work.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.253
I'm too brilliant,
Shark!

00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:11.586
Since it's under attack,
Heart-Earth can now equip itself

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.520
with a monster card from
my graveyard.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.353
And since I've used
this special ability,

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:23.020
Heart-Earth's attack points
once again increase

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.186
by your
monster's attack total

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.220
just as it did before
when I battled Yuma!

00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:29.720
A huge mistake!

00:13:29.753 --> 00:13:32.986
Your lack of attention
is going to cost you!

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.820
Infernal Surge!

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.286
Perfect!

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.053
I was hoping you'd
try that move!

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:43.153
I activate Shield Fin's
effect!

00:13:43.186 --> 00:13:47.153
Now Utopia's attack points drop
to 0 until the end of the turn,

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:49.320
but it can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.886
Why do that?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.420
Shark did it because
he figured out

00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:57.320
Heart-Earth's
weakness, Yuma.

00:14:00.886 --> 00:14:04.053
We're not taking much damage--
only a hundred points.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:06.820
You changed Utopia's
attack points to zero,

00:14:06.853 --> 00:14:10.086
so Heart-Earth wouldn't
gain any attack points!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.386
Exactly!

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.053
Your last battle helped
me to realize

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:15.386
there's a flaw
in Faker's strategy.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.953
Heart-Earth can only use that
special ability once per turn.

00:14:18.986 --> 00:14:21.020
So if it can't gain
attack points anymore,

00:14:21.053 --> 00:14:25.720
it can't use its second special
ability to deal damage to us!

00:14:25.753 --> 00:14:28.353
Shark Drake,
now don't hold back!

00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:30.586
Finish off that Heart-Earth!

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.020
Deep Sea
Destruction!

00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:41.020
I see that the brains
of sharks

00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:43.520
must be even
tinier than I realized.

00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:44.853
You fool!

00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:47.920
It's impossible
to outsmart me!

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:50.953
I activate Heart-Earth's
special ability!

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:53.586
I send the equipped
card to the graveyard,

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.453
so Heart-Earth isn't
destroyed.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.986
And now you're going to
pay for your folly, Shark

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.786
because I'm activating
yet another

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.020
of Heart-Earth's
special abilities!

00:15:05.053 --> 00:15:07.253
By using one Overlay Unit

00:15:07.286 --> 00:15:11.186
you all take damage equal
to half of what I took!

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.153
Your damage dealt to me?

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:15.486
Think of it as
my gift to you.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.586
Hope you enjoy it!

00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:27.365
Shark!

00:15:27.398 --> 00:15:28.998
No matter what
tactic we try,

00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:31.398
he's got a way to turn it
against us.

00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:38.064
Looks like I'm
finished for now.

00:15:38.097 --> 00:15:40.131
It's Kite's turn.

00:15:40.164 --> 00:15:42.364
All right,
Faker...

00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:44.664
Ha, it's on.

00:15:44.697 --> 00:15:46.831
I'll win this
to save Hart!

00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:49.331
The fact is, you
won't save anyone.

00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:53.231
When this is over,
you'll have lost everything.

00:15:53.264 --> 00:15:55.231
I hate to spoil your plans, you
maniac but that won't happen.

00:15:55.264 --> 00:15:59.597
I summon
Photon Crusher!

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:06.564
Then I'll summon
Photon Slasher!

00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:08.331
True, I can't
summon it normally

00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:12.497
but since there's an Xyz monster
on your field, all that changes.

00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:16.531
I now have the power to summon
it from my hand in defense mode.

00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:20.697
Now I'll tribute
both Photon monsters.

00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:24.997
Here comes the monster more
savage than a supernova!

00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:28.931
With the cataclysmic force of
ten black holes put together!

00:16:28.964 --> 00:16:31.497
A cosmic scourge that
vaporizes anything in its

00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:35.697
path Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.931
Whoa!

00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:42.831
Now those three totally
have the upper hand.

00:16:42.864 --> 00:16:47.797
Utopia, Shark
Drake and Galaxy-Eyes.

00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:50.397
They assembled a monster
dream team!

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.797
All right, Kite my son,

00:16:56.831 --> 00:17:00.964
go ahead and try to vanquish me,
if you have the strength!

00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:08.164
What's wrong, Kite?

00:17:08.197 --> 00:17:09.564
I'll be all right.

00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:11.097
It's no
big deal.

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:13.764
But you can't
even stand up.

00:17:13.797 --> 00:17:15.297
Your work as
a Number Hunter

00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:17.797
has drained almost all
of your energy.

00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:20.564
Very soon you'll have
no strength left at all!

00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:22.031
Leave Kite alone!

00:17:22.064 --> 00:17:25.197
You're the one responsible for
what's happening to his body!

00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:26.497
What kind of
sick person are you

00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:28.497
to treat your own
son this way?

00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:29.931
This has gone
far enough!

00:17:29.964 --> 00:17:31.264
You're so
hungry for power

00:17:31.297 --> 00:17:34.431
that you'll manipulate anyone
to further your insane plans.

00:17:34.464 --> 00:17:37.164
I won't let you
cause any more harm!

00:17:37.197 --> 00:17:40.764
And so, how do you
plan on stopping me?

00:17:40.797 --> 00:17:42.697
(Kite)
That's the big question.

00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:45.564
If I use Shield Fin's effect
I can damage him

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.164
but then he can use
Heart-Earth's ability

00:17:47.197 --> 00:17:49.564
to bounce that damage
right back to me.

00:17:49.597 --> 00:17:51.131
So then what should I do?

00:17:51.164 --> 00:17:53.297
Maybe there is no way
to stop him.

00:17:53.331 --> 00:17:54.964
No... wait.

00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:57.864
Yuma, I need
to borrow Utopia!

00:17:57.897 --> 00:17:59.231
Sure!

00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:04.397
Now, Utopia, attack Heart-Earth
with all your might!

00:18:05.464 --> 00:18:07.264
It's pointless!

00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:08.731
When you attack
Heart-Earth

00:18:08.764 --> 00:18:12.264
I can equip a monster card
from my graveyard to it.

00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:14.464
And that's exactly
what I'm planning to do

00:18:14.497 --> 00:18:20.197
using one my most charming
cards-- Garbage Ogre!

00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:24.297
That means Heart-Earth
now has 2600 attack points.

00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:27.764
Scorch him with
Infernal Surge!

00:18:27.797 --> 00:18:29.331
(Kite)
Not so fast!

00:18:29.364 --> 00:18:31.964
I'm activating Shield
Fin's effect!

00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:36.964
By lowering Utopia's
attack points to 0,

00:18:36.997 --> 00:18:40.164
it's not
destroyed in battle.

00:18:40.197 --> 00:18:42.364
Get ready Shark Drake,
you're going to strike

00:18:42.397 --> 00:18:44.097
at Heart-Earth
on my signal.

00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:46.331
Another futile attack!

00:18:46.364 --> 00:18:47.797
(Kite)
This is it, Shark Drake!

00:18:47.831 --> 00:18:50.431
Deep Sea Destruction!

00:18:54.664 --> 00:18:57.031
I activate Heart-Earth's
special ability!

00:18:57.064 --> 00:18:59.997
I'll send Garbage Ogre
back to the graveyard,

00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:02.197
and Heart-Earth
isn't destroyed.

00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:05.997
And after that, I'll activate
another ability!

00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:07.964
By giving up
an Overlay Unit,

00:19:07.997 --> 00:19:12.564
half the 2700 points of damage
I took are now yours!

00:19:12.597 --> 00:19:16.931
So please, enjoy
them with my compliments!

00:19:16.964 --> 00:19:19.131
No one can defeat me!

00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:21.897
Astral!

00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:24.364
We don't have enough
life points left!

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:25.564
True.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:27.264
If we take
damage then...

00:19:28.931 --> 00:19:32.564
Bow down, Kite,
before my superior power!

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:34.097
I don't bow to anybody!

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.797
I play the spell
Photon Prevent!

00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:39.564
I knew you'd try to finish me
off with a special ability,

00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:42.197
but since I have
a Photon monster on my field,

00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:44.164
this spell stops all
the damage.

00:19:44.197 --> 00:19:45.864
You're still standing!?

00:19:45.897 --> 00:19:47.664
Yes, this is perfect.

00:19:47.697 --> 00:19:50.297
Kite can now attack
with Galaxy-Eyes!

00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:52.631
Galaxy-Eyes's 3000
attack points

00:19:52.664 --> 00:19:54.897
are enough to
finish this battle!

00:19:56.497 --> 00:19:59.797
It's fitting our duel should
end this way, Faker.

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:02.631
I always obeyed your
orders without question.

00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.864
Thanks to you,
I became a Number Hunter

00:20:04.897 --> 00:20:07.097
who preyed on innocent
duelists.

00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:11.664
Because I believed if I did,
you could save Hart.

00:20:11.697 --> 00:20:15.031
But now, I know
it was all a lie.

00:20:15.064 --> 00:20:17.964
I owe it to Hart and the
duelists I harmed

00:20:17.997 --> 00:20:20.864
to make sure you finally pay
for all the pain you've caused.

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:22.597
You didn't show
them any pity

00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:24.531
and I won't have
any for you now!

00:20:24.564 --> 00:20:25.897
It's time!

00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:29.397
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon,
attack!

00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:32.797
Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.197
No way.

00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:43.231
Is it over?

00:20:43.264 --> 00:20:45.231
Have they actually
won the duel?

00:20:45.264 --> 00:20:47.897
(Yuma)
I can't believe it, we did it!

00:20:47.931 --> 00:20:50.397
Faker got beat
mega-big-time!

00:20:50.431 --> 00:20:54.564
We stuck it to him like a
chewed-up wad of bubblegum!

00:20:54.597 --> 00:20:55.764
It can't be!

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.364
But it is.
Huh?

00:20:57.397 --> 00:20:59.831
Wait, you gotta
be kidding.

00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:09.231
It looks like
Faker survived...

00:21:09.264 --> 00:21:12.131
only now he's got
a new friend!

00:21:12.164 --> 00:21:15.664
(Faker maniacal laugh)
