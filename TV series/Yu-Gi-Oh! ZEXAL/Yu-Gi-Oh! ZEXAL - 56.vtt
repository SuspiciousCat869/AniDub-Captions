WEBVTT

00:00:00.588 --> 00:00:03.521
(Yuma)
Last time on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:05.121
(Quinton)
At last...

00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:09.288
I knew you and I would face each
other in battle someday, Kite.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.354
You're gonna regret
what you did to Hart...

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.021
I'll make sure of that.

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:15.821
(Both)
Now let's duel!

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.555
Here goes... I summon
Photon Delta Wing!

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:30.421
I Xyz Summon Number 9:
Dyson Sphere

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.388
Where is
your Number, Quinton?

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.755
You will discover
that soon enough.

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:36.921
(Kite)
I know that Number is
out there somewhere,

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:40.421
but even if I can't see it, I
have to try and take it down!

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:44.055
Photon Delta Wing
attack Dyson Sphere!

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:50.021
It failed?

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:51.421
Of course it did.

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:54.422
To understand why,
take a look at my Number!

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.555
♪

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:19.155
No way!

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.322
A monster bigger
than the sun?

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:29.355
That thing...
it's so huge.

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:31.855
How could any
monster destroy it?

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:34.188
It seems impossible!

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:36.555
That's because
it is impossible.

00:01:36.588 --> 00:01:39.722
No one has ever defeated
Dyson Sphere in battle

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:41.788
and no one ever will!

Whoa-- That's no monster,
it's a mega-monster!

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:52.288
(Quinton)
My Dyson Sphere is
more magnificent

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:54.355
than all your
Monsters combined!

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:57.522
And it's practically
invincible!

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.555
Your pitiful attacks
can't damage it, Kite.

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:01.655
That can't be!

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:04.522
There must be a way
to destroy it.

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:07.788
You're wrong. As long as it
has its Overlay Units,

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:13.022
Dyson Sphere will be
shielded from any attack.

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:16.155
So that's why my attack
wasn't successful before.

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:18.055
But now I know
its weakness...

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:21.355
If you say so, Kite.

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:24.388
I know every move you'll make
before you even do.

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:25.955
You can't surprise me.

00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:27.388
After all...

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:29.555
I taught you
everything you know.

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:36.022
He was Kite's dueling
instructor?

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:37.655
It's true.

00:03:37.688 --> 00:03:40.888
Vetrix... I mean,
my father... vanished

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:42.722
and my family was
torn apart.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.788
Don't let them
take us!

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:46.188
My kid brothers were
taken away from me...

00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:48.955
It was hard to watch them go,
but I stayed behind

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:50.388
with Dr. Faker

00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:54.855
to try and solve the mystery
of my father's disappearance.

00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:57.388
That's when I met
Dr. Faker's sons...

00:03:57.422 --> 00:03:58.955
Kite and Hart.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:02.488
I suppose when I saw them they
reminded me of my own brothers.

00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:05.122
I liked them right away and
my brotherly instincts

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:06.988
started taking over...

00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:10.622
That's why I began
teaching Kite how to duel.

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:14.022
More than anything, he wanted to
protect his younger brother.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.655
But he knew he would
have to become much stronger.

00:04:17.688 --> 00:04:20.022
We had many practice duels
as I tried to teach him

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:21.888
everything I could.

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:27.522
But we're no longer master and
pupil and this duel is for real.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:30.455
I won't let you stand
in my way, Kite.

00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:33.055
Your dueling days
will soon be over!

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:41.019
I'm ending my turn!

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:43.019
Throw your worst
at me, Quinton!

00:04:43.052 --> 00:04:45.252
With pleasure, I draw!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.085
You're so predictable.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.385
It's almost like
I can read your mind.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.852
You've noticed that Dyson Sphere
has 2,800 attack points.

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:56.052
But your
Galaxy-Eyes has 3,000.

00:04:56.085 --> 00:05:00.452
So you feel confident that
I can't attack.

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:02.885
But there's one fact
you didn't count on.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.619
Dyson Sphere
has another ability...

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:08.219
...and I'm going to activate
it right now!

00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:11.519
By using one
Overlay Unit, my Dyson Sphere

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:13.319
can attack you directly!

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.452
No way!

00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:20.185
This move will leave Quinton
with a serious advantage.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.919
Kite won't have many
life points left!

00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:24.019
His systems are
crashing!

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.119
(Quinton)
Go Brilliant
Bombardment!

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:31.785
I activate a trap!

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.885
Lumenize!

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.419
This card not only stops
your attack, but my Galaxy-Eyes

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:39.952
gets a power-up equal to Dyson
Sphere's attack points!

00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:50.119
It appears that Kite now
has the advantage over Quinton!

00:05:50.152 --> 00:05:51.852
Impressive.

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:54.419
But totally expected.

00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:57.752
I activate my own trap...
Space Gate!

00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:03.052
Space Gate destroys your trap,
so say good-bye to Lumenize!

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:05.419
That means your
Galaxy-Eyes doesn't power up

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:08.785
and Dyson Sphere still gets
to attack you directly!

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.919
This one's for my family!

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:13.252
Dr. Faker's
treachery tore us apart!

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:17.119
Defeating you will be just
the start of our revenge!

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:23.452
Master Kite!

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:25.019
I can't
believe it!

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.819
He's making Kite look
like an amateur!

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.719
It is
quite remarkable.

00:06:34.752 --> 00:06:37.619
I can detect no weakness
in Quinton's play.

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:39.285
What's the point in
continuing?

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.585
It's hopeless.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:44.085
You only have
200 life points left, Kite.

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:45.852
Why not admit
the truth?

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:49.219
You'll never
out-duel me!

00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:50.219
(Yuma)
C'mon, Kite!

00:06:50.252 --> 00:06:52.185
You can't quit
now!

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.452
Think about your
little brother!

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:56.952
What will happen
to Hart if you lose?

00:06:56.985 --> 00:06:57.885
My brother...

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.119
Stand up!

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:04.519
Be quiet!

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.952
Let me do the dueling
and butt out!

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:10.885
Yeah, stop with the annoying
comments, you got that?

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:11.985
Back off, 'bot!

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.251
You can be just
as annoying as Yuma!

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:16.518
Thanks a lot.

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.218
Don't be
naiïve, Yuma.

00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:21.718
You should be on my side,
not on Kite's.

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:23.851
Kite's the eldest
son of Dr. Faker...

00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.585
the man who betrayed
your father.

00:07:25.618 --> 00:07:27.351
He's also a Number Hunter,

00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:29.251
so you can be sure he'll
come after your cards

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.851
if he hasn't already.

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:33.885
Can't you see that
he's our mutual enemy?

00:07:33.918 --> 00:07:35.385
It's obvious!

00:07:35.418 --> 00:07:36.351
No.

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:38.151
Kite and I dueled.

00:07:38.185 --> 00:07:40.018
And that means we'll
always be friends.

00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:42.718
Sure, maybe he doesn't
realize he's my friend yet,

00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:45.218
but he will someday.

00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:48.718
And because he is a friend,
I'll always be on his side!

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:50.718
Very touching, Yuma.

00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.385
Your father spoke about
friendship that way, too.

00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:56.585
Of course, that was before Faker
double-crossed him

00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:58.351
and my father!

00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:00.085
They trusted him, Yuma!

00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:03.585
And they both paid
the price.

00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:06.251
Maybe you can forget that and
be friends with Faker's son...

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.585
but I can't.

00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:13.585
Not since I learned the truth
and made up my mind to leave!

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.718
Hey... Wait up!

00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:18.718
What's wrong--
Why are you leaving?

00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.785
Talk to me!

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:35.585
Quinton...

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.351
The past doesn't matter!

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:43.885
All I care about is winning this
duel and taking your Number!

00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:45.151
You won't.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:47.751
My rage makes me want this
win more than you do.

00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:48.918
Enough talk!

00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:50.318
Let's get back
to dueling!

00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:53.151
I draw!

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.151
This is it...

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:56.818
Time to beat the
unbeatable!

00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.051
I play the spell
card Overlay Break!

00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:03.251
This card not only gets rid of
Dyson Sphere's Overlay Units,

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:05.318
but now any monster can
destroy it in battle

00:09:05.351 --> 00:09:07.351
even if it's not a Number!

00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:08.785
Impressive maneuver.

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:20.885
And now I can blast
Dyson Sphere into space debris!

00:09:20.918 --> 00:09:24.718
Destroy it, Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.651
Photon Stream
of Destruction!

00:09:26.685 --> 00:09:29.451
Yet another move
I totally expected.

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.418
I activate another one of Dyson
Sphere's special abilities!

00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:34.085
Say what?

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:37.318
If Dyson Sphere has no Overlay
Units when it's attacked,

00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:41.785
then it can retrieve the units
it needs from the graveyard.

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:43.785
Now that it has
its Overlay Units back,

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:46.951
I activate Dyson Sphere's
first ability.

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:50.451
Which means that your dragon's
paltry attack will be repelled!

00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:56.385
I did warn you.

00:09:56.418 --> 00:09:58.718
No one can destroy
Dyson Sphere.

00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:01.451
Your defeat is unavoidable.

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.951
Quinton's got Kite's back
against the wall.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:07.451
One more attack
and it's over.

00:10:12.944 --> 00:10:14.578
(Kite)
That Number seems
indestructible.

00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.444
I've gotta think...

00:10:16.478 --> 00:10:19.644
I place one card
facedown.

00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:21.544
Your turn.

00:10:21.578 --> 00:10:22.811
It's time!

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.378
I draw!

00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:25.911
Whoa... here
it comes!

00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:28.578
A direct attack!

00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.811
Now I'll activate...
the spell Gravity Blaster!

00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:33.378
A spell?

00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:37.478
This equip spell raises Dyson
Sphere's attack points by 400!

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:39.644
And it gets worse...
much worse!

00:10:39.678 --> 00:10:41.778
When Dyson Sphere
battles your monster,

00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:44.978
my spell negates your monster's
special abilities.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.544
Why doesn't Quinton
attack him directly?

00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:50.911
That would end
the duel right now.

00:10:50.944 --> 00:10:53.911
You understand what I'm doing,
don't you, Kite?

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.978
Defeating you
isn't enough.

00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:58.644
I want the satisfaction of
destroying the card

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:01.678
you treasure
most... Galaxy-Eyes!

00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:06.111
Take aim, Dyson Sphere!

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:08.378
Attack!

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.044
I activate a trap!

00:11:14.078 --> 00:11:15.911
Mirror shade!

00:11:15.944 --> 00:11:17.978
By giving up half
my life points,

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.944
I don't take any
damage from your attack!

00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:26.144
Flaming floppies!

00:11:31.578 --> 00:11:32.911
You may not realize it,

00:11:32.944 --> 00:11:35.144
but I'm really doing you
a favor, Kite.

00:11:35.178 --> 00:11:38.878
You've been forced to carry
many burdens these past years.

00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:40.711
Now you'll be free
from them all.

00:11:40.744 --> 00:11:41.978
I envy you.

00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:44.711
You won't have
to hunt Numbers anymore

00:11:44.744 --> 00:11:49.578
or take care of your little
brother, Hart.

00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:53.978
No... You're wrong
about Hart!

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:56.978
I never thought of him
as a burden and I never will!

00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.411
My brother Hart means
everything to me!

00:11:59.444 --> 00:12:02.211
He's the reason
I keep fighting on!

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:03.878
Hart needs me and I
need him.

00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:06.578
So I'm never
gonna give up!

00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.478
Now let's go!

00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:12.111
If you want to extend
this farce, be my guest.

00:12:12.144 --> 00:12:13.378
My turn!

00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:15.611
I draw!

00:12:15.644 --> 00:12:17.078
(Kite)
I can't believe it!

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.111
Out of all the cards
in my deck...

00:12:19.144 --> 00:12:21.444
...I drew the one
that gives me a chance!

00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:23.311
Hart, there's still hope!

00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:29.111
I was meant to
draw this card.

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:32.011
I activate the spell card
Message In A Bottle!

00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:35.244
What?

00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:40.978
How'd Kite ever get
his hands on that card?

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.044
Even though you trained me,
there are some things

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:45.778
you don't know about
my dueling or my deck!

00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:47.878
I never told you
about this card.

00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:49.611
You see it's very special.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:53.944
It's the only card my
father ever gave me!

00:12:53.978 --> 00:12:55.878
It came from
his father...

00:12:55.911 --> 00:12:58.244
Dr. Faker!

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.478
I never used
this card 'til now...

00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:02.478
so you couldn't
know about it.

00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.311
How could you include your
father's card in your deck?

00:13:05.344 --> 00:13:07.978
You know all the terrible
things he's done!

00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:09.611
(Yuma)
You shouldn't
judge Kite!

00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:12.044
He's only been trying to
help his brother...

00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:14.944
the same way you've been
trying to help your own family!

00:13:14.978 --> 00:13:16.811
You've both done things
I don't like...

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:18.744
but I respect one thing.

00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:20.444
Kite has hope for
his family...

00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:24.244
the same
as you do!

00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:26.378
Hope for
his family...

00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:27.378
Don't you see
that Kite--

00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.811
Enough!

00:13:29.844 --> 00:13:31.544
This feud is none of
your business...

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:34.578
so stay out of it, Yuma.

00:13:34.611 --> 00:13:37.111
Now with the power of
Message In A Bottle,

00:13:37.144 --> 00:13:39.378
I can summon three
monsters from my graveyard

00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:41.878
as long as they each have
a different Level.

00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:45.544
First I'm gonna bring back
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:13:45.578 --> 00:13:48.278
Welcome back Galaxy-Eyes!

00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:50.578
And next, I'm bringing
back Photon Thrasher

00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:52.611
and Photon Pirate!

00:13:52.644 --> 00:13:54.644
When I summon monsters
using this spell,

00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:56.444
they have zero attack points.

00:13:56.478 --> 00:13:57.778
So that's
your big play?

00:13:57.811 --> 00:13:59.444
I'm not impressed.

00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:01.311
They're powerless and you
can't Overlay them

00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:02.811
because they're
different Levels.

00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:04.911
I haven't finished yet.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.144
There's more?

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:09.144
Yeah, I'm activating
another spell card!

00:14:09.178 --> 00:14:10.611
It's Upshift!

00:14:10.644 --> 00:14:13.211
This card raises the Levels of
my monsters on my field

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:16.411
so that they all equal
the highest Level monster!

00:14:16.444 --> 00:14:19.244
So now all my monsters
increase their Level to 8!

00:14:21.811 --> 00:14:22.778
Oh, no.

00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:24.144
Oh, yes!

00:14:24.178 --> 00:14:26.444
Now I'll overlay my
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon,

00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:28.778
Photon Thrasher, and
Photon Pirate

00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.578
in order
to Xyz Summon!

00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.411
Your fate is sealed!

00:14:41.444 --> 00:14:42.778
There's no escape...

00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:46.611
...from Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:02.711
As you know... Since my Xyz
Summon succeeded,

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:04.611
this space
field's effect activates

00:15:04.644 --> 00:15:06.611
allowing me to
draw one card.

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:11.944
Perfect!

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:15.944
Neo Galaxy-Eyes' special
ability activates!

00:15:15.978 --> 00:15:18.111
Photon Howling!

00:15:21.478 --> 00:15:24.978
Once I Xyz Summon Neo
Galaxy-Eyes, all other monsters

00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:27.444
immediately lose their
special abilities!

00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:30.644
That's bad news
for your Dyson Sphere!

00:15:33.444 --> 00:15:35.578
It's losing power...

00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:44.644
I'm also activating the spell
card Big Bang Panic!

00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:48.411
It transforms your spell
card into an Overlay Unit!

00:15:54.811 --> 00:15:56.411
Oh, by the way...
did I mention

00:15:56.444 --> 00:16:00.144
that my monster gains 800 attack
points for each Overlay Unit?

00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:07.944
Now Neo Galaxy-Eyes
uses one of its Overlay Units

00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:10.978
to activate its special
ability.

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:16.031
...which lets it absorb all of
Dyson Sphere's Overlay Units!

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:21.644
And that seals it because Neo
Galaxy-Eyes gains 500 points

00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:23.778
for each absorbed unit!

00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:26.411
I can't believe it gained
so much power!

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.811
That's right...
more than you know!

00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:31.144
My Dragon can now attack once
for each Overlay Unit

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:35.044
it absorbed!

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:38.744
Go, Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon...

00:16:38.778 --> 00:16:42.144
Attack with Ultimate
Photon Stream of Destruction!

00:16:51.013 --> 00:16:54.079
Go, Neo Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon...

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:58.079
Attack with Ultimate
Photon Stream of Destruction!

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:28.313
(screaming)

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:43.013
This is for you, Kite.

00:17:46.246 --> 00:17:48.679
Thank you, Father!

00:17:56.646 --> 00:17:57.879
(Quinton)
I can see now
that there are things

00:17:57.913 --> 00:18:00.479
more powerful than revenge.

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:03.646
Deep down, I always knew
that was true...

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:06.446
but today you helped
me remember it, Kite.

00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:11.313
Quinton... I mean...
Christopher Arclight...

00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:14.946
It's been a long time since
anybody called me by that name.

00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:17.879
I don't understand why
you ever changed it.

00:18:17.913 --> 00:18:22.546
Like our father, we decided
to give up our true names.

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:23.579
At first...

00:18:23.613 --> 00:18:26.446
I was hoping that
I could save my father.

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:30.046
But Byron Arclight really
had become someone else.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:31.713
Vetrix was
obsessed with his desire

00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:34.246
to get revenge against
Dr. Faker.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:37.779
I got caught up in
his plans for vengeance.

00:18:37.813 --> 00:18:41.546
I felt... it was my duty
as his son.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.079
It isn't.

00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:48.146
Once I save Hart, I'm
going to confront my father.

00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:50.779
And not only that, I'll do
what you couldn't do!

00:18:50.813 --> 00:18:54.979
I'll stop Vetrix' quest for
revenge just like you wanted!

00:18:55.013 --> 00:18:57.213
You've grown strong, Kite.

00:18:57.246 --> 00:19:00.446
I am proud to have been
your teacher.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.779
It was an honor.

00:19:02.813 --> 00:19:06.413
The bond we forged can
never be broken....

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:09.813
You and Hart will always
be like little brothers to me.

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:12.346
Goodbye, Kite.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.146
Goodbye, Chris.

00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:23.446
Hey, Kite...

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:24.979
Yes, Yuma?

00:19:25.013 --> 00:19:26.646
I'll look for you in
the next round.

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:30.313
We're both definitely
gonna make it there!

00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:31.413
Let's go.

00:19:31.446 --> 00:19:32.446
Right now, Orbital!

00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:33.813
Right!

00:19:33.846 --> 00:19:35.713
Er, mind if we drop by a
mechanic's on the way home?

00:19:35.746 --> 00:19:39.546
I'm way past due for
my annual check-up.

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:42.746
Guess I should interpret
that surly glare as a "no."

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:44.479
I'll have to maintain
myself then.

00:19:44.513 --> 00:19:47.413
Let's just hope the robo-union
doesn't catch wind of this!

00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:49.346
Okay, all systems go!

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:13.246
(Quinton)
I'm so tired...

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.946
I need rest...

00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:22.146
Vetrix and Dr. Faker
both have to be stopped.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.813
Perhaps that is my true
purpose here.

00:20:24.846 --> 00:20:27.646
We know that your
father is in Astral World.

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:32.479
What if... he sent me here in
order to intervene somehow?

00:20:32.513 --> 00:20:34.379
Yeah, that's it!

00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:38.879
Dad wanted us to team up
to stop Dr. Faker and Vetrix!

00:20:38.913 --> 00:20:40.313
You think you can do it?

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:41.579
Yeah!

00:20:41.613 --> 00:20:43.746
I promise... we'll stand
up to them..

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:46.313
and end their
mischief for good!

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:49.123
My father is counting
on us!
