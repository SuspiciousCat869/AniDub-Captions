00:00:00.576 --> 00:00:01.540
(Yuma) <i>Last time</i>

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.542
<i>on "Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL"...</i>

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:08.466
Girag ambushed me.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.068
But why would he?

00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:12.270
I'm the leader of the Barians.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.338
Something's going on!

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.074
<i>So you think you'll defeat us</i>

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:18.443
<i>and steal all of our powers?</i>

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:19.377
Marin? Dumon?

00:00:19.377 --> 00:00:21.479
<i>You have lostyour mind, Vector.</i>

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.516
Don Thousand and I have
come to an agreement!

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:26.651
(sinister laughter)

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:30.789
The time has finally come
for you to serve your purpose:

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.327
I will consume your energies
to feed my power!

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.295
(all) Let's duel!

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:39.264
It's just like old times.

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:40.599
I destroyed you years ago,

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:44.502
and now I have the pleasure
of destroying you again!

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.103
Again?

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:48.807
I'm the one who erased
you and Nash from existence!

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:52.243
I'm taking all the pain
and suffering you've caused

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:54.646
and sending it
rocketing back to you!

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:57.449
This is good-bye, Vector.

00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:02.082
I'm going to wipe out
all your life points

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:03.150
in a single turn!

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.985
Go ahead, try it!

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:07.321
But if I've got
even one point left,

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.124
you take the same amount
of damage I do,

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.159
and you'll be through!

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.428
Which means this will be
the second time

00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:17.431
you have faced
annihilation at my hands!

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.199
I would not count on that.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.335
You will pay for your betrayal.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.969
Mark my words, Vector!

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:23.737
Dumon...

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.039
You couldn't be more right.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.076
I know how to eliminate
all his life points!

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:32.779
But it will come
at a great cost.

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.147
What do you mean?

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:38.352
I activate the spell card
Distortion Crystal!

00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:39.419
Now it's crystal clear

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.321
your chances of winning
have dropped,

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:44.291
because when your monster's
attack points change,

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.759
this card doubles that amount!

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.130
Next, I activate
the spell Zero Blade...

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.434
It lowers a monster's attack
points by a thousand!

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:56.795
A thousand points?!

00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:00.532
Actually, your monster
loses 2,000 points!

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:04.035
Distortion Crystal doubles
Zero Blade's effect!

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:04.970
I know it's getting chilly,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.206
but is the cold already
putting your brain on ice?

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.007
Clever girl...

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.077
More than you think,
because I activate

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:13.912
Ragnafinity's special ability!

00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:16.214
By using one
Chaos Overlay Unit,

00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:18.721
you take damage equal to
the amount of attack points

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:19.782
your monster lost!

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.207
What?!

00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:24.878
Boost Blade Blitz!

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:27.347
Aah...!

00:03:27.347 --> 00:03:30.350
(grunting)

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.621
I admit,
for a fraction of a second

00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:35.922
I was nearly worried...

00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:39.959
But I have more than enough
life points left

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.028
to survive your next attack!

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:43.963
Don't be so sure.

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:44.831
(growling)

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:49.069
Zero Blade lets
Ragnafinity attack twice!

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.856
Fitting, since I owe you
two times the payback!

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:54.004
No!

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.242
You tried to destroy me
and my brother Nash,

00:03:57.242 --> 00:04:00.279
so it's perfect that this
punishment comes as a pair!

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:06.518
Ragnafinity, attack
Manipulator of Souls!

00:04:09.254 --> 00:04:13.025
Yah...!

00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:17.296
Even if Manipulator of Souls
can't be destroyed

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:19.698
when it's equipped
with a Number...

00:04:19.698 --> 00:04:20.732
you still take damage.

00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:24.803
That's why this next attack
means you're finished!

00:04:24.803 --> 00:04:27.306
Goodbye forever, Vector!

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:29.274
(groaning)

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.978
Ragnafinity... attack!

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:40.152
Aah...!

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:43.288
I activate Damage Pot!

00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:48.293
I'm afraid this trap will be
canceling your victory.

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:55.233
It sucked up all the damage!

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:56.301
Very good, Dumon!

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:58.303
But also very bad, for you.

00:04:58.303 --> 00:05:01.606
You failed to get rid of
all my life points, Marin!

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:06.878
So Don Thousand's Throne
fixes me up as good as new!

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:15.721
(groaning)

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.690
(laughing)

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.295
That's just the pick-me-up
I need to put you down.

00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:26.732
It's time I end this farce!

00:05:26.732 --> 00:05:29.768
When I activate Manipulator
of Souls's special ability,

00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:31.803
not only will it gain
attack points

00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:36.241
but you'll lose the same number
of life points I regained!

00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:38.710
I lost 3300 points.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.545
And even you
don't need a calculator

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:43.749
to figure out
that's more than 500!

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.283
(growling)

00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:46.618
(laughing)

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:50.288
Manipulator of Souls,
finish her!

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:52.190
<i>Vector, stop!</i>

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.292
<i>Think, you senseless fool!</i>

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.595
<i>Ragnafinity'sspecial ability</i>

00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.231
<i>will deal us damage, too!</i>

00:05:59.231 --> 00:06:00.265
I know that.

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:02.534
But I have 4,000
life points now.

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.303
I can afford to lose
3300 points.

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:09.307
<i>Is that so, or has your</i>
feeblemind forgotten about

00:06:09.307 --> 00:06:11.877
<i>Marin's spellDistortion Crystal?</i>

00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:13.145
Oh, you're right!

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:18.884
It'll double the damage I take
from 3300 to 6600 points!

00:06:18.884 --> 00:06:20.152
I cannot do that!

00:06:20.152 --> 00:06:25.157
Come on, Vector,
let's see what you've got!

00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:25.991
(growling)

00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:29.561
You're not doubting your own
brilliance, are you?

00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:30.996
Do you need a moment?

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:32.097
What about you?

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:34.716
If I use Manipulator of Souls's
special ability,

00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:35.950
you are no more!

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.486
Don't you think I know that?

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:39.454
Huh?!

00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:40.254
Just as I thought!

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:41.756
You are willing
to sacrifice yourself.

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:44.826
If that's what it takes
to get rid of Vector, yes!

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:49.464
Huh? In that case, I won't use
the special ability!

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:52.467
I always knew
you were a coward.

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:57.205
How dare you speak to me
that way, you worthless insect?

00:06:57.205 --> 00:07:02.477
You don't command
any respect, unlike Nash.

00:07:02.477 --> 00:07:03.478
(growling)

00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:05.113
Is that so?

00:07:05.113 --> 00:07:08.049
Speaking of your dear,
beloved brother...

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:11.486
Why don't I show you how
the good fellow is doing?

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:15.256
You didn't have
the itsy-bitsiest clue

00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:18.426
that I already caught him!

00:07:18.426 --> 00:07:19.761
(gasping)

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.461
Nash!

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:24.465
It seems your glorious leader
has seen better days.

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:28.336
Release him,
you treacherous fiend!

00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:30.338
No, I think not.

00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:31.873
I rather like him this way.

00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:36.310
Bound and beaten is a good look
for him, don't you agree?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.278
(both gasping)

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:40.481
Because every time
I get my life points back,

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:44.118
I get my energy by stealing his!

00:07:44.118 --> 00:07:45.119
(gasping)

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.222
You have been drawing
your power from Nash?

00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:49.891
Don't act so surprised!

00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:53.027
My life points have to come
from somewhere, don't they?

00:07:53.027 --> 00:07:56.464
It just so happens I'm taking
them from your little buddy!

00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:58.266
(laughing)

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:01.069
In other words,
the more you hurt me,

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:02.770
the more you hurt him!

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.239
(laughing)

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:11.813
♪♪

00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:13.014
(Girag) Well, well, well!

00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:14.482
If it ain't my old pal Alito.

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:17.018
I can't believe
you betrayed Don Thousand

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:18.119
to team up with Yuma.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:20.955
But I can believe
I'm gonna take you out!

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:21.489
No, Girag...

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:23.458
Don Thousand's the enemy,
not us!

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:24.058
Yuma's right!

00:08:24.058 --> 00:08:26.461
Don Thousand changed
your memories of the past

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.463
so he could control you
in the present!

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.431
He's playing with your mind!

00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:30.965
I don't buy it!

00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:33.801
You're the ones who are
trying to mess with my head!

00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:34.469
Bad move, you twerps!

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:36.771
'Cause now you went
and got me mad!

00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:39.073
So I'm gonna
put the hurt on you!

00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:40.475
Snap out of it!

00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:41.109
It's no use.

00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:43.478
There's only one way to have him
come back to his senses.

00:08:43.478 --> 00:08:45.079
To do to him
what you did to me.

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:48.483
Agreed, we must defeat
Don Thousand's Number...

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:51.486
Yuma and I will use
the Mythyrian Number

00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:53.020
we won from Girag

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.489
to free him.

00:08:54.489 --> 00:08:55.323
No.

00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:57.859
I'm the one who's gonna duel.

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:58.459
(all gasping)

00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:01.763
But you've lost
your Barian powers!

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:02.196
I know.

00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:05.933
I can no longer play
my strongest Number Card

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:09.303
ever since you released me
of Don Thousand's control.

00:09:09.303 --> 00:09:12.206
Thing is, that doesn't matter.

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:14.475
I have to do this for Girag.

00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:15.376
He's my best friend.

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:19.080
I can't leave him prisoner
to Don Thousand's power.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.149
(Girag snickers)

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:23.484
I understand.

00:09:23.484 --> 00:09:27.388
Well then, you're gonna
need this, Alito.

00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:29.724
Beat Girag with this Number.

00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:31.826
It'll free him of Don Thousand.

00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:34.962
I won't let you down, Yuma.

00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:35.463
We know it.

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:38.032
We're behind you
every step of the way.

00:09:38.032 --> 00:09:39.467
Okay!

00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:41.035
Girag!
It's time to duel!

00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:44.372
That's what I've been
waitin' for, you traitor!

00:09:44.372 --> 00:09:46.340
You're through!

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.709
(roaring)

00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:50.878
Oh, yeah?

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:54.148
I wouldn't be
so sure of that, Girag!

00:09:54.148 --> 00:09:55.483
Hah!

00:09:55.483 --> 00:09:56.083
♪♪

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.857
(both) Let's duel!

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:06.828
Ring the bell so that I
can ring <i>your</i> bell!

00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:12.166
Come on out,
Battlin' Boxer Big Bandage!

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:20.007
I place two cards face down...
and end my turn!

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:21.209
I'm not impressed!

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:24.278
This'll be easier
than I thought!

00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:26.480
Are you saying that our attacks

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.218
have been hurting Nash
all this time?

00:10:30.218 --> 00:10:31.819
No!

00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:35.156
(sobbing) Marin!

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.824
(growling)

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:39.060
You vicious maniac!

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.460
(laughing)

00:10:39.694 --> 00:10:44.465
You must admit,
I'm an <i>inventive</i> vicious maniac!

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:45.466
Inventive?

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:46.934
More like sick and depraved!

00:10:46.934 --> 00:10:49.470
Your madness ends now!

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.238
Hmm...

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:54.108
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
The Seventh One!

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.911
That allows me to rebuild
the Overlay Network

00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:01.816
with Number 102:
Star Seraph Sentry!

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:07.154
Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:11:07.154 --> 00:11:08.990
I summon...

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:14.831
Chaos Number 102,
Archfiend Seraph!

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.836
You will not drain any more
life points from Nash!

00:11:21.836 --> 00:11:24.705
If the only way to break
this cruel cycle

00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:27.341
is to defeat you in one turn,

00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:29.343
then defeat you I shall!

00:11:29.343 --> 00:11:30.044
Do it.

00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:32.480
I activate the spell
Celestial Rage

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.782
from my graveyard!

00:11:34.782 --> 00:11:35.850
By banishing it,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.888
Archfiend Seraph gains
2,000 attack points.

00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:43.457
Clearly you must struggle
with mathematics,

00:11:43.457 --> 00:11:46.761
because that's not enough
attack points to defeat me!

00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:47.461
Perhaps not yet,

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:50.431
but I activate Archfiend
Seraph's special ability!

00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.335
By using one Chaos Overlay
Unit, your monster loses

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:58.973
all its attack points
and special abilities!

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:02.410
What?!

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.479
It means when
Archfiend Seraph attacks,

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:08.215
you will take
4900 points of damage!

00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:10.952
Your life points will be
gone in one strike.

00:12:10.952 --> 00:12:12.853
But if it makes you
feel any better,

00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:16.457
I will be going out with
a bang right along with you!

00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:18.960
What are you saying?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.162
That due to
Celestial Rage's effect,

00:12:21.162 --> 00:12:24.832
I'll take the same
amount of damage as you.

00:12:24.832 --> 00:12:25.466
Dumon!

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.969
You're willing to sacrifice
yourself to defeat me?

00:12:27.969 --> 00:12:31.939
Archfiend Seraph,
attack Manipulator of Souls

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:36.811
and finish this
once and for all!

00:12:42.483 --> 00:12:44.218
<i>Play your trap, fool!</i>

00:12:44.218 --> 00:12:47.488
Oh! I activate the trap
Evil 1!

00:12:47.488 --> 00:12:51.258
It prevents my monster
from being destroyed,

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:51.959
but that's not all!

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:56.030
No matter how much damage
you deal me, I'm still left

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.799
with one life point!

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:01.235
Aah...!

00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:02.169
Dumon!

00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:03.471
(grunting)

00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:05.439
(groaning)

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:07.041
That was close, Dumon.

00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:11.278
Good thing I'm a far better
duelist than you are.

00:13:11.278 --> 00:13:12.480
(groaning)

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.214
Amateur!

00:13:13.214 --> 00:13:17.284
Now if you're done trying to
outsmart a real duelist,

00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:19.253
finish your turn!

00:13:19.253 --> 00:13:20.388
I end my turn.

00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:25.426
Archfiend Seraph's
attack points
return to normal.

00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:26.827
Shame, shame, shame!

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:27.928
Look at what you've done!

00:13:27.928 --> 00:13:29.930
Your monster's attack points
may have gone down,

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.467
but thanks to Nash, my life
points are going back up!

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:35.302
No!
Nash!

00:13:35.302 --> 00:13:38.239
Could you bring the screaming
down to a whisper?

00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:40.474
Some of us
are trying to win here.

00:13:40.474 --> 00:13:43.795
<i>Vector, enough</i>
<i>with your foolishness!</i>

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:47.799
<i>Without our trap card,</i>
<i>you would have lost!</i>

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:49.735
But I didn't lose, did I?

00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:51.703
I know what I'm doing.

00:13:51.703 --> 00:13:52.738
Do not worry.

00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:56.041
Our victory is moments away!

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.778
♪♪

00:13:59.778 --> 00:14:03.048
You already have your hands full
with Giant Red Hand,

00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:08.120
but I'm also summoning
Fire Hand to heat things up!

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:14.726
(grunting)

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:18.130
And it also lets me
summon Prominence Hand

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.434
so I can tighten my grip
on this duel!

00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:29.574
(grunting)

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:31.510
Now for my favorite part!

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:37.182
I overlay Level 4 Fire Hand
and Prominence Hand!

00:14:37.182 --> 00:14:38.750
With these two monsters,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.355
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon!

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:46.124
Let's set the duel on fire!

00:14:46.124 --> 00:14:49.795
Number 58: Burner Visor!

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:59.504
I sense Don Thousand's power
emanating from that Number.

00:14:59.504 --> 00:15:01.807
So Don Thousand created it too?

00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:02.474
Yes.

00:15:02.474 --> 00:15:04.776
When Alito faced one
of Don Thousand's Numbers

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:06.278
his chances were grim.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:08.780
Taking on two is unthinkable!

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.784
And Burner Visor uses
all its Overlay Units

00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:16.721
so that it can equip
onto Giant Red Hand!

00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:18.623
This allows Giant Red Hand

00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:21.326
to attack you directly, Alito!

00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:28.200
Giant Red Hand,
let's knuckle down on this fool.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.371
(Yuma gasps)
Prepare for a pummeling!

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:34.806
Dumon! Marin!

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:36.341
I'm afraid your time is up!

00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:40.111
I send the trap Evil 1
to the graveyard

00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:41.780
to activate its effect:

00:15:42.013 --> 00:15:44.683
I won't be able to battle
this turn,

00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:47.152
but it will be well worth it.

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:48.620
(both gasp)

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.187
Why?

00:15:49.187 --> 00:15:53.492
Because now I get to destroy
any card on the field!

00:15:53.492 --> 00:15:57.095
(laughing)

00:15:57.095 --> 00:16:01.066
Curious which card I'll pick?

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:03.268
I won't keep you in suspense!

00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:06.605
I'll destroy... Damage Pot!

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:08.807
But that's your own card!

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:09.774
Quite right!

00:16:09.774 --> 00:16:12.143
But when it leaves
the field, the pot breaks

00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:15.313
and spills all the damage
it sucked up earlier,

00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:19.451
meaning we each take
1300 points of damage!

00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:21.786
That's more
than you have, Dumon,

00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.422
and more than you have
as well, Marin!

00:16:24.422 --> 00:16:28.059
So, you don't survive,
but I do!

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:29.461
(laughing)

00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:32.097
It's "bye-bye" time, kiddies!

00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:36.801
There must be something
I can do!

00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:39.237
(groaning)

00:16:39.237 --> 00:16:40.805
Marin...

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:50.315
I activate the trap
Sacred Shield!

00:16:50.315 --> 00:16:51.650
It cleans up the mess you made

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:56.221
by absorbing all the damage
your trap card released!

00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:57.188
No!

00:16:57.188 --> 00:16:58.123
Oh, yes.

00:16:58.123 --> 00:16:59.791
And it gives Ragnafinity

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:01.793
all the points we would have
taken as damage.

00:17:02.027 --> 00:17:07.799
So this means
Ragnafinity gains
3900 attack points!

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:10.335
(growling)

00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:13.805
Now it has 6700
attack points....

00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:15.807
Dumon... you're brilliant!

00:17:15.807 --> 00:17:17.776
This makes Ragnafinity
powerful enough

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:20.312
to defeat Vector!
We'll win!

00:17:20.312 --> 00:17:21.780
Dumon?

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.583
Not "we", Marin... you.

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:25.784
What do you mean?

00:17:26.017 --> 00:17:28.787
Sacred Shield
has one final effect.

00:17:28.787 --> 00:17:31.790
I must take all the damage
that it absorbed

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.558
at the end of this turn.

00:17:33.558 --> 00:17:35.794
That means you'll lose!

00:17:35.794 --> 00:17:36.261
(laughing)

00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:39.097
I thought
we could beat him together,

00:17:39.097 --> 00:17:41.666
but unfortunately,
it was not to be.

00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:44.436
You must defeat him
on your own.

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.437
Oh!

00:17:45.437 --> 00:17:49.708
You and Nash meant more
to me than anything, Marin.

00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:51.543
Good times or bad,

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:55.080
I cherish every moment
we spent together.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.183
I wish there
could have been more.

00:17:58.183 --> 00:18:01.786
Marin, I am counting on you!

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:04.789
I end my turn.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.598
Dumon!

00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:16.668
Goodbye, Marin and Nash...

00:18:16.668 --> 00:18:23.108
It was a great honor to fight
by your side, my friends.

00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:26.111
Dumon!

00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:39.791
Giant Red Hand,
annihilate Alito!

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.361
Aah!

00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:45.163
No! Alito!

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:53.071
(groaning)

00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:54.506
(all gasping)

00:18:55.573 --> 00:18:57.609
Is that all you've got, Girag?

00:18:57.609 --> 00:18:58.143
(laughing)

00:18:58.143 --> 00:19:00.779
I'm just getting started,
you little punk!

00:19:00.779 --> 00:19:03.314
If I send a card
to the graveyard,

00:19:03.314 --> 00:19:07.816
Burner Visor deals you
500 more points of damage!

00:19:08.634 --> 00:19:09.869
(grunts)

00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:14.373
This is trouble!

00:19:14.373 --> 00:19:15.875
Hang in there!

00:19:18.544 --> 00:19:19.145
Aah...!

00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:24.383
If you liked that...

00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:25.651
Have another!

00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:28.854
Aah...!

00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:29.421
Good news!

00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:32.858
This last card will put you
out of your misery!

00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:34.660
Toodle-oo, chump!

00:19:35.394 --> 00:19:36.862
You haven't beaten me yet!

00:19:36.862 --> 00:19:39.865
I activate the trap
Hyper Burning!

00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:41.500
Know what it does, Girag?

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.369
My life points
are halved... (grunts)

00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:45.871
but it blocks all your damage.

00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:53.279
Huh?!

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:55.881
Face it, Girag.

00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:57.283
You can't beat me.

00:19:57.283 --> 00:20:00.219
Not when I'm this fired up!

00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:02.788
Aah!

00:20:02.788 --> 00:20:04.223

Even without his Barian powers,

his spirit is invincible.

Attaboy, Alito!

00:20:13.563 --> 00:20:15.598
Take him down for the count!

00:20:15.598 --> 00:20:17.934
You're through!

00:20:17.934 --> 00:20:19.035
Aah!

00:20:19.035 --> 00:20:20.904
Thank you, Dumon.

00:20:20.904 --> 00:20:24.207
I will always keep you
within my heart.

00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:26.442
Nash and I
will never forget you.

00:20:26.442 --> 00:20:30.914
I'll make sure your
hard work was not in vain!

00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:33.783
You will pay, Vector!

00:20:33.783 --> 00:20:35.652
Wha... aah...!

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:40.790
Thanks to Dumon, Ragnafinity
has 6700 attack points!

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.959
Your monster has none.

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:44.194
Your monster can't use

00:20:44.194 --> 00:20:46.196
its special abilities, either.

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:46.829
Wha...?!

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.065
I think you know what
that means, don't you?

00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:52.202
That there's nothing
you can do to stop this...

00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:56.639
Ragnafinity,
attack Manipulator of Souls!

00:20:59.209 --> 00:21:00.076
In the blink of an eye,

00:21:00.076 --> 00:21:04.681
you're going to be
just a bad memory!

00:21:09.118 --> 00:21:10.186
Aah!

00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:18.995
I did it, Dumon.

00:21:18.995 --> 00:21:19.862
I won.

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:20.530
I will never forget

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.067
that it would not have happened
without you, my friend.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:26.102
