Challenging
me was a mistake

00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.979
and it's going to burn you
in the end!

00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:11.812
Now, I activate
the trap card Infernal Sun!

00:17:13.312 --> 00:17:15.779
I can use it when a monster
that has 2,000

00:17:15.812 --> 00:17:18.345
or more attack points
strikes at me directly.

00:17:18.379 --> 00:17:20.579
The trap deals you 800 points
of damage

00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:22.745
for every card
in your hand!

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.545
Oh nein!

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.312
(yelling)

00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:41.679
Just as I thought.

00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:43.645
There is
a spell marker here.

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:47.712
The card that was facedown is
Dian Keto, the Cure Master.

00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:50.245
Its effect
will make me stronger,

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:53.379
increasing my life points
by 1,000.

00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:57.812
Very clever, Quinton.

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.379
Quattro and Shark are eager to
win right away,

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.079
but Quinton
uses his brains,

00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:04.445
just like me.

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:08.379
And now it's time to see how
clever Yuma Tsukumo is.

00:18:08.412 --> 00:18:10.879
This is a dueltopia!

00:18:10.912 --> 00:18:13.245
We gotta get in
on the action, Tori!

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:16.412
I predict you will soon
see plenty of action.

00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:17.812
Right over there.
Huh?

00:18:23.379 --> 00:18:25.079
Why'd they
let me pass by?

00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:32.379
It was thoughtful of him
to leave late.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:33.545
We didn't have to lure him away

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.912
from the other duelists before
we pounce.

00:18:35.945 --> 00:18:38.612
Demolishing that kid
should be a piece of cake!

00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:41.145
And the cash we get will be
the icing!

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:44.545
It's perfect!

00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:47.545
Those mercenaries
won't let up on Yuma.

00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:49.245
He'll be pushed to the limit

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:52.379
and then I'll be able to find
out how good he really is!

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:56.879
Okay, it's time
to make our move.

00:18:56.912 --> 00:18:58.179

What're they up to?

00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:15.945
They are staging
a joint attack.

00:19:15.979 --> 00:19:18.545
It appears
you have been ambushed!

00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.245
They have sandwiched your car

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:22.479

another lane.

"T" mark up ahead?

It's a trap card!

That was the trap
Secret Barrel.

For each card in
your hand and on your field,

you take 200 points
of damage.
