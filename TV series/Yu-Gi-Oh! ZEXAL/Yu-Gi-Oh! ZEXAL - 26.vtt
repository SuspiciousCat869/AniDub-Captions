What could be
taking him so long?

TORI: Looks like you woke up on
the right side of the bed today.

Every side's the right
one this morning,

The world Duel carnival!

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.530
That explains it.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.790
Yeah, you bet it does Tori.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.560
This is gonna be the best
Duel tournament ever thrown!

Due in No small part to
what the duelists could win!

Not only will the Winner be
immortalized as a champion for

lifetime pass to heartland!

when ya Hear the next part.

Mr. Heartland himself has
promised to grant the tournament

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.760
Winner one wish and make it come
True no matter what it takes!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.790
Really?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.160
I already know my wish.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It's gonna be to wish
for a hundred more wishes,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.390
how smart is that?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.660
Maybe you should just
wish for a less goofy hat.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.530
Cathy: I know what I'd wish
for. A date with yuma...

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.390
so who here's competing?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.530
Better believe I am, see?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.630
What's that thing?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030
It's a heart piece.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.460
It's what ya need to gain
entry into the duel carnival!

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.560
I got mine in the
mail just this week!

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.690
Me too!

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.090
Me three!

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.530
So everyone's in this.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.090
Not everyone...

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.130
huh? What do you mean?

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.730
Surely you're competing.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.830
Who me?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.930
I'm passing.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.290
Since when do you
pass on dueling?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.360
Since today...

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.830
when the postman rode right

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.090
past my house without
giving me that heart piece!

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.060
Now the only flow I feel
is the flow of tears!

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.390
Yuma...

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.960
Please, you are embarrassing
me, and I am invisible.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.830
That's how I feel,
invisible to the world!

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.390
I don't get it, why would you
be the only one left out?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.760
Yeah...

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.090
does astral have any idea
what might have happened?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.030
They probably require all
entrants to have some skill.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.230
Kick a guy while he's
down, why don't ya?

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.190
Will someone Please
give me a hug?

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.660
Yuma, you did apply
for the event, right?

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.160
Apply?

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.090
Yeah, you know, fill
out the online app for entry.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.130
Online app?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.390
Like this one here
on the website?

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.960
Don't you see the
giant icon to apply?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.360
Is that what that's for?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.460
I kinda thought it was
just a cool little picture.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.630
It is.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.090
A picture showing you how
to apply for the tournament!

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.560
Oh...

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.630
it could've happened to anyone.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.630
Actually no, this would
only happen to you, yuma.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.590
At least now you will not
have to embarrass yourself.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.630
Yuma,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.790
quit moping.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.190
Just apply right now.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.490
Good thinking!

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.990
It just wants my name,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.060
then my address,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.360
and voila.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.960
I'm all set!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.460
Mr. Heartland:
Thank you for applying,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.060
but registration is closed.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.560
What?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.730
Snooze, you lose.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.560
Try again next year.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.460
[screaming]

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.330
yuma, what are you doing?

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.830
Runnin' from my problems!

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.590
SHARK: Yuma,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.230
what in the world are you doing?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.690
What's it look like I'm doing?

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.990
I'm totally freaking out!

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.030
Lemme Guess,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.890
this has to do with
the tournament?

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.130
Yeah, you wouldn't happen to
have an extra one of those heart

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.460
pieces, would ya?

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.630
Afraid not.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.330
In fact, I don't even
have one for me.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.390
What?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.760
The only person I duel
for now yuma, is myself.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.230
Cool.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.290
Later.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.730
Later, shark!

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.830
Yuma...

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.260
shark?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.330
That's right.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.090
Quattro: Long time
no see, Reginald.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.230
I'm sorry,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.530
everyone calls you
shark now, don't they?

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.790
That's right.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.060
What's the duel card
supposed to mean?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.990
I simply thought it might come
in handy in the duel carnival.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.130
I'm not entering
the tournament.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.790
Oh my...

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.860
you're still holding on to
that old burden, aren't you?

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.090
What burden?

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.430
Perhaps a story will
jog your memory.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.630
It takes place during the
finals of a duel tournament.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.560
Where you spied on your
opponent's deck and were then

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.460
disqualified.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.560
You do remember your
opponent, don't you?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.390
It was me.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.790
So?

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.730
So there was more to your spying
then just wanting to win,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.790
correct?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.430
Mystery GIRL: Reginald... at
the finals... promise me...

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.230
that you'll win...

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.290
win for me,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.590
you need to.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.890
I don't blame you.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.760
You wanted to win
so badly for her.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.060
How could you resist my
conveniently placed duel deck?

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.660
Why it's almost as though that
deck was left out on purpose.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.690
You mean...

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.490
you set me up!

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.590
Why you...

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.430
what's done is done.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.990
And that includes
your duel career.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.560
Because Ever Since that day,
you've been a no-Name nobody.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.990
Whereas I have been winning

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.860
trophy after trophy
on the duel circuit.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.860
That must make you feel like...

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.330
a loser.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.730
No, I'm not!

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.360
So then prove it Reginald.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.860
Face me in the world
duel carnival.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860
If you dare.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.260
Oh, I dare all right.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.590
[laughing]

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.730
Reginald will be participating

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.360
in the world Duel carnival
just as you wished.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.890
Vetrix: Excellent, I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.130
Of course.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.190
But still, I must ask,
does he really matter?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.260
He's but an empty shell now.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.330
Perhaps, but he still
has a part to play.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.060
All will become clear once
I've gathered the numbers.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.090
You'll see.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.130
Very well.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.560
Until then,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.360
I'll just enjoy putting shark
through the Ringer again.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.130
Please, I'm begging you!

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.030
You have no idea what
this means to me!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.830
You have to let me
in the tournament!

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.930
RECEPTIONIST :I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do, young man.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.530
But thank you for stopping by.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.090
No, you don't understand!

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.130
This is a matter of life
and...and... and me being so

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.130
heartbroken I can't go on!

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.060
Yep!

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.590
Uh-Oh, here it comes!

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.390
My vitals are slowing...

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.230
my body can't take it!

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.590
Alright Then,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.160
have a very nice day!

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.260
Nice day?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.530
How can I have a nice day if
I'm not in the duel carnival?

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.930
C'mon, gimme a heart piece!
Pleeeaaase!

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.690
You certainly have to give
him points for perseverance.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.560
Announcement: Welcome to all
duel carnival travelers.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.290

lower level and all ground

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.330
Please enjoy your stay here in
our fair city and good luck in

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.830
the tournament!

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.130
Control ROBOT: Heartland city
population has increased by 158%

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.990
and continues to
increase every hour.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.360
Did you hear that?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.590
NISTRO: Duelists are
coming in by the droves!

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.460
This is better than we hoped!

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.130
DEXTRA: Are all
city systems online?

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.290
Security systems are
online and operational.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.390
Network transmissions
are online and operational.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.060
All service bots are
online and operational.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.590
You hear that?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.090
We're all good!

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.260
All of us except
for you, nistro.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.660
What?

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.190
Just because things are running
smoothly now doesn't mean

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.990
they'll stay that way.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.290
We must stay sharp.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.430
Ha!

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.060
I'm as sharp as they come!

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.090
But you,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.890
you're the dullest
knife in the drawer!

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.430
You're lucky I'm here to
pick up your Slack, dextra!

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.530
Oh Please.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.330
That's enough, the both of you.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.430
If This is going to work,
we need to work together.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.230
Ah, Kite.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.960
I've been waiting for you.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.660
Kite: Why'd you
call me here, heartland?

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.960
I have things to do.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.890
Yes, I know you're busy,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.960
but not so busy that you can't
behold the spectacle, the glory

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.860
that is the world Duel carnival!

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.960
Look at them all.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.790
So happy, so excited, so
completely and utterly clueless.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.960
They have no idea the only
reason we've assembled them here

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.960
is to snatch their number cards!
And when I say 'we' I mean you.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.990
After all, you're
the one that dr. Faker

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.390
is counting on most you know.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.530
Don't let him down.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.130
After all, there are many
powerful duelists competing.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.830
Well you know what I say?

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.360
Bring 'em on!

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.760
Whatever Numbers
Kite here can't take,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.130
I'll be more
than happy to nab.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.490
Appreciate the offer,
but I got this.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.490
See, he's full of
confidence just like me!

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.160
Cause he's earned it.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.090
Worker a: Mr. Heartland,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.430
there's a young duelist without
a heart piece who wants to

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.430
compete!

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.760
And I should care why?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.130
Because...

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.790
he's been at the city gate
Since quite early this morning,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.190
and I don't think he's going
anywhere anytime soon.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.190
Please, I'll give you my entire
life's saving for a heart piece,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.060
that's almost
seventy-Five cents!

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.190
It's him.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.660
Send in more security,
take him away.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.790
Right!

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.790
Hold it,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.990
let's let the little
rat participate.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.990
You know him?

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.430
No.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.960
But you never know who might
have a number card these days.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.690
I say,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.390
are you sure you're not
hiding something, Kite?

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.960
The other day, there was a
mysterious explosion at a

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.160
heartland facility.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.590
I don't know
anything about that.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.060
All I care about
is gathering numbers.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.490
Now please excuse me,

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.260
I have to go and prepare
for the tournament.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.290
You're excused.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.730
Orbital 7: Master Kite,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.430
why didn't you report that yuma
was involved with that blast?

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.190
Quiet, or I'll power
you down permanently!

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.090
Sir, quieting down!

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.730
the only one I'm focused on...

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.090
is astral.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.330
And I will have
my revenge on him!

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.090
Uh, you're not still
talking about me, are you?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.360
As for yuma,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.590
he is harmless.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.630
Really?

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.790
Harmless?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.330
Except to himself.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.130
I am not leaving here until
someone gives me a heart piece!

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.160
I'm not kidding,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
I'm a kid!

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.430
I've got nothing better to do!

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.230
Wow, several hours and
yuma's still going strong.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.330
Yeah...

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.830
whoa, what's this?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.530
Whoa, no way!

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.160
Is that Mr. Heartland?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.490
It just can't be.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.730
Hey dude.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.730
Hey dude?

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.530
Not a good start.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.560
Worker B: Mister.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.860
It's mister heartland.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.860
Mister?

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.160
Then what do they
call his dad?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.260
Worker C: Say it!

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.360
Fine. Hey, missus heartland.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.530
Mister!

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.490
Oh right, sorry. Mister.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.190
It's just when I look
at the color of that suit,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.230
I think missus.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.630
No offense.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.960
Anyway, now that I got ya here,
I was wondering if maybe you

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.290
could hook me up with a
heart piece, pretty please?

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.560
Yuma Should Really pick
his words more carefully.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.990
I agree, it's just he doesn't
have that many to choose from.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.530
My dear boy,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.690
I have heard your plight, which
is why I've decided to come here

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.160
personally and give you...

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.690
this small gift.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.730
Heads up!

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.760
A heart piece!

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.230
I finally got one!

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.830
Now I get to compete!

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.930
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.130
What is that pendant there?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.890
What... this?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.630
It has a unique shape.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.660
I guess.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.530
It was a gift from
my mom and dad.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.890
Was it?

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.190
there is something special
about this boy after all.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.630
You must be excited, yuma.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.590
This is what you've
always dreamt of.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.630
A chance to finally become
a real life duel champion!

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.690
Yeah.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.490
Yuma...

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.460
there is more to
it than just that.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.660
This is a very big
tournament you are in.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.690
And a big tournament means there
will be a lot of duelists.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.430
Which means there could
be a lot of number cards.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.630
Right, and with each one
we get, you get back a memory.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.230
And to tell you the truth,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.690
that's the real reason that I
wanted this heart piece so bad.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.490
What do you mean, yuma?

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.490
I thought this was all about you

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.360
becoming a duel champion
for your father.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.530
Yeah,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.060
and it still kind of is,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.630
but when I think about my dad
and all the things he's said,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.360
I think it would mean more to
him if I dueled for something

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.930
else, an even bigger cause.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.260
If I dueled for something
meaningful like a bond.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.360
A bond?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.460
Yeah!

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.560
Like the bond we have, astral.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.060
Like the bond I've felt with
every duelist I've ever faced!

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.790
See, it's not about whether you
win or lose, dueling's about

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.830
something more
precious than that.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.090
Something on a
whole other level.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.230
That is not True for all.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.230
Whatcha mean?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.690
I mean Kite.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.830
Losing is not an option for him.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.260
And he does not
give second chances.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.290
Yeah, he wins, I lose and
instead of dueling, I end up

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.430
drooling like a mindless zombie.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.230
But don't you worry astral, I'm
not afraid of going head-to-Head

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.630
with him, 'cause
I could always...

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.360
yuma...

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.590
what's up?

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.860
Yuma...

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.860
if anything bad
happens to you I'll...

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.960
I'll...

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.030
hey!

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.030
Don't cry!

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.230
I'm gonna be just fine!

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.530
Like I'd be scared
of someone named Kite.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.930
Please,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.590
I'll make him beg like a dog.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.990
Okay, relax.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.690
I don't care what his name
is or if you make him beg,

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.860
I really just
care about one thing.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.560
That you beat him.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.430
And get outta this tournament
in one piece, understand?

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.460
Otherwise,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.590
you'll have me to deal with!

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.960
Interesting. Dueling is about
something more precious than

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.660
winning or losing. Something on
a whole other level. But what,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.130
yuma? What?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.130
Choices, choices.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.930
Man, it's hard to build a deck.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.290
And I got a hunch
not just for me.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:59.000
little brother, I promise you
things will be as they were.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.590
Crowd: Check it out!

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.660
How fast are they going?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.290
They must be going light-Speed!

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.890
Look at all those hearts!

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.130
They're so beautiful!

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.830
This parade is amazing!

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.060
Those floats are so cool!

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.160
I can't believe
it's finally here!

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.260
Yeah!

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.830
Welcome duelists to
heartland city. Welcome to

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.230
the world Duel carnival!

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.230
Now then, here are the rules.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.860
The field of play
is the entire city,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.860
and the first phase of this
tournament will last three days.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.730
During these three days, if you
are challenged to a duel, you

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.530
must accept that challenge.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.030
How do you accept a challenge?

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.460
Simple: You will Wager
your heart piece.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.790
Lose your heart piece,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.030
and you lose your spot here.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.860
But if you win,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.590
you win a heart piece!

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.230
Assemble All five pieces and
you'll have won a spot in the

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.590
tournament finals!

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.130
If you have further questions
about the rules, well,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.530
that's just too bad!

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.160
Because I'm sure like our
viewers at home, I can't wait

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.560
another second to get started!

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.790
So let the duels begin!

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.090
Aww Yeah!

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.460
It's every duelist
for himself now!

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.830
See ya in the finals!

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.630
Wonder Who'll make
the first move?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.690
Yeah,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.130
and who that person's
gonna challenge!

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.260
STRIKER: Outta my way!

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.660
Move it!

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.830
Since winning this tournament is
my goal, I'll let my soccer ball

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.990
pick my opponent!

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.990
That looks like it hurt.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.630
What's your problem?

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.930
This is a duel tournament,
not a soccer match!

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.930
For me they're one
and the same. Now then,

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.960
get up ball boy,
'cause we're duel

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.000
So, I'm first?
