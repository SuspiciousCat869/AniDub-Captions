00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.866
my family's actions.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:38.900
Why we came here to compete
in the Duel Carnival

00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:42.300
and why we targeted
Kite and his brother Hart.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.200
The answer is that they are
linked to our real enemy.

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:48.066
We seek revenge against
their father, Dr. Faker.

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.600
Dr. Faker
is their father?

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:55.140
You mean the same guy
who built up Heartland?

00:08:56.473 --> 00:08:57.840
It began five years ago.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.440

Back then, Dr. Faker
and my father,

Byron Arclight,

00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:04.606

on experiments

00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:07.106

that could lead to other worlds.

missing in my calculations.

Dr. Faker, please,

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:26.473

and try to relax.

to meet you.

These are the most advanced
gravitational wave scans

advanced enough!

I've tried every possible
technology

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.173
but still can't find

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.213

portal!

It must exist,
I'm sure of it!

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:51.180
But there's something
we're missing!

00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:54.280
Kazuma, you've been looking
for the portal, too.

00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:57.013
Would you be willing to
share your research with us?

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:03.046
If we succeed, it will change
the course of human history.

You will become famous

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:07.113

Money and fame!

They're of
no interest to me!

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.213
All I care about is locating

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.446
that inter-dimensional
portal!

00:11:17.513 --> 00:11:20.280
In that case,
we can work together.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.980
That was a test,
wasn't it?

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:25.313
Living for adventure
and the thrill of discovery

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.546
are all I care about.

00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:29.246
I'd say we found
the right partner.

00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:32.313
Take a look at this.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.413
Arclight and I have detected
abnormal gravity readings

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.313
at 21 different
locations around the globe.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.913
We believe these
readings indicate

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.213
where the inter-dimensional
portal has emerged

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.380
in the past.

00:11:43.446 --> 00:11:44.886
By analyzing this data,

00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:46.120
we were hoping to
predict

00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:48.320
where the portal
will next appear.

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:50.553
So you based your
prediction on this data?

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:55.320
Yes, the calculation
is quite complicated.

00:11:55.386 --> 00:11:57.286
I almost have it
solved.

00:11:57.353 --> 00:11:59.953
But there's
one piece missing.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.620
(Kazuma)
No, you're missing
two pieces.

00:12:02.853 --> 00:12:04.520
Your observations
are incomplete, Doctor.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.020
Some discoveries can only
be made

00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.620
outside a laboratory.

00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:12.253
I found two more locations
on my expeditions.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.086
There are
23 data points.

00:12:14.153 --> 00:12:16.053
Oh.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.453
Then that's why my
calculations have been off!

00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:21.986
Right, do your math over

00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:24.120
and you should have no trouble
locating the portal.

00:12:26.886 --> 00:12:28.320

Kazuma was correct.

00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:30.086
With the additional data
he supplied,

00:12:30.153 --> 00:12:32.520
Dr. Faker
reworked his calculations.

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:34.220
He soon identified the location

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.953
where the portal
would appear next.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.886

Let go

My son always tells me

when he duels
with someone,

It's the same for me.

Anyone who goes
exploring with me

my friend!

All right.

You'll pay for this,

My father couldn't believe
how Faker betrayed them.

That sounds like
a Xyz Summon.

Yuma, one day
my father did return.

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.065
He found a way to
travel through

00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:25.599
inter-dimensional
gaps between the worlds

world again.

However
there was a price.

00:17:29.232 --> 00:17:30.999
His appearance became warped

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:33.332
until he was no longer
recognizable.

It's all Faker's fault.

He betrayed
my father.

To start,
I summon Photon Thrasher!

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:06.905
I can bring out Thrasher

You're playing into my hands
perfectly, Kite.

(Kite)
Let's see, my Delta Wing
had 1,800 attack points.

It was destroyed

1,000 points of damage.

So then Quinton's
invisible Number

must have 2,800 attack points.

00:19:03.512 --> 00:19:05.945
Galaxy-Eyes, use your
3,000 attack points

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:07.545
