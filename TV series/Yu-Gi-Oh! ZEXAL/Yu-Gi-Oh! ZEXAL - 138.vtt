WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.737
Last time of "Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL"...

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:08.408
King Overfiend,
attack Masquerade!

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:12.212
(explosions)

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.050
Nash destroyed the Number
that Don Thousand gave
to Vector.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.021
Now Vector will regain the
true memories of his past!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.758
No, it's impossible,
what've I done...

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.760
all the destruction I caused.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.363
How could I?

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.098
Don Thousand!

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.202
Now that I have the power
of the other Emperors,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:39.606
I'm stronger than
you'll ever be!

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:44.244
Stop this, Vector!
You need me!

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:44.645
No!

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:52.753
This attack is for every
Emperor you betrayed.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.123
You can't do this, Nash!

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:59.426
(Nash) How could I lose?

He did it!
Shark won the duel!

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.204
(groaning) Impossible!

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:20.707
How could I lose to you?
<i>How?</i>

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.678
Can you hear their
voices yet, Vector?

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.580
Can I hear the what?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.749
Last time we dueled
in this palace,

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.318
just like this time, you lost.

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:33.754
That's when the spirits
haunting this place,

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.223
those of the people who lived
in the countless villages

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:41.294
you destroyed dragged you into
the darkness, where you belong.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.430
Aah! Aah!

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.333
So, do you hear them yet?

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.636
I don't hear a thing!
Get real!

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.072
(ghostly voices moaning)
Vector...

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.641
Aah...

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.545
No, stop it!
Let me go!

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.646
It's over, Vector.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:03.750
Just like before, they will
pull you into the shadows.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.519
(grunts) I don't think so!

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.756
Things are different now!
Release me!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.766
This time I have more power
at my command

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.668
than you could possibly
imagine!

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:26.440
So If I'm going down,
then I'm taking you with me!

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.976
(maniacal laughter)

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.314
Did you think you had won, Nash?

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.451
That it was all over?
You're wrong!

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.620
It hasn't even begun!
I cannot be beaten.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.390
I am all-powerful!
(laughing)

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.761
(demonic voice)
How interesting
that you should say that.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:53.734
The power you wield
is not yours, Vector.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.736
You?
But how can this be?

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.571
Don Thousand!

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.740
I thought you had met your end.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.276
I am quite aware
of what you thought,

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.644
but it is as you say...

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:09.149
One of limitless power
cannot be beaten!

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.584
You meaningless flea!

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.053
Did you honestly believe
that the boundless power

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:17.557
I allowed you to wield
was yours to have forever?

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:21.228
Know this...
what I have given to you,

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.131
I can also take away.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.333
How little you grasp!

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.136
You boasted that
you no longer needed me.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:34.741
Ignorant puppet.
It is I who no longer need you!

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.743
(crying out)

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:42.149
Wait!
I beg your forgiveness!

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.285
Aah...

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.754
No!
This can't be!

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:52.726
It can't end like this!
Somebody help me!

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.761
Vector!

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.998
Yuma!
Come back, Yuma!

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.739
Aah...

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:09.376
I got you!
Grab my hand!

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:16.016
Whatever you do, don't let go!

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.751
Yuma!

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.754
Hang on tight!

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.762
Whatever you do, don't let go!

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.764
Yuma!

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.766
Hang on tight!

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.734
This is most amusing,

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.437
the helpless helping
the hapless!

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.239
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.674
Yuma, you are in great peril!

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.743
Yeah, I know, but I can't
give up now!

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:50.183
Yuma, you know as well as I,
He'll just betray us again!

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:55.488
Maybe he will, but that's
a chance I'm willing to take.

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.057
No matter what he's done,

00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:59.459
everyone deserves
a second chance.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.696
Yes, but this would be
his 30th chance!

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.466
Vector, I've seen
the good in you!

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.002
I saw it in Ray Shadows!

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:15.742
We had awesome times together.
You were my friend.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:21.748
Let's give this thing another
go, pal, what do you say?

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.752
I say that...

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:29.055
you've gotta be the most
trusting simpleton

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.523
who's ever lived!

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:35.762
You really wanna hang out
some more, let's do it!

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.764
Yuma!
(pained cry)

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.567
(insane laughter)

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.703
Come with me to Endsville!

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.472
Sure.
If that's what it takes.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:52.412
I'll stick by your side because
helping a friend is the Ray Way.

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:58.118
Yuma...
(voice echoing)

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:03.023
I've seen the good in you!
You we're my friend.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:09.763
What're you doing?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.132
You're really awesome, Yuma.

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:16.736
Our worlds need more of you
and less of me.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.472
Hang on, what are you saying?

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.975
I'm saying goodbye.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.122
Aah!

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.358
Why did you let go?

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:40.260
(laughing)

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.762
My power has returned to me.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:47.767
Enjoy it now, because
you won't have it for long,

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.369
and that's a promise!

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.405
One you cannot keep!

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.745
At last, I am complete again!

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.748
Astral, we should really
get out of here!

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:07.754
Ugh! And now my true reign
begins!

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.338
What's that light?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:29.075
It is a beacon of the new realm
that I have shaped.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:33.113
I have fused your world
and Barian World together

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:35.749
to forge a dominion
unlike any before!

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:41.488
Turn around, Yuma Tsukumo, and
bear witness to my creation!

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.457
Ah!
It can't be!

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.425
Yes, it is.

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.495
I have shattered the feeble
dimensional barriers

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:51.598
between our two worlds,
and united them

00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:55.368
under one absolute rule,
my own!

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.038
(maniacal laughter)

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.612
Now what?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.748
Mizar?

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.750
We meet again, Yuma.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.285
Why are you here?

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:15.188
This is the last place
I expected to see you.

00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:19.359
Yuma, I came here to fulfill
Kite's last wish.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:24.364
When the duel ended,
he entrusted me with this.

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:26.633
What is it?

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:27.434
Numeron Dragon?

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:31.304
He gave me this card so that
I would give it to you.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.740
Seriously?
But why?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.741
How will this help?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.742
He thought you would need it.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:39.746
But unfortunately, you will
never get a chance to play it.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.748
What do you mean?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:46.052
Look, Nash, Don Thousand
distorted the memories

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.120
of the Seven Emperors.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.755
He tricked us
so we would serve him.

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:53.726
He wanted our aid in his mad
quest to rule the universe.

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:59.766
The future that he is trying
to shape...

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.735
is one I cannot allow
to come to pass.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.737
What are you doing, Mizar?

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.140
Righting our wrongs,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.710
and stopping Don Thousand
once and for all.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.080
Mizar.
You wish to duel me,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.717
despite the loss of your
Barian powers leaving you weak

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:22.322
whilst I have regained
all my immeasurable might!

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.990
Have you lost your mind?

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.426
Your agony and defeat is
inevitable!

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:29.996
Whoa, Don Thousand
looks stronger!

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:33.333
That is his true form.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:38.071
I do not fear the likes of you.

00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.740
Duel Disk, engage!

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.708
So be it.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:46.546
I will grant you the destruction
that you crave.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.755
Let us duel!
Let us duel!

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.228
Let us duel!
Let us duel!

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.731
You should never have
challenged me, Mizar.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.433
It shall be your last mistake.

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.307
I will do nothing more
than end my turn.

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:18.077
What? But you did not do
anything at all!

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:18.745
(chuckling)

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:22.682
Do my moves shake
your resolve, Mizar?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.186
You think a tactic like that
will rattle me?

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.522
Well, think again!

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.757
I draw!

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.395
To begin, I summon
Heliosphere Dragon!

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.231
(shrieking)

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.503
And now I activate the spell
Galaxy Wrath!

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:46.039
If I choose not
to battle this turn,

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.741
I can summon one dragon
from my hand.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.679
Radius,
the Half-Moon Dragon!

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.617
I overlay Heliosphere
and Radius!

00:11:57.617 --> 00:12:01.754
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:06.292
and Xyz Summon Galaxy
Stealth Dragon!

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.562
(roaring)

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:14.767
I activate Stealth Dragon's
special ability!

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.170
For the price of one
Overlay Unit,

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.139
I can summon one Dragon
from my hand.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:23.576
I use two...

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.746
so that I can call two dragons
to my field.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.250
Take flight, Schwarzschild
Limit Dragon

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.054
and Parsec,
the Interstellar Dragon!

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:38.258
Amazing. He's got
three monsters already!

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.995
But the bad news is, he's not
allowed to attack this turn.

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.763
Curious.
Mizar is smart.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.765
I am sure he has a strategy
planned.

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:49.602
I now activate
Dragon King's Demise!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.739
I tribute all my monsters.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:56.743
You will be sorry I did.

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.746
Because by doing so,
we both take damage,

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:03.283
equal to my dragons'
combined attack points.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.752
Say what?
That can't end well at all!

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:09.589
Correct. It would mean the end
for both of them.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.624
Mizar, don't do it!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.760
Your evil ends here,
Don Thousand.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.463
I am ready to do what it takes
to send you to oblivion,

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.766
even if I have to
take you there myself!

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.735
The damage heading your way now
will put a stop

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.704
to your deranged schemes.

00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:26.673
Mizar!

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:37.350
You stopped it?
How can that be?

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.384
You are pathetic.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:41.587
I suggest you take a closer look
at your field.

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:43.756
I-I do not understand.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:47.093
This is not
the spell card I played.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.629
I activated
Dragon King's Demise,

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.765
not Card Of The Dragon King!

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:57.470
And yet, there is no mistake
that Card of the Dragon King

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.671
lies before you.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.740
As with the card
you thought you played,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.176
it too tributes every Dragon
on your field.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.079
Yes, but unlike the card
I had intended to use,

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:09.282
instead of both of us taking
damage, as I planned,

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:10.583
now only I will.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.552
And that means I lose the duel.

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:15.221
This can't really be happening!

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.057
We are done here, Mizar.
You are finished.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:22.495
It is laughable to think that a
paltry wretch like you believed

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:27.166
he could stand against
the great Don Thousand.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.669
Aah...

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.739
Aah...

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:42.749
Are you okay?
Speak to me Mizar, please!

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:45.551
My eagerness turned into
foolish pride, Yuma.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.988
I was so hungry to beat him
that I became careless.

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:52.759
And that is when my victory
plans came undone.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.761
It is up to you now.

00:14:54.761 --> 00:15:00.533
All of you.
Work together.

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:04.103
It is the only way.

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:06.072
Mizar...

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.574
(gasping)

00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:18.518
You stand as the last
of the Seven Emperors, Nash.

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:22.755
You cannot escape your destiny.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:26.426
Your defeat will be
a merciless one.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.128
After which
I will take your power,

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:33.599
as I have that of all
the fallen emperors before you.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:38.504
Such as your beloved sister.

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.606
Soon you will join them,

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:45.611
As will you, Yuma,
and you, Astral.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.347
None of you will escape
this world.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:54.587
I will consume you as I have
consumed so many before you.

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:59.192
So, which one of you has
the nerve to be the next

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:00.726
to fall by my hand?

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:03.095
You wanna duel, let's do it.

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.431
No, let me.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.737
Wait!

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.674
We cannot repeat Mizar's
fatal mistake.

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:18.544
Remember, he told us
to stick together.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:22.315
None of us should duel
Don Thousand alone.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.618
Shark...
Yuma...

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:28.454
let us duel as one!

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.690
Hmm.
Hmm.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.426
Hear that?
We're gonna team up!

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.561
And take you down together.

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.766
With our combined strength,
your reign of terror is over.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.735
Oh...

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.307
Whoo-hoo!
You go, guys!

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:51.511
Duel Disk, go!

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:58.484
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:03.389
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:09.495
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:13.699
Astral, how I have longed
for this moment.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.736
Soon, you will kneel before me
in defeat

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:21.073
and watch as your
world crumbles!

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.743
And now, I draw!

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:27.480
I end my turn.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.549
Hey, he didn't do anything.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:33.119
Tread carefully.
Do not rush this.

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.655
Remember how quickly
Mizar was defeated.

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:39.559
We must stay focused.
Expect the unexpected.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:44.196
I got you.
All right...

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:47.066
I draw!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.435
I summon Toy Knight!

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.071
And this toy doesn't like
to play alone,

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:56.008
so it lets me summon
another monster!

00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:01.080
I summon Gagaga Magician!

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.219
But they're not gonna be around
for long.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:10.690
With these two monsters, I build
the Overlay Network

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:17.029
and Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.534
You seem confident.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:25.371
Let us find out if your
confidence holds

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:29.208
once a new reality sets in.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.749
Utopia!
What's going on?

00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:40.019
Oh...

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:43.222
What is Ganbara Knight
doing here?

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.023
This is very strange!

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:46.759
What trick are you pulling,
Don Thousand?

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:50.529
I do not need tricks!
Simply this trap.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:53.766
I activated Numeron Xyz
Revision.

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:56.636
Numeron Xyz Revision?

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.738
That's how he changed
our cards?

00:18:58.738 --> 00:18:59.739
That is correct.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:05.211
My trap, Numeron Xyz Revision,
allowed me to rewrite your card

00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:08.214
so that instead of summoning
an Xyz Monster,

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:10.750
you summoned a different
monster entirely!

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.553
You are no longer in control
of your actions, I am.

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:18.357
I have mastery over the past,
present and future.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.426
So I rewrote your past.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:23.295
Rewrote the past?
That must mean...

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:27.233
Don Thousand has acquired
the power of the Numeron Code!

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:29.168
Only it can rewrite history!

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.338
No way!
How could he have that?

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:33.139
Astral is correct.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:37.677
Fusing our two worlds together
allowed me to activate

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.745
the field spell
Numeron Network,

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:43.015
giving me mastery
over the Numeron Code.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.017
When I have no cards
on my field,

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:49.288
I can activate a Numeron card
from my deck once per turn

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:52.091
to rewrite this duel
in my favor!

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:55.728
I see.
This explains Mizar's defeat.

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:56.429
Indeed.

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.764
Numeron Network
allowed me to activate

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.766
the trap Numeron
Spell Revision,

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:04.737
which I used to change Mizar's
spell into one that worked

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.005
in my favor instead.

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:10.309
Mizar never stood a chance,
since he was never in control

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.511
of his own cards.

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:17.383
So you rewrote history
to sabotage Mizar's strategy!

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:18.084
Oh, no!

00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:22.221
If Don Thousand can change
their cards, they can't win!

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:22.688
This is odd.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:26.392
How could Don Thousand have the
power of the Numeron Code?

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:29.628
It is hidden on Earth, and only
when all the Numbers are

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.497
collected can it be found,

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:32.765
(gasps) Of course!

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.767
Don Thousand did not need
to find it!

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:38.738
He gained its power when he
merged Earth with Barian World!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:41.173
I wondered when the truth
would dawn on you.

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:45.478
It is true that I do not know
where the Numeron Code rests,

00:20:45.478 --> 00:20:50.549
but I have no need to locate it
when I own the entire planet.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:51.751
The Earth belongs to me.

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:56.722
Down to the smallest molecule,
even the Numeron Code.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:21:01.260
With this new power,
I can finally rip a portal

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.762
between dimensions.

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:06.332
I can now attack Astral World
and annihilate

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:09.668
your wretched home, Astral!

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.571
This cannot be!

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.339
It can!

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:15.674
For every point
of damage you take,

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:16.742
so will Astral World,

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.345
raining devastation on your land
far and wide.

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:24.383
Extinction looms moments away
for both Earth and Astral World,

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:29.288
and you three can do nothing
to stop it!
