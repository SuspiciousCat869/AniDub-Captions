WEBVTT

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.430
Quattro: Which of my fabulous
fans should I take on today?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.760
So many potential
targets to choose from.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.390
Quinton: Your attitude
seriously concerns me, quattro.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.160
Watching your fans
squirm really does give

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.360
you a charge, doesn't it?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.490
I believe you're
jealous, Quinton.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.190
Hey, it isn't my
fault I'm popular.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.690
Besides, those chumps
get what they deserve.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.790
And I have to make my work
interesting somehow, since

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.030
there's never a
chance I'll lose.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.560
Don't be so sure
of that, quattro.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.890
Your arrogance
will be your downfall.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.930
If you don't like how I operate,
then maybe you should start

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.590
collecting numbers.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.460
I will, once the
opponents get tougher.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.290
Really?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.230
So you think you're a
better duelist than me, huh?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.560
Grab your deck and
let's find out.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.390
Trey: Alright, that's
enough, quattro.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.260
We're brothers.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.390
We shouldn't be
amongst ourselves.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.290
Mind your own
business, pipsqueak.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.460
Vetrix: No! Trey
happens to be right.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.560
I approve of your
self-Confidence, quattro.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.960
But you must learn to better
exercise self-Control like the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.260
others.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.590
Excuse me?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.790
Why does it matter
what you actually think?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.860
Watch it, quattro.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.390
What's that?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630
You will show
vetrix some respect.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.990
You won't
talk to him that way.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.590
Fine, Quinton.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.390
I take it you understand
what your mission is today,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.960
don't you, Trey?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.930
Yes, brother.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.760
The duelist they call shark
is still trying to track down

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.590
quattro.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.830
Better hold on to
this number card.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.190
I have a feeling that you'll be
running into each other very

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.930
soon.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.430
Right. I understand.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.660
Dr. Faker, someday I'll
take everything from you,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.230
just like you took
everything from us.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.630
Quinton,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.660
just make Sure faker
doesn't find out about me.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.660
He thinks I'm gone.
I want to leave it that way

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.190
till the day I reveal myself.

Mr. Heartland: Greetings
from heartland city!

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.160
Welcome all!

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.660
It's day two of the
world Duel carnival!

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.560
Today, you can make
your dreams come True.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.230
Just make sure that you all duel
with lots and lots of heart!

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.590
Good luck!

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.990
YUMA: Yes!

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.960
I'm gonna sweep this tournament!

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.560
LILLYBOT: Dream on, yuma!

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.330
Sweeping is my job.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.590
Well I'm doing pretty
awesome so far.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.160
See this?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.390
Is that garbage?

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.760
It looks broken.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.090
No, it's for the tournament and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.660
I have three
heart pieces already.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.930
If I keep winning, I'm
a shoe in for the finals.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.330
I am so feelin' the flow!

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.990
TORI: First, make sure
you win your next duel.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.430
Bronk: Pick
up the pace, Caswell!

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.830
CASWELL: Wait up, bronk!

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.260
They're in a rush,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.730
wonder what's up?

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.660
Pizza Shop must be
givin' out free slices.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.190
Yes!

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.590
Come on, flatfoot!

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.060
Slow down...

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.230
ouch!

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.690
I meant to do that.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.030
Quit goofin' around,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.360
we don't wanna be late!

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.760
Yo!

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.960
Where are you speedin' off to?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.190
Hey guys!

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.560
Haven't you heard?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.260
Quattro's gonna be here.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.730
Who's quattro?

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.730
He's like one of the best
duelists in the world.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.960
He rules!

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.430
Quattro Faced off
against shark in the finals of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.890
the nationals!

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.130
That was him?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.060
Astral: We must be
cautious when dealing

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.030
with this individual, yuma.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.660
Quattro just challenged
bronk and me to duel.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.290
Isn't that awesome?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.530
You guys should turn him down.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.860
Are you kidding?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.890
Somebody told me that quattro
doesn't play by the rulebook.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.760
He is one of the most honest
duelists that you'll ever meet.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.860
This duel is a dream come True.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.490
He's our hero!

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.630
Losing to him will be
a tremendous honor!

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.860
Hey, we're gonna be late!

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.090
Oh Yeah, I almost forgot.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.690
Move it or lose it, 2nd place!

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.890
Hey!

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.230
Wait, we're comin' too!

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.430
This is a strange
place to have a duel.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.030
Quattro picked the spot.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.160
Probably wanted someplace
quiet to avoid his fans.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.990
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.360
Uh... I guess.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.930
Together: Quattro!

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.860
I can't believe
it's really you.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.660
You must be
Caswell and bronk.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.590
My apologies
for being late.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.390
Shall we get
started, my friends?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.330
Yeah, but before we do...

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.030
can I have your autograph?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.530
Me too, me too!

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.960
With pleasure.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.430
I get a thrill out
of spoiling my fans.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.560
Is this okay?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.260
Quattro, I can't
thank you enough.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.230
Don't forget me!

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.690
Here. Happy?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.030
Very!

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.460
Now Let's get dueling.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.590
Hey bronk, who do you
think should go first?

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.890
I dunno...

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.260
I suppose all three
of us could duel at once.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.230
We can have a battle royale,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.830
and put all our heart
pieces on the line.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.160
A battle royale?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.390
Interesting.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.390
Under battle royale rules, all
three duelists will compete

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.230
against each other.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.990
But quattro must think that
bronk and Caswell will both try

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.460
to defeat him.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.390
So in effect, this will
really be a two-on-One duel.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.190
Even though quattro is more
experienced, the odds will be

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.760
against him.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.890
I just love spoiling my fans.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.330
I want this duel
to be special for you.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.890
There's even a chance that
together you could beat me.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.860
It should be a
memorable matchup!

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.360
Guess they were right.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.960
Quattro is cool!

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.060
All set?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.490
Yeah!

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.760
Duel Disk go!

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.090
Get ready!

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.930
I'm not holding back, so get set
for the most intense duel of

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.190
your lives!

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.260
Duel Gazer Let's roll!

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.050
Let's duel!

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.060
I'll let you two go first.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.960
But wait, the duelist who goes
last is at a big disadvantage in

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.790
a battle royale.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.660
I guess he's giving
us another break.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.430
I'll make the first move.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.690
Here goes!

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.530
I draw, and I'm summoning
the monster aye-Iron!

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.130
But under the rules of a battle
royale, nobody can attack until

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.260
all the duelists take one turn.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.730
So I'm done.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.090
It's your move, Caswell.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.330
Okey-Dokey,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.790
I draw!

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.630
And first I'm
summoning debugger x!

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.660
And now it's your turn, quattro.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.960
Well Well,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.730
you've chosen very
unusual monsters.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.260
Nice work, you guys.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.990
I can see you're both
shrewd and creative.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.290
Did you hear that?

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.890
He just praised us, bronk.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.130
I know, but we should
keep our guards up.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.760
Now gentlemen, I draw!

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.460
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.360
But I'm not done yet.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.630
Next I'll place
two more cards facedown.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.330
And finally, I activate the
field spell xyz colosseum!

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.230
This spell boosts the attack
points of all xyz monsters in

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.430
the colosseum by
two hundred points,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.130
but if your monster isn't an xyz
monster, then you're out of luck

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.990
because it can't attack.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.360
And now I end my turn.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.330
This field looks old and creepy.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.630
Why did quattro choose this
field for a confrontation?

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.960
It is True that his xyz monsters
will have more power, but so

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.830
will the xyz monsters
of his opponents.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.260
I see what he's up to.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.530
You can't summon an xyz monster
till you have at least two

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.390
monsters with the same level.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.890
That's why quattro did it.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.460
He played his field spell to
stop our attacks till he draws

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.990
the cards he needs.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.990
Unless, we outsmart him.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.290
Hey quattro, check this!

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.530
I'm summoning tin goldfish!

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.660
And now I can summon
a twin of my tin!

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.590
Cause once I summon one tin
goldfish, I can play another one

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.260
right away!

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.160
Here's tin goldfish number two!

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.230
Bronk is trying to use
quattro's strategy against him.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.790
Go for it!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.660
Now I'll take my tin goldfish
and aye-Iron, and overlay them!

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.730
Now I can build
the overlay network,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.190
and that means I can xyz summon!

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.460
So say hello to tin archduke!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.360
Excellent!

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.460
You're a lot quicker on the
draw than I expected, bronk.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.360
That was just the
warm-Up act quattro!

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.060
Since Tin archduke is an xyz
monster, colosseum's effect

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.260
makes it stronger by
two hundred attack points!

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.760
And that's not all,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.790
I activate its special ability!

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.230
Now I can use one overlay Unit
and pull a switcheroo on your

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.860
monster's battle mode!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.360
Oh my, it looks like you've
outmaneuvered me again, bronk.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.860
You certainly
are a talented duelist.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.960
Wow!

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.590
Thanks quattro!

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.930
Nice goin'! the duel just got
started and quattro has praised

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.360
you twice already!

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.490
I'm changing quattro's facedown
monster in defense mode to

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.490
attack mode.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.390
Gentlemen, say hello to my
gimmick puppet Princess.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.760
That monster
has zero attack points.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.490
This is gonna be a breeze.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.990
I can't miss!

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.590
Okay Archduke,

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.160
attack that
gimmick puppet Princess!

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.260
Blade bop!

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.360
I activate the puppet
repair trap card!

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.630
This trap comes in handy when a
puppet monster that's level four

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.660
or lower gets destroyed.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.660
It lets me summon the
same monster from my deck.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.560
So here's another
gimmick Puppet Princess!

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.730
Okay, then I'll just pull the
ol' reverse-O-Rama trick again!

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.260
Use Your special
ability tin archduke!

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.960
By Using an overlay unit, I'll
change your monster's battle

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.790
mode, so now your
puppet's in attack mode!

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.460
Amazing!

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.230
Your monster can actually use
its special ability more than

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.830
once a turn?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.260
This isn't looking good for me.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.630
Oh wow!

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.990
I can hardly believe it!

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.130
I know.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.660
If bronk and Caswell keep up the
pressure, they could pull off an

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.090
upset!

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.430
My turn now!

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.790
I draw!

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.090
Quattro Really messed up!

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.530
This is too easy!

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.130
With No attack points, his
monster's a sitting duck!

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.130
In the end, any attack at all
will pulverize his puppet.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.490
And if I use an attack that's at
least 1600 points, we'll win the

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.030
duel.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.460
I summon debugger
z in Attack mode!

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.090
Here's where the
real fun begins.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.290
Cause if there's a debugger x on
the field when I summon my

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:25.930
debugger Z, then I can
also summon my debugger y!

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.560
Yikes!

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.460
That makes three
level 3 monsters!

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.730
Guess you know what's
coming next, quattro!

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.030
I'm overlaying all
three debuggers,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.630
and now I build the overlay
network and xyz summon!

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.690
Here comes antidote nurse!

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.530
And Now,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.490
thanks to the colosseum field
spell, antidote nurse gets a

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.730
booster of two
hundred attack points!

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.790
Just what the doctor ordered.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.060
Get that Princess,
antidote nurse.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.260
Oh no,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.160
what am I going to do?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.390
Oh yeah!

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.320
They won!

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.190
Great Teamwork, Caswell!

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.430
All right!

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.860
We beat quattro!

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.360
My congratulations.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.590
Your attacks have
been truly amusing.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.260
But they were hardly
enough to defeat me.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.760
Hold on,

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.990
Caswell destroyed his monster.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.460
Interesting.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.160
Yeah, how did you survive?

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.830
I simply activated my gimmick
box trap as soon as you

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.230
attacked.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.190
Not only don't I take any damage
from your attack, but this trap

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.690
card then transforms
into a monster card.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.690
And that's not the only
surprise I have in store.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.230
Remember the amount of
damage I would have taken?

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.190
That becomes my monster's
attack points instead.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.190
You should forget about
this duel, brother.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.360
It's clear they don't
have any number cards.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.960
Or else They would have
used them already.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.660
Number cards?

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.060
I see!

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.130
Quattro and his brother
must be number hunters!

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.530
Now my friends, since I can't
take any numbers from you, I'll

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.160
enjoy watching
you squirm instead.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.790
Say what?

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.630
What does that mean?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.290
How many times do I have to tell
you I love spoiling my fans?

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.990
And when I say spoiled,
I mean really spoiled!

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.160
You're finished!

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.230
I have to admit you
two are pretty good,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.330
better than most of
the chumps I've faced.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.390
Unfortunately, your dueling
skills are still far below mine.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.160
Even working together, you're
not good enough to beat me!

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.360
Gimmick puppet
Scarecrow, come out!

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.530
Next I activate the spell
card level doubler!

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.730
Now I can send one of the cards
in my hand to the graveyard to

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.630
double my puppet
scarecrow's level from 4 to 8!

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.490
Are you feeling
the thrill yet?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.990
And now it's time
to end this duel.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.960
I overlay level 8 gimmick box
and gimmick puppet scarecrow in

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.690
order to build
the overlay network!

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.590
I xyz summon number 15:
Gimmick puppet giant grinder.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.830
He really is a number Hunter.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.230
There's more.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.390
Don't forget xyz Colosseum gives
my giant two hundred more attack

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.560
points.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.830
And then my giant can
activate its special ability.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.230
By using an overlay unit, it can
target the xyz monsters you

00:15:54.230 --> 00:16:02.590
activated and destroy them!

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.260
Your nightmare is just beginning
though, because the attack

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.090
points of the destroyed Monster
are then dealt to you as damage!

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.630
Damage?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.960
That's 2400 attack points
coming your way.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.260
This duel's been
fun, you fools.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.910
Fire away!

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.160
This duel's been
fun, you fools!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.230
Oh No, bronk!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.830
You're next, small fry!

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.560
Sorry I have to destroy
your antidote nurse.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.030
But don't worry, all her power
will be coming right back at

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.290
you! Blast away!

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.460
I won't be happy until all my
fans get exactly what they

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.430
deserve.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.790
You two twerps are going
down with a big bang!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.130
I activate my two gimmick puppet
Princess' special abilities from

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.730
my graveyard.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.930
I banish them to summon two
monsters from your graveyards

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.790
back to your fields.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.430
First up, tin archduke.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.260
He's going after
their monsters again!

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.790
And Because my colosseum's
effect will increase tin

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.530
archduke's attack points,
there's even more power I can

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.190
turn against you.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.560
Of course!

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.430
Quattro has set up a
perfect attack loop!

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.960
Wait, what do you mean?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.230
He can use their monsters
against them again?

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.590
Correct.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.130
Your friends are helpless.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.360
My fans are no different from
the puppet monsters contained in

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.890
my deck.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.460
They're helpless to resist my
will, and I'm pulling all the

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.230
strings!

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.060
Once Again my giant will
destroy your feeble monsters,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.260
and end this duel!

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.630
Quattro Set this trap up from
the beginning of the match.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.160
He tricked bronk and Caswell
into Choosing monsters that he

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.960
could use against them.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.830
His strategy is devious,
but quite effective.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.660
They've lost.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.690
It's not over yet.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.860
I still have a lot
more spoiling to do.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.160
Go giant grinder!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.290
Hold on, your duel is over!

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.060
Sorry, but this duel isn't
finished until I decide it is!

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.060
Now giant grinder,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.830
final dance!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.660
Guys!

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.330
this is horrible.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.690
Come on, you guys.
Wake up. Wake up!

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.830
This is not good.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.430
Everything's going
to be okay, bronk.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.460
But what about... Caswell?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.760
Please hang on.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.190
You maniac!

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.590
They looked up to you!

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.790
Why did you do this to them?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.860
Let's just say that I
find it highly entertaining.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.560
That does it!

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.460
Quattro, I'm
challenging you now!

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.890
Get ready to duel!

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.830
Does this mean you've
become a fan, too?

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.830
SHARK: Hello quattro.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.160
What's shark doing here?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.790
You were hard to find.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.060
But now that I've
hunted you down quattro,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.790
let's duel!
