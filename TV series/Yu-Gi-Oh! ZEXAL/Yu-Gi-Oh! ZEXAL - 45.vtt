WEBVTT

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.030
Mr. Heartland: You two want to
join the world duel carnival?

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.360
Nistro: That's right, we
want a piece of the action!

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.890
If you let us enter,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.660
you won't be sorry.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.190
You'd have to resign from
the organizing committee.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.860
But if that's what
you really want.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.890
It is Mr. Heartland.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.690
Ok then, but if you enter,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.690
I expect you to make it all
the way through to the finals.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.660
Is that understood nistro?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.990
Yes Mr. Heartland.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.890
You don't have
to worry about that.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.860
I have my sites
set on someone.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.430

DEXTRA: You're going
after yuma Tsukumo?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.790
Yeah.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.230
Remember, he is the one
who is playing host to...

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.090
the original number!

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.730
We'll need to devise a plan.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.430
I don't need one.
Not with a deck like mine.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.630
Hold on.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.590
What about the deck Mr.
Heartland gave to you?

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.790
You have to duel with that one.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.360
I thought about using it, but

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.560
I'm not really feelin' it.
My deck's way better anyway.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.830
And I'll prove it,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.160
by taking down yuma and
the original number.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.690
Before anyone else
even gets the chance.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
When you're as good as me,
you don't worry about plans.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.790
What's with the serious
look on your face?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.530
You do realize we each have to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.990
win all five heart
pieces in just one day.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.660
My kind of odds dextra.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.760
My kind of odds.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.160
Yuma: What?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.830
Roku went back to
the duel sanctuary?

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.560
I thought he was gonna
stick around and watch me duel.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.030
Grandma: He forgot
an old student of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.990
his was visiting today.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.230
But he did say he's proud of
your decision to continue down

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.660
the path of the duelist.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.860
I just hope I
have what it takes.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.860
Kari: Quit it with the
self doubt already.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.830
You're in the world
duel carnival now!

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.930
So stop worrying
and start winning.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.630
You mean it, sis?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.290
Lillybot: Yuma.
You must eat.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.530
You must eat.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.790
Duel fuel!

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.030
Duel fuel!

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.190
Sweet!

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.390
I'm starvin'!

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.730
thanks a lot, lillybot!

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.690
Now go out there
and high five the sky!

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.590
Impossible.
Yuma has no vertical.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.460
Yuma has no vertical.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.790
Lillybot, you talk more smack
about me than my opponents!

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.560
See you guys later!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.590
Tori: Hey yuma, how's it going?

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.360
Wow, what's up guys?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.290
Caswell!

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.660
You're outta bed!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.960
How're you doing?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.560
You all better?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.930
Caswell: Kinda. I'm not a 100%
yet, but you know, a tough guy

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.130
like me can't be
kept down for too long.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.360
No sir.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.060
No one pushes me around.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.590
Flip: Yuma! We're all here to
cheer you on in the carnival!

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.790
KAT: And watch you
pounce the competition!

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.330
You guys rule!

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.960
Bronk: You know, he's a lot
stronger than he looks.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.460
It's the last day of the world
duel carnival preliminary rounds

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.490
and time is running out!

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.690
If you want to be a part of the
finals, hurry up and win your

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.560
five heart pieces!

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.790
Now get out there and duel!

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.230
I've run the numbers
yuma and in the end,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.890
you have a great shot
at making the finals.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.330
The finals?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.660
That's nuthin'.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.890
I plan on winning
the entire carnival!

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.560
Cause I'm feeling the...

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.230
what's up, yuma?

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.130
I was just remembering my Dad
would always tell me to simply

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.460
become who I wanted to be.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.760
Astral: Well yuma it seems that
you are certainly honoring

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.560
your father's words.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.690
You set out to be a
world champion duelist.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.360
And it appears your goal
is well within your grasp.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.590
Hey, so how many heart
pieces did you collect so far?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.190
You need five for the finals.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.430
Uh-huh.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.730
That's right!

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.230
And I've got these
four pieces already.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.390
Nice!

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.760
One more and you'll move on!

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.990
Time's a tickin guys!

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.490
Yuma Needs his
final heart piece,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490
so we better find him
a duelist to battle!

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.360
Yea, like a really
rotten one with no ability!

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.830
But there's probably
no rotten ones left.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.260
Then we'll just hafta'
settle for a crummy one.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.890
Yeah, a crummy one!

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.890
Thanks for your
support. I guess...

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.090
Let me see here,
a real crummy duelist.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.290
Yuma needs all
the help he can get,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.830
so we gotta find
him an easy win!

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.560
That's right!

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.260
Let's all work to find yuma
a duelist that he can beat!

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.790
And this time, no catnapping.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.630
I bet there's a really terrible
duelist hiding out in these back

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.430
alleys, just hoping
not to get discovered.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.990
Well, I'll flip their plan
on them and tell yuma...

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.030
it's n-Nistro!

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.930
Dextra too?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.560
I picked the wrong alley.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.190
How did you do?

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.530
I was hoping getting these three

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.290
heart Pieces
would be a challenge.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.760
Me too.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.290
Quitting the carnival's
organizing committee

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.690
was the right move.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.260
We'll have a full
set of heart pieces to

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.460
enter the finals in no time.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.890
they entered the carnival!

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.460
Sparrow: And now,
to finish you off!

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.960
Esper Star Sparrow!

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.460
Attack with...

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.830
mega-Punch surprise!

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.460
As I promised,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.030
I shall now resume autographing!

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.960
Girls: This is the
best day of my life!

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.630
I can't believe it's him!

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.930
Everyone Please calm
down and form a line, ok?

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.330
I promise to sign all of your...

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.490
hey you in the costume!

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.830
You look like a duelist who
might have a heart piece he's

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.130
willing to part ways with.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.430
A heart piece?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.830
I'm guessing you're in
the world duel carnival?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.630
That's right and if you've got a
heart piece to help complete my

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.160
set, I'm gonna win it from ya.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.830
I'm afraid...

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.390
I must disagree with you.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.760
It is your heart piece that
will help me complete my set.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.260
You see I need my fourth heart
piece, and yours will do Nicely.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.160
Oh, I'm sure it would.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.290
But you don't look like
someone who could win it.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.790
Don't get cocky.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.530
He has won three
heart pieces after all.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.030
When you're the best,
you get to be cocky.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.190
Whoa!

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.460
The Sparrow!

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.730
So much for me
finding a crummy duelist.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.860
Bring it on, bird boy!

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.390
Duel disk set.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.330
Get ready to feel the heat!

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.590
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.590
Together: Let's duel!

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.960
Flip!

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.390
You made it.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.790
Thanks for calling
us about this duel!

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.060
SUMMER: Tori!

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.590
What are you two doing here?

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.330
Jen: We wanted a really good
view of the Sparrow's duel.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.760
And of the Sparrow!

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.890
He's super hot!

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.830
Sparrow?

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.490
I'm not a hero.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.890
I'm just an average

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.990
middle-School kid
from the 'burbs.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.530
It is nice to meet you.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.630
My name is Nelson.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.190
Why's Nelson dueling
in his Sparrow getup?

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.090
And now fiend, I summon
the mighty and powerful

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.530
ironhammer the giant,
in defense mode!

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.660
Whoa!

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.290
Sparrow, I mean
Nelson's field is already

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.760
full of mind blowing monsters!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.160
Indeed.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.360
He has quite the
formidable foursome!

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.330
Recalling our own fierce duel
with the Sparrow reminds me what

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.260
an honor it was to face
such an exemplary duelist.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.460
Sparrow!

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.930
Yuma...

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.030
Hey you guys, you gotta check
out what nistro's playing!

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.830
Wow, he's got some
powerful monsters too!

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.190
They may give Sparrow's, I mean
Nelson's, a run for their money.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.660
Yeah, nistro's brutal!

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.160
He even quit the
carnival's organizing

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.990
committee to be able to battle!

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.390
Hey, yuma!

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.030
I'm coming for you
so watch your back!

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.290
What?

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.590
Why did he just call me out?

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.430
And why are his
monsters totally different

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.330
than when he took me on?

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.060
Perhaps he has optimized
his deck for the carnival.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.590
However, currently the Sparrow's
monsters have the upper hand.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.290
Esper star Sparrow,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.560
attack heroic
challenger-Spartan directly!

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.560
Please,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.390
that move is for the birds!

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.160
I activate my
spartan's special ability!

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.360
Heroic formation!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.490
When my monster is attacked, its
special ability allows all the

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.230
spartans to combine
their attack points.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.030
Oh no, the Sparrow's
goose is cooked!

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.490
Unless your friend the Sparrow
has a trick up his sleeve.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.030
So clever.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.230
But not as clever
as this I'm afraid!

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.790
I activate my trap
change to jet iron!

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.030
Now I tribute the Sparrow family
so that I can summon the truly

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.260
incredible dimensional jet iron!

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.360
And its attack points equal the
total attack points of the

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.390
monsters that were tributed.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.130
Arise, dimensional jet iron!

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.160
That monster is
the cat's meow!

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.260
And now, dimensional jet iron!

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.130
Attack With Iron Phoenix!

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.560
I'm activating my trap Card

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.990
heroic guard!

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.960
With the power of this trap, by
tributing one spartan, I can

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.660
then decrease the damage I
take by its attack points.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.290
And here's another trap for you.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.260
Heroic retribution sword!

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.390
I can activate this trap when a
heroic challenger is destroyed.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.060
If the monster equipped with
This sword battles your monster

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.830
that destroyed heroic
challenger, your monster is

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.630
automatically destroyed, and you

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.590
take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.660
Peck on that bird boy!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.390
That's 8000 points of
damage for the Sparrow!

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.190
This is quite the comeback.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.760
Not on my watch!

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.790
I activate dimensional
jet Iron's special ability!

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.960
I tribute it to bring back the

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.390
Sparrow family
from my graveyard.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.390
Lucky for you, since
dimensional jet Iron is gone,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.760
my sword's effect ends.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.330
Never thought the first
challenge I've had all day

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.490
would be dressed like that!

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.430
I refuse to stoop to your level.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.830
But suffice it to say that you

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.790
too have proven
to be a worthy foe.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.760
However, we must get
back to the duel at hand.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.530
For now, by summoning gairuda,
I draw one card and end my turn.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.290
Yes!

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.260
This... this... is the most
insane, totally nuts duel ever!

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.330
My dueling Fever
is through the roof!

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.630
I can't wait to get
out there and battle!

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.990
It's payback time
you feathered freak!

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.360
My spartan wants me to get
revenge for its fallen brothers.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.160
In order to do that, I draw!

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.030
I tribute my
spartan to summon...

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.990
Heroic challenger war hammer!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.030
And now,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.930
attack beast Warrior Puma!

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.560
Whoa!

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.490
That was some hit!

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.860
Puma!

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.630
Awww, poor Kitty cat.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.160
Looks like that's one cat
that didn't have nine lives.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.460
Very funny.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.030
It gets funnier!

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.660
I activate warhammer's
special ability!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.160
War Hammer equips the monster it

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.790
destroyed and gains
its attack points!

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.990
You see that?

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.590
With just one card, nistro
doubled his advantage!

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.830
That was a remarkable strategy!

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.830
Puma's attack points
will not save you!

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.860
Well they sure aren't
gonna hurt to have!

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.830
Now, I end my turn
with a facedown!

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.130
Not good 'cause the
s on

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.390
weak to take on nistro's
wicked war hammer!

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.760
You're right.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.330
Things don't look
too good, bronk!

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.360
But somethin' tells me
we ain't seen nuthin' yet.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.290
what am I to do?

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.690
focus!

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.130
turn things around.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.590
what would yuma do?

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.390
when we dueled, I had him beat,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.660
but he never stopped
believing in himself.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.630
that's what "I" need to do now.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.860
My turn!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.990
I draw!

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.290
I activate the spell
card galaxy queen's light!

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.130
With this card, I can select any
monster on my field, and all

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.660
other monsters will have the
same level as the monster I

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.260
chose until the end of my turn!

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.130
Unfortunately for you I choose
my level 10 esper star Sparrow!

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.690
Galaxy Queen's light, shower my
field with your celestial power!

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.130
I overlay my 3 Level
10 monsters in order to

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.090
build the overlay network!

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.060
Now the power of the Sparrow
family will join forces so that

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.560
I can xyz summon

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.060
superdimensional
robot galaxy destroyer!

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.060
Prepare to be blasted
out of this world!

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.390
5000 attack points!

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.830
Whoa the Sparrow...

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.660
I mean Nelson, has really
stepped up his game!

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.260
Yes, quite so!

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.930
I wish I knew why Nelson
is dueling as the Sparrow.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.030
I thought he was
through with that!

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.630
well, Well, well,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.960
maybe I underestimated
the little bird boy.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.260
or maybe, once I
flip over that card,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.490
he'll find that he
underestimated me!

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.860
i have seen this
technique before.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.390
nistro likely played the
trap card sakuretsu armor.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.660
which means, the moment the
sparrow's monster attacks,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.190
it instantly gets destroyed.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.430
I activate galaxy
destroyer's special ability!

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.230
By Using one overlay unit,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.530
all the spell and trap cards
on your field are destroyed!

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.390
Go galaxy break!

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.360
What?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.630
Awesome!

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.130
War Hammer's attack points are

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.530
back to where they're
supposed to be!

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.230
And now, superdimensional
robot galaxy destroyer,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.960
attack war hammer!

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.030
If this maneuver works out,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.230
nistro's going
down for the count!

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.660
Not so fast you
costumed crackpot!

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.060
I send heroic Challenger

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.360
swordshield from my
hand to the graveyard.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.090
When I do that, if there's 2000

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:02.030
or more points of damage
dealt to me in battle...

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.060
the battle damage is negated,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.390
and my life Points become 100.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.260
No way!

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.130
Nistro just
survived the attack!

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.290
I would have won the duel
if you didn't make that move!

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.860
Guess my victory is
going to have to wait.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.530
Even though the Sparrow didn't
win there, nistro's down to his

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.690
last hundred life points!

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.760
Now for my comeback!

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.690
I summon heroic
challenger double Lance!

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.130
and it'll have you seeing
double, because this one counts

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.890
as two monsters
when xyz summoning!

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.260
Can it be?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.630
So that means...

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.590
that means I overlay
two level 4 double lances!

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.690
With These two monsters,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.960
I build the overlay
network and xyz summon

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.330
heroic champion excalibur!

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.060
It seems this duel has
taken a most wicked turn!

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.490
Now things are going to get
worse for you because I'm

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.790
activating excalibur's
special ability!

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.560
By Using one overlay unit, I
can double its attack points!

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.430
4000 attack points!

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.890
Just like that!

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.130
But Sparrow's monster has 5000!

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.130
Nistro's monster
still cannot beat it.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.460
Now I'll really ruffle your
feathers, when I activate the

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.560
spell card heroic chance,

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.760
and excalibur's attack
points are doubled again!

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.830
It's got 8000 attack points!

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.160
And Now nistro can beat Sparrow!

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.190
Heroic champion excalibur,

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.730
attack galaxy destroyer!

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.730
Go Shark sword slash!

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.860
Impossible!

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.060
How can this be?

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.830
Oh no, Sparrow.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.530
He lost, no way!

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.260
My wings were clipped.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.290
Sparrow!

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:52.030
Now now yuma, you
know my name is Nelson.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.330
Of course it is, but why'd
you duel as the Sparrow?

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.960
All part of my strategy.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.290
I thought it might psych my
opponents out if they were

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.590
facing a famous, super
powerful hero like the Sparrow.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.460
I see.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.930
Not bad, not bad at all.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.460
Right back at you. Guess
you earned my heart piece.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.760
Nistro.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.930
You quit the carnival
committee to duel?

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.290
That's right!

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.090
I needed a piece
of the action.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.530
Seriously?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.360
Be sure to make
the finals yuma.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.560
I'll be waiting.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.230
Don't let him get to you.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.530
You know, you're the reason I
was able to go the distance!

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.230
Remember our duel?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.130
I had you on the ropes but
you just wouldn't give up.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.660
Hey guys!

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.190
I was just telling yuma that it
was his spirit that inspired me

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.330
to duel against all
odds with nistro.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.760
Whoa, I really
inspired a hero?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.260
I may play a hero on television
But your relentless spirit in a

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.990
duel makes you my
real life hero, yuma.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.230
Whoa the Sparrow
is a tv superhero,

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.790
with bazillions of adoring fans.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.360
But if I'm his hero,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.790
then that means all his
fans are actually mine!

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.290
oh yuma...
