WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.760
Yuma: Last time on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.730
BRONK: Is shark gonna be okay?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.860
Caswell: The doctor says
there's nothing wrong

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.930
with him physically.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.190
Cathy: Why doesn't
he wake up then?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.090
Because

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.390
shark's soul has been stolen.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.260
When that number Hunter Kite
wins a duel, he takes the

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.030
loser's number and their soul.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.460
He stole something
else this time, too.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.290
My golden key.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.230
Mr. Kay: You want me
to track down a Crook?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.590
We're counting on you, Mr. Kay!

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.990
All you have to do is upload a
virus into the datanet and find

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.330
the computer he's using.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.990
Which should lead us
directly to Kite's

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.930
and to yuma's key!

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.790
CRASHBUG: Crashbug!

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.490
KITE: Yuma's pendant has opened
up a portal, and I bet it's a

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.630
portal to astral world!

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.730
Orbital 7: Master?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.190
What is that?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.490
The virus has detected something

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.460
the data-Stream leads
to a warehouse that's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.530
owned by Mr.Heartland.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.630
That's where my golden key is!

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.760
TORI: Yuma!

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.730
You must be the visitor
from, astral world.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.830
I'm going to need you to hand
over the numbers you've

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590
collected with yuma!

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.260
ASTRAL: If I did that, I would
never regain my memories.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.390
Then I'll have to
get them another way.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760
Let's duel!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.160
Photon Leo, stick it
to gogogo giant!

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.360
CRASHBUGS: Crashbug!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.090
Uh-Oh we're being hacked!

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330
It's too late!

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.190
The whole system is crashing!

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.930
ANNOUNCEMENT: Security breach
in sector three.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.130
security breach in sector three

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.130
it's yuma!

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.590
How did they get in here!?

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.730
you know you're going to lose.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.660
Call it quits and give
me all your numbers.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.130
No, I will not quit.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.960

Astral, where are you!?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.090
Hang on astral, I'm on the way!

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.090
I've got to stop yuma before
this spins out of control!

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.330
Better Call for backup!

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.090
Calling orbitals five and six!

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.560
Bash Those brats!

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.860
Guess we can't go this way.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.360
Or that way!

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.960
This welcoming party
doesn't look too friendly.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.530
Get outta here yuma!

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.160
We'll keep these 'bots busy so
you can g scue astral!

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.190
But bronk

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.860
Hey, blockhead!

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.960
CATHY: You sure gave that
bot the boot, Caswell!

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.090
Go ahead yuma, we'll handle 'em!

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.190
Now go get your key!

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.590
Thanks you guys.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.130
Take that you big bug!

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.690
When we run out of
shoes, we'll sock ya!

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.790
KITE: Those life points are
running out quickly

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.860
my foolish friend.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.360
Your time is almost up!

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.730
I place a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.730
Hesitating?

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.790
Why bother you'll lose
no matter what you do.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.930
We shall see!

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.390
I draw!

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.230
none of my defensive Moves
have worked against Kite.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.530
I wonder What yuma
would do now?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.790
No!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.130
Let me!

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.230
Quick!

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.860
Ow!

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.230
They're still loose!?

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.290
Okay

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.030
no more Mr. Nice 'bot!

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.990
I'm waiting.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.330
Are you going to make
a move or not!?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.360
I know exactly what yuma
would do in this duel.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.530
I must feel the flow!

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.530
I summon zubaba Knight!

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.960
Zubaba KNIGHT: Zubaba Knight!

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.460
Next I send this
card to the graveyard to

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.090
summon acorno!

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.930
And then I'll activate the
spell card drop exchange!

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.260
Now if I send two or more
monsters to my graveyard, I can

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.960
summon a monster from
my hand whose level is

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.690
equal to their total!

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.530
So by sending level 3
zubaba Knight and level 1

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.530
acorno to my graveyard

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.560
I can bring out kagetokage!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.490
As you see I now have two level
four monsters on my field.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.260
I hope you're about to do
what I think you are.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.730
I overlay gogogo golem and
kagetokage in order to build the

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.930
overlay network and xyz summon,
number 39: Utopia!

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.490
Not more firewalls!

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.390
I can't Hack this
security system!!!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.460
that looks like Kite.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.630
Except he seems a lot happier.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.160
Who's that other kid?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.260
DOOR: Yuma tsukumo, have
you the courage?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.760
Courage for what?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.530
Enter the door and you shall
gain New power beyond anything

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.760
you imagine, but to balance this
power, you must sacrifice that

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.530
which is most important to you.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.030
There is one who stands
in your way, however.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.690
Use your skill to
defeat this threat.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.090
Now if you dare,
enter this door.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.230
Enter and obtain the
power of zexal!

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.690
The power of zexal?

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.590
Your utopia - Will soon be mine!

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.490
You are greatly mistaken.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.190
Utopia attack photon Leo
with Rising SUN slash

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.460
nice try, but your
plan won't work.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.490
Because I have the
trap card armored back!

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.360
Know what it does?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.360
It lets me bring back the
monster you just destroyed.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.960
So welcome back to
the duel, photon Leo!

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.160
He needs two monsters with at
least 2000 attack points, so

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.490
that he can tribute them and

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.290
summon galaxy-Eyes
photon Dragon.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.190
I must be ready!

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.390
I end my turn.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.060
Zexal

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.260
hold it right there, pipsqueak!

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.290
Surrender Now

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.260
or feel my fury!

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
You're that mini mech.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.430
I am orbital 7!

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.090
And when I get angry,
I have a huge temper!

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.190
Who's mini now?!

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.360
little pest!

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.360
This is how we deal
with trespassers!

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.860
I got carried away.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.890
Aw, can't get unstuck.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.330
Help me out here, pal!

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.430
We'll call a truce.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.690
Hey stop!

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.690
My draw!

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.490
I play photon circle!

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.360
That monster only
has 1000 attack points.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.430
There are not enough
points to summon galaxy-Eyes.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.860
That's what you think!

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.030
I activate the effect of my
equip spell photon Spear.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.660
Now when a monster equipped with
photon Spear is tributed to

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.330
summon another monster,
it counts as two!

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.330
As two!?

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.360
know what that means?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.860
It means trouble!

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.660
I summon galaxy-Eyes
photon Dragon!

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.760
Go galaxy-Eyes,
blast utopia with photon

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.490
stream of destruction!

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.760
And now I activate
its special ability!

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.260
Say so-long, 'cause that means
monsters are now banished!

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.290
And that leaves
you totally vulnerable!

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.390
Okay photon circle, you're up!

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.030
Attack him directly!

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.590
Now that I'm done
attacking, galaxy-Eyes and

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.660
utopia return to the field.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.060
But your nightmare isn't over,
because thanks to galaxy-Eyes'

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.390
special ability, it absorbs
utopia's overlay units.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.360
And it gains 500 attack
points for each one!

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.230
4000 attack points!

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.790
And next I'm activating the
spell galaxy storm!

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.790
This card lets me
obliterate one xyz monster that

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.890
has no overlay units.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.230
Utopia's gone!

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.690
I activate, xyz reflect!

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.460
When an xyz monster is
threatened by an effect, this

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.390
trap card negates that effect
and strikes at you with 800

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.360
points of damage!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.830
Impressive.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.060
But not impressive enough.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.130
You forgot something.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.260
Your utopia is powerless
against my galaxy-Eyes.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.530
Perhaps so.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.490
But you may be in for an
unpleasant surprise!

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.260
Once again I draw!

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.560
Now you will see

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.730
utopia's True form!

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.460
Since I have less than 1000 life
points, I can draw on utopia and

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.060
call Forth Chaos number 39:
Utopia ray!

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.030
Go Chaos xyz evolution!

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.490
No way, a chaos number!?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.930
I had no idea numbers
have this power.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.890
But it's too bad for
you it has less attack

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.930
points than my galaxy-Eyes!

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.360
That does not matter.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.630
It has yet another target!

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.660
Utopia Ray, wield
your special ability!

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.890
Watch as it gains
500 attack points by

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.690
using One overlay unit!

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.830
Go Overlay charge!

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.860
And Now, your photon circle
loses 1000 attack points.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
It is time, utopia ray!

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:02.030
Destroy photon circle with
Rising SUN chaos slash!

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.060
It is over.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.130
But I thought

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.860
that you had beaten me?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.860
When you attacked my photon
circle I only took half the

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.660
damage I was supposed to take
because of its special ability!

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.790
He seems nearly indestructible!

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.960
I am placing one card facedown
and ending my turn.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.790
It looks like
you're in trouble now.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.290
Watch out!

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.030
I draw!

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.390
Prepare to suffer the rage of
galaxy-Eyes and its photon

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.160
stream of destruction!

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.490
I activate the trap card Clean
Barrier - Clear force!

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.930
This card "clears" Your
attacking monster of its

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.530
power-Ups and restores
galaxy-Eyes to its original

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.630
attack points,
reducing the damage I take.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.790
This is one duel you will
not win, number Hunter!

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.260
No matter what attack
you throw I will block you.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.760
You're still in this duel.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.990
But not for long with
only 400 life points!

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.090
One more attack
and you'll be finished

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.530
and your numbers will
finally be mine!

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.160
Yuma

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.990
my golden key!

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.660
I hope astral's okay

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.260
I am almost out of life points

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.090
and out of time.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.290
Farewell, yuma.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.230
I am glad to have known you

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.860
what is happening to me?

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.430
Something must be
goin' on inside the key!

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.860
Listen astral!

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.060
I'm here to help!

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.230
Astral!

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.560
You there, astral?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.790
Gimme a sign!

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.690
Here, again?

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.330
It has come.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.790
The time for you to decide

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.660
enter the door and gain the new
power that is your destiny!

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.260
But remember, the power will
only be granted if you sacrifice

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.990
that which you hold most dear.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.860
Are you ready for the challenge?

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.090
Astral!

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.160
Yuma!

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.760
Yuma, is that you?

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.760
That's right.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.560
I sensed that you
might need help.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.590
You're dueling
against Kite, aren't you?

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.230
Yes, yuma.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.460
But I fear it is
too late For help.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.290
My life points are running out.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.330
No!

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.360
Just hang on!

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.130
I'm comin' to help ya, astral!

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.160
Stay there, yuma!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.190
This world is very
different from yours.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.190
I am not sure it is
safe for you here.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.030
In any case, this
fight is mine alone!

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.590
That's not True.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.490
You can't go it alone!

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.530
Astral, listen!

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.690
Don't you see?

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.190
We both need each other!

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.990
It's zexal!

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.190
Zexal is the power I need.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.830
Once I get that power
I can help you.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.130
What do you know about zexal?

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.330
Nothing really.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.260
Just what the door told me.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.930
Zexal is a miraculous
power that will save my world.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.890
I will get the power, I promise!

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.360
I'll do whatever it takes to
save you, because we're a team!

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.560
Together We're gonna
high-Five the sky!

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.630
It is my turn!

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:08.160
I will now build the overlay
network with my friend yuma!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.190
Two Mighty forces
will fuse into one

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.830
revealing the power of zexal!

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.460
Now yuma!

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.190
Let's feel the flow!

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.460
Zexal morph!

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960
What's going on?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.990
What is that?

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.760
What the huh!?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.730
what's with the getup!?

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.790
when two distant
souls become one

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.190
the power of zexal is revealed!

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.230
Wait a minute

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.460
that's yuma!

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.490
Somehow He got jumbled
up with the other one!

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.160
But, even combined you
only have 400 life points!

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.260
Are you sure it's that few!?

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.790
we can win this, yuma.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.060
It all depends on
this next card!

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.290
You must tap into your heart
during this draw,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.060
believe in your cards.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.430
It is the only way you can pick
the one we need right now.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.460
Focus, yuma!

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.230
Alright!

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.190
Ready astral?

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.260
By the power of zexal, give me
the wisdom and skill to draw the

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.030
perfect card and
defeat my opponent!

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.230
Go Shining draw!

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.190
Appear, zexal
weapon - Unicorn Spear!

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.930
And now that utopia ray's
equipped with unicorn Spear,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.830
we're gonna gallop to victory!

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.730
With An extra 1900 attack points
utopia ray is more powerful than

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.960
your galaxy-Eyes photon Dragon!

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.690
You still can't defeat me.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.060
When utopia ray is in possession
of a unicorn Spear

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.190
it negates your monster's
ability to flee the field.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.630
There will be no escape
for your galaxy-Eyes!

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.830
Go!

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.130
Unicorn strike!

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.630
I play photon shock!

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.490
The power of this
trap activates when you

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.190
attack my photon monster.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.630
As a result, we both take the
same amount of damage.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.690
A draw!

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.290
That means you can't take my
numbers or my soul, Kite.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.090
All this trouble for nothing.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.230
Why do you even
hunt numbers anyway?

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.660
Well, answer me!

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.030
I do it because it's
the only way I can

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.130
save my little brother.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.760
Brother?

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.060
The kid I saw before

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.230
but why do you need
numbers to help your brother?

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.630
Shark can have this back.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.730
His soul!

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.190
You're really returning it?

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.860
Finally awake, huh?

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.430
SHARK: What's going on?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.660
You've been asleep
a long time, shark.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.160
But I think yuma
just woke you up.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.560
Yuma?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.560
That virus is melting
down all our systems!

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.260
And now I'm having
a meltdown too!

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.260
Is everybody alright?

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.530
Yeah, but it sounds like we
don't have much time!

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.530
We better go!

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.690
Right!

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.090
What about yuma?

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.890
Yuma will find a way out!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.030
I know it!

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.190
Yuma!

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.460
Yuma!

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.790
Hey, what's goin' on!?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.730
yuma!

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.490
Yuma

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.790
yuma

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.360
So, miss me?

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.990
You have some nerve!

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.490
We were so worried!

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.290
I knew you'd make it!

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.930
I'm invincible!

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.560
Are you hurt!?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.960
not a scratch!

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.590
This isn't over, yuma!

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.460
Kite!
