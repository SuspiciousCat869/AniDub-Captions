WEBVTT

00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:03.480
Aargh, this is bad!

00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:06.113
I've gotta score some more life
points before I reach a field

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:07.247
or I'm toast!

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.814
Come on,
keep it together, Yuma!

00:00:09.847 --> 00:00:11.147
Unfortunately...

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.547
I do not see any traps
or spell cards

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.247
that will allow you
to regain life points.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.447
Then I've gotta
battle someone.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.147
Whoa, whoa!

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.280
Whoa, whoa!

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.313
I said
keep it together!

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:26.480
What do you think I'm trying
to do, Tori?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.413
♪ If life is a game they say
I can't win ♪

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:40.780

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.380
I don't know what your goal in
this tournament is, Vetrix,

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:46.446
but there's no way
I'm letting you duel Kite.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.646
Aww...

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.446
Why do you care so much about
what happens to him?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.613
Because I care about him.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.713
That's why.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:57.346
Well, isn't that precious?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.913
(Mr. Heartland)
Looks like we've got a face
off in the jungle field!

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:02.480
It's Dextra,
a former member of

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:04.513
our own tournament organizing
committee,

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:07.946
and the mysterious young
duelist known as Vetrix!

00:02:07.947 --> 00:02:10.180
Remember, each field
in the Dragon's Den

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.547
has a unique active
field spell.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.747
Let's find out what
the jungle field has--

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.780
Huh?

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:17.647
What happened
to the video feed?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.447
What is the meaning
of this?

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:23.380
It seems we're having
technical difficulties...

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:25.180
Sincerest apologies.

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:27.880
Someone get on this and fix this
immediately!

00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:31.380
(Mr. Heartland)
Not that you'll be able to...

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:34.280
I've made sure that no one will
see this duel...

00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:38.347
(both)
Let's duel!

00:02:40.313 --> 00:02:42.847
You saved up
8,000 life points?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.247
Looks like someone was
a busy bee!

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.613
What are you,
scared of me or something?

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:50.247
I'm not scared at all, Vetrix,
but you should be.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.047
In the jungle field, if you
don't summon or place a monster

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.713
facedown during your turn,

00:02:54.747 --> 00:02:57.513
you take 1,000 points
of damage.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.647
This jungle
will be your end!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.847
Now let's go!

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.947
I draw!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.880
First, I activate the spell
Dance of The Butterspy!

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:12.147
This card grants me the power
to summon both Morpho Butterspy

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.580
and Swallowtail Butterspy
directly from my hand!

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:24.247
Now I overlay Morpho Butterspy
and Swallowtail Butterspy!

00:03:26.347 --> 00:03:30.280
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:33.613
I Xyz Summon Photon
Papilloperative!

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.580
An Xyz already?

00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:43.580
And there is a lot more
where that came from...

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:45.413
Three spell cards
to be exact!

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:49.313
I hope you didn't forget how
dangerous this jungle field

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.847
can be, Vetrix.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.680
With it in play, if you don't
summon a monster or place one

00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:56.680
facedown every turn,
you take damage.

00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:59.480
Yeah, you kinda
mentioned that.

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.580
But what I
haven't mentioned yet

00:04:01.613 --> 00:04:03.980
is that if you don't attack
with your monster,

00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:06.613
Butterfly Charm destroys it.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.713
So then I'll always attack!

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:12.113
Be my guest, 'cause the second
spell is Elimigate.

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:14.813
When a monster, other than
Photon Papilloperative,

00:04:14.847 --> 00:04:16.713
tries to pass through
this gate to attack,

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:19.413
that monster
is instantly destroyed.

00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:21.847
So then there's
nothing I can do!

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.513
That's right, Vetrix.

00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:26.913
Every path in this jungle leads
to damage and destruction.

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:28.947
This isn't fair!

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.913
I'm not done.

00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:31.313
Huh?

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:34.013
I've still got one more spell
on my field to play--

00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:35.780
Butterfly Swarm!

00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:39.047
I have to pay 2,000 life points
in order to activate it...

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:44.680
But once it's activated,

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:46.447
when a monster on the field
is destroyed,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.480
the player controlling that
monster gets slammed for

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.347
1,500 points of damage.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.013
So if I don't summon
a monster on my turn,

00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:55.047
I'll take some
serious damage.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.313
But if I do summon a monster
on my turn,

00:04:57.347 --> 00:05:00.980
that monster gets destroyed
and I still take damage...

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:03.213
With the power of this combo,

00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:06.747
you'll be swallowed up by
the jungle in three turns.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.047
(Dextra)
I promised I would
protect you, Kite,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.147
and that's just
what I'm going to do.

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:17.235
(Dextra)
Kite...

00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:20.835
I will protect you... as I swore
I would so many years ago...

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:30.001
(Mr. Heartland)
Stay strong,
young duelists!

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.368
I know you're battling pain
and fatigue.

00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:35.601
But remember, if you can
survive these exercises,

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.468
you will become part of the
select group of elite duelists

00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.868
who will lead the next
generation!

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:44.235
I activate a trap!

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:49.568
I draw!

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.268
Uh, sir, that's--
Quiet!

00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:58.868
But the aggression settings
have never been tested at this

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:00.635
intensity, if--
I said quiet!

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.001
It seems our Dueling Bot
has lost all control!

00:06:11.035 --> 00:06:13.001
You're not walking
out of that test chamber

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:15.235
unless one of you
wins the duel!

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:23.035
... Dextra!

00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:30.635
No!
I got this!

00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:35.001
Kite...

00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:37.268
I draw!

00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.001
I summon Daybreaker!

00:06:44.668 --> 00:06:46.101
Go, Daybreaker!

00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:47.301
Put an end
to this now!

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.635
Excellent dueling, Kite!

00:06:57.668 --> 00:07:00.401
We'll definitely be keeping
an eye on you.

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:01.735
The rest of you take note.

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:03.935
That is what a duelist
looks like.

00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:05.801
Now back to your dorms.

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:13.968
You were lucky this time that
I was around to save your neck,

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.768
but I won't be
around forever.

00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.401
Never forget that the only
person you can count on

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:19.668
is yourself.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.069
(Dextra)
It's Kite...

00:07:34.102 --> 00:07:35.769
And I think I heard
someone say that kid

00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:37.102
is Kite's little brother.

00:07:38.202 --> 00:07:39.402
Hart, look.

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:41.335
A butterfly came here
to see you.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.035
The other kids say there's
something... different...

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.535
with that kid...

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:56.669
And that everything Kite does,
he does for Hart...

00:07:56.702 --> 00:07:58.302
Seems lonely.

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:01.002
I mean, if he's busy
looking out for Hart,

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:02.835
who's looking out for Kite?

00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:07.902
Just as Kite protects
his little brother,

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:10.835
I swore that I would
protect Kite.

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:13.269
This is something
I do alone.

00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:14.769
For him.

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:18.102
So you've got it in for me
'cause of a schoolgirl crush?

00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:22.202
Dextra, that is the lamest thing
I've ever heard in my life!

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:27.535
Where are we?

00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:32.335
A jungle...

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:33.669
Interesting...

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:40.969
Dextra!

00:08:43.202 --> 00:08:45.069
She's dueling Vetrix...

00:08:45.102 --> 00:08:46.569
This I gotta see!

00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:55.579
Dextra...

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:01.379
(Vetrix)
Hey!

00:09:01.412 --> 00:09:02.312
Yuma!

00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:04.746
Look at how much
my life stinks!

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:06.646
I've been caught in
a deadly combo

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.212
from which
there's no escape!

00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:09.546
A combo?

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.179
Is he talking about the spell
cards on Dextra's field?

00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:17.212
That is correct.

00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:19.179
You see,
Dextra has caught Vetrix

00:09:19.212 --> 00:09:21.346
in an extremely
powerful combo

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:24.012
that not only
destroys all his monsters,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.412
but also deals damage
to him every turn.

00:09:27.446 --> 00:09:29.379
Pretty solid strategy.

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:31.912
But there is a way
to escape it.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.512
Of course there is!

00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:36.679
My turn, I draw!

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:41.279
(Vetrix)
Because of the jungle field,
I have to summon a monster.

00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:44.679
But if I summon it in attack
mode, her combo activates.

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:47.412
So, in that case...

00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:51.179
I summon a monster facedown
in defense mode!

00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:55.579
Then I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:09:55.612 --> 00:09:56.746
Phew!

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:59.312
Lucky I was able to tiptoe
around your scary combo

00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.512
this turn!

00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:02.046
That was pretty clever...

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.812
But I've got news for you.

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:06.412
It's gonna take a lot more
than clever to beat me.

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:08.679
It's my turn!

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:09.512
I draw!

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:14.146
First, I pay 2,000 life points
to keep Butterfly Swarm

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:15.446
on my field!

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.879
Next, I activate
Papilloperative's

00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:21.346
special ability!

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:24.879
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:10:24.912 --> 00:10:28.179
one monster is forced to
switch to attack mode!

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:31.312
Then that monster loses
600 attack points.

00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:39.612
Now Heraldic Beast Aberconway
is in attack mode.

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:42.612
Photon Papilloperative,
attack Vetrix' monster

00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:44.112
with Vivid Swarm!

00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:01.379
And now, Butterfly Swarm
descends on you

00:11:01.412 --> 00:11:03.646
for 1,500 points
of damage!

00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:09.479
Your tournament will
end here, in this jungle!

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:11.746
Wow, that was awesome,
Dextra!

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.946
I place a monster
facedown in defense mode.

00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:18.346
Your move.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.479
Keep talking, Dextra...

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.146
Keep on thinking
you're winning...

00:11:24.046 --> 00:11:26.112
I will not allow you
to harm Kite.

00:11:28.046 --> 00:11:30.646
This isn't just
some schoolgirl crush.

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:33.546
You seem like you're willing to
sacrifice everything for him.

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:37.746
He's really got a special place
in your heart, doesn't he?

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:39.146
Wait, what?

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:40.579
What'd I miss?

00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:42.179
Someone's
in someone's heart?

00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:47.679
Yuma, you're
so thickheaded.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.046
You're right...

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.346
I would sacrifice
everything for him.

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:52.846
But that doesn't matter
right now

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.979
'cause you can't
escape my combo...

00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:57.212
We'll see about that...

00:11:57.246 --> 00:11:58.546
I draw.

00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:01.579
I summon Heraldic Beast
Berners Falcon.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.146
Guess you've
accepted your fate.

00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:08.646
Since you summoned a monster
in attack mode,

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:11.046
the butterfly
charm spell activates!

00:12:14.612 --> 00:12:16.112
Due to the power
of this card,

00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:18.946
Heraldic Beast Berners Falcon
is forced to attack!

00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:22.712
Next, Elimigate's effect
activates!

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:25.912
Your monster is
automatically destroyed!

00:12:32.046 --> 00:12:34.112
And now, because of
Butterfly Swarm,

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:37.479
you take another
1,500 points of damage.

00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:42.512
That was amazing!

00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:45.979
Looks like Dextra really might
be able to take down Vetrix.

00:12:49.146 --> 00:12:50.546
I did it.

00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:52.946
Just one more turn
and Kite will be safe.

00:12:57.212 --> 00:12:59.412
That's--
That's a good one!

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.612
"Kite will be safe"!

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:04.979
You're probably clinging to all
these dumb little memories of

00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:07.146
your precious Kite,
aren't you?

00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:09.179
I look forward
to seeing them.

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.512
Here I go!

00:13:12.546 --> 00:13:15.912
I activate the Advanced
Heraldry Art spell card!

00:13:15.946 --> 00:13:19.079
This allows me to use Heraldic
Beasts in my graveyard

00:13:19.112 --> 00:13:21.046
to Xyz Summon!

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:23.046
So glad you put 'em there!

00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:25.612
You can Xyz Summon with monsters
in your graveyard?

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:32.679
I overlay Aberconway
and Berners Falcon!

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:36.179
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:39.212
and Xyz Summon Number 8:

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:41.612
Heraldic King
Genom Heritage!

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:47.812
Someone's tournament will end
here, but it won't be mine...

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:57.246
Welcome to the beginning
of the end!

00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:06.932
Look at that!

00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:09.198
Vetrix possesses
a Number!

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.898
Well, now that I have
that out on my field...

00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.965
I end my turn.

00:14:15.998 --> 00:14:18.465
You think I'm scared
of a Number Card?

00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:20.565
Better think again.

00:14:20.598 --> 00:14:22.265
I draw!

00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:26.665
This is gonna end now.

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:27.998
Vetrix!

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:30.131
I activate Photon
Papilloperative's

00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:32.298
special ability!

00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:34.231
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:36.598
it forces your monster
into attack mode,

00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:40.265
and that monster loses
600 attack points.

00:14:40.298 --> 00:14:41.765
Mystifying Menace!

00:14:42.998 --> 00:14:45.131
And now
Photon Papilloperative,

00:14:45.165 --> 00:14:47.831
attack Heraldic Beast
Genom Heritage!

00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:49.231
You're finished!

00:14:49.265 --> 00:14:51.098
Go Vivid Swarm!

00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:54.831
(Yuma)
All right!

00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:57.998
If this attack succeeds,
it's lights out for Vetrix!

00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:00.231
Not so fast, little hero!

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:02.465
By using
one Overlay Unit,

00:15:02.498 --> 00:15:04.398
I can choose one of
Genom Heritage's

00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.798
three special abilities!

00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:10.065
And the one I choose lets me
steal your monster's name.

00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:24.065
(Dextra)
What is this?

00:15:24.098 --> 00:15:26.331
My monster has
a new identity.

00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:27.431
What do you think?

00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:31.398
From now on,
my Genom Heritage

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.898
shall be known as Photon
Papilloperative.

00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:39.065
And your little butterfly
loses its name completely...

00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:42.431
... Which means it's no longer
a Papilloperative.

00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:44.965
And you know
what that means.

00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:46.931
This can't be happening.

00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:50.465
Now isn't this the part where
your Elimigate activates?

00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:52.098
Yes, it is!

00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.765
Since your Photon
Papilloperative is now nameless,

00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:56.065
it can't attack...

00:15:56.098 --> 00:15:58.465
And even better,
it's destroyed!

00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:01.498
No!

00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:02.931
He's broken up my combo!

00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:06.498
And now, 'cause of your own
Butterfly Swarm spell,

00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.531
you take 1,500
points of damage!

00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:25.498
How...

00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:28.198
How could I have allowed him
to get through my defenses?

00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:32.698
Oh, wait!

00:16:32.731 --> 00:16:34.898
I almost forgot...

00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:36.098
Your memories.

00:16:36.131 --> 00:16:37.931
I'm going to take them&amp;

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:39.431
... All of them!

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.398
Just like I took Hart's!

00:16:47.998 --> 00:16:49.298
Oh, no...

00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:50.631
Without her memories...

00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:54.665
Dextra,
you can't give up!

00:16:54.698 --> 00:16:56.498
Remember why you're
fighting!

00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:57.998
You're fighting for Kite!

00:17:04.298 --> 00:17:05.465
Kite...

00:17:09.198 --> 00:17:11.598
Yes, I remember...

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:13.298
I have to keep fighting!

00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:15.398
I summon
Moonlit Papillon!

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:22.731
And for my next move,

00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:26.165
I'm flipping over my facedown
card, Blue Mountain Butterspy!

00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:34.065
And now, I overlay
Blue Mountain Butterspy

00:17:34.098 --> 00:17:35.698
and Moonlit Papillon!

00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:40.531
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:44.698
I Xyz Summon
Photon Alexandra Queen!

00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:50.798
All right!

00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:53.265
She's not giving up!

00:17:53.298 --> 00:17:56.731
Photon Alexandra Queen uses
all of its Overlay Units

00:17:56.765 --> 00:18:00.198
to return every monster on
the field back to our hands!

00:18:01.398 --> 00:18:03.198
And for every monster
that we get back,

00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:05.565
we take 500
points of damage!

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.098
What?
She is hoping to tie.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.365
(Dextra)
Go Butterfly Breakdown!

00:18:12.398 --> 00:18:14.731
This will finish us both,

00:18:14.765 --> 00:18:17.898
but surviving this duel
doesn't matter to me!

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:21.165
The only thing that I care
about is stopping you!

00:18:21.198 --> 00:18:23.398
Well, that's too bad,
Dextra,

00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:26.765
because I'm afraid there's
nothing you can do to stop me!

00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:31.565
I activate Heraldry Record!

00:18:31.598 --> 00:18:34.131
This trap negates
any special ability

00:18:34.165 --> 00:18:36.031
that uses Overlay Units!

00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:42.765
No...

00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:43.798
No way...

00:18:47.465 --> 00:18:49.998
Anything else?

00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:51.498
I end...

00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:52.631
... my turn.

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:53.598
Dextra!

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:54.965
You can't give up!

00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:58.965
I'm sorry, Kite...

00:18:58.998 --> 00:19:00.065
I ...

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.698
I failed you...

00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:03.398
That's right,
you failed him.

00:19:03.431 --> 00:19:04.965
Poor little you...

00:19:04.998 --> 00:19:05.965
It's over.

00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:07.831
You've lost.

00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:09.298
It's my turn!

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:10.798
I draw!

00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.498
Time for you
to go to sleep.

00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:13.865
Night, night.

00:19:13.898 --> 00:19:16.465
Photon Papilloperative
will sing you a lullaby

00:19:16.498 --> 00:19:18.965
and attack Photon
Alexandra Queen!

00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:20.965
No!

00:19:20.998 --> 00:19:22.931
Vivid Swarm!

00:19:31.398 --> 00:19:35.531
And now, thanks to
Butterfly Swarm's effect...

00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:37.798
this duel is mine.

00:19:43.631 --> 00:19:44.898
Kite...

00:19:44.931 --> 00:19:46.098
Don't forget me...

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.731
Vetrix!

00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.298
You're next, Yuma...

00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:04.765
Get ready.

00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:08.931
Hey!

00:20:08.965 --> 00:20:09.965
Dextra!

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:15.931
I was just thinking
about someone...

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.498
But who?

00:20:17.531 --> 00:20:20.165
