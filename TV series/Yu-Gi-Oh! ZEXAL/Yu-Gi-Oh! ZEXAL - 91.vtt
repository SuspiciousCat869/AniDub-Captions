WEBVTT

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm late again!

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.372
Why didn't you
wake me up, Astral!

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.575
For one hour, I said,
"Yuma, wake up."

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.544
Well, you should've
said it louder!

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.080
(Bronk)
Make way,
coming through!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.749
(Yuma) Bronk!

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.217
See ya!

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.253
Wait, let me hop on!

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.754
(Bronk)
Uh-oh.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.156
Look out!

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.232
I meant to do that...

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.433
Bronk, are you okay?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.736
(Rio) Now that was a wipeout.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.005
(Bronk) Rio?

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:38.572
How are ya?

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.476
Fine, but looks like you
got a little banged up.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.481
There, how's that?

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.750
Yeah, feels good as new.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.753
Thanks a bunch!

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:56.189

(Tori)
...But the group project
isn't due until next week.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.124
Right, Bronk?

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.493
Bronk?

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.128
Earth to Bronk...

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:08.762
Come in.

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:11.098
They're giving away donuts
in the cafeteria, Bronk.

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:14.735
All you can eat, first
come, first serve.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.403
Nothing!

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.338
Rio!

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.507
Boy, Bronk has
got it, real bad.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:24.511
If you really like Rio so much,
you should just take a chance.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.746
Ask her out.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:26.446
You think so?

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.381
But what if she
doesn't like me?

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.585
My philosophy is, if you don't
ask, then they can't say no.

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.153
That's a really good point!

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.489
I also feel like it
should be pointed out

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.157
that Shark is her brother.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.326
Oh, that's a good point, too!

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.193
That doesn't matter.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.562
All that matters is whether
or not Rio likes Bronk,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.765
and he won't never know
unless he asks her out!

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.333
That's a good point!

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.101
But if you say or
do the wrong thing,

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.537
Shark'll make your
life miserable.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.738
Good point.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.673
(Flip) I got it!

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.742
You're just gonna have to
win Shark's respect, Bronk.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.278
(Caswell)
And how is he
supposed to do that?

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:02.449
(Bronk) Yeah, how?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.055
Well what if... you
beat him in a duel?
That's it!

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.324
I'll duel him!

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.594
If I can manage to
defeat Shark in a duel,

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.097
then, maybe he'll respect me.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.365
And then...

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:18.765
And then...

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.203
On this day, you have
earned my sister's hand.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.439
Thanks!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.183
All right!

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:41.755
I'm gonna challenge
Shark to a duel!

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.156
Bronk, wait a sec.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:47.127
He's a goner.
Totally.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.598
A duel?

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.767
You mean, like, you and me?

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.035
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:57.204
And if I win the
duel, then uh...

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.339
Well, uh, your
sister, is, uh...

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.273
(Shark) Face facts.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.709
You're wasting
your time, Bronk.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.343
Well, but...

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.745
The only guy around here
who even comes close

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.114
to being good enough is Yuma.

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:10.016
So then you're saying...

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.052
You'd only consider Yuma?

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:15.422
Consider him
for what?
For Rio, I guess.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:20.393
So then...
it's Yuma.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.204
I guess, uh...

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.341
Good talking to you, Shark.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.612
The world needs to
know about this!

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.551
And that's when Shark said
to Bronk that only Yuma

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.386
could be Rio's boyfriend!

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.687
Are you sure about all this?

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.190
If I wasn't sure about it,
Ray, I wouldn't have posted

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.492
the entire story on
the front page of my blog

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:55.762
"Flip's Daily Quips" so that
everyone could know about it!

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.665
We were there the whole
time, we heard it all!

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:02.002
Well, uh, good for them!

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:05.071
It's not fair.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:06.740
What's up, Bronk?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.341
What did you wanna talk about?

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.444
Yuma, I'm really frustrated!

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:12.479
Why's that?

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.748
I'm frustrated because
it can't be me,

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.650
and that makes me super bummed.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.053
And super bummed is not fun.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:20.754
But Yuma...

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.757
I know that you and me
are best buds, am I right?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.625
Yeah, Bronk, of course.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.728
That's why I'm gonna try
to be okay with this!

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:31.464
But make Rio cry, and
we're gonna have words!

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.500
Wait, what are you
talking about?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.738
Shark said the only guy good
enough for Rio is you, Yuma.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.308
You.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:46.746
(Rio)
So that's why everyone
thinks we're dating?

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.747
(Bronk) Rio...

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.752
I shoulda known that Reginald
was at the center of all this.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.257
What's going' on?

00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:58.558
Why are we here, Rio?

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.261
I challenge you to a duel.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:01.728
You too?

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.530
Lotta that goin' around today.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.066
I'm serious, Reginald.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.635
Do you think this is funny?

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.370
I don't even know
what """this" is.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.539
You're my big brother,
but you do not get

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.740
to make my decisions for me!

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:19.279
Rio, I, uh...
This is between
me and Reginald.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.480
I got things to do.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.748
(Rio) Too scared?

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.750
I know how you can get
scared sometimes.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.720
It's like your strange
fear of onions.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.389
Maybe I'll have
Flip blog about it!

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.624
No, you won't!

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.158
I'm serious, Rio.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.660
Not cool!
Hmph!

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.328
Well, if you don't want
the whole school

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.766
knowing about that, then
you've gotta duel me.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.035
A battle between
brother and sister.

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:45.238
We should wear ear plugs.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.676
I'm locked and loaded!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.417
(both) Duel Gazer set!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.123
(both) Bring it on!

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:05.558
(Shark)
You've never beaten
me in a duel.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.627
That's not gonna change.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.763
Not today, hah!

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.066
I summon Big Jaws!

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:22.742
And it lets me summon Shark
Stickers from my hand!

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:29.416
I overlay my Level 3 Big
Jaws and Shark Stickers!

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:34.554
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network.

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:42.696
I Xyz Summon Submersible
Carrier Aero Shark!

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:45.231
(Yuma) Did you guys see that?

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:49.135
He was able to Xyz Summon on his
first turn like it was nothing!

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:53.440
And now to really get things
going, by using an overlay unit,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.476
for every card in my hand,
I can hit you with

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.045
400 points of damage!

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.747
Not wasting any time, is he?

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.551
She has no way to
block this, does she?

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.420
This is what happens when
you bring up the onions.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.757
Go Torpedo Take Down!

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:12.559
Incoming!

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:17.764
Guess it's a good thing I've got
Guard Penguin to protect me!

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.402
It reduces the damage
I would have taken to zero!

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:26.740
And when it's done,
it can stick around.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.211
I'd say that was
a purr-fect move!

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:32.345
It sure was!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.214
You're the best, Rio!

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:34.681
Hmph!

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.384
Any wannabe could have pulled
off a counter like that.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.186
Well, it takes one to
know one, Reginald!

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:44.624
Let's see if you're still saying
that after I play Aqua Gate!

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.526
This spell negates
your attack once for

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:52.032
every facedown spell
or trap on my field.

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:57.670
And since I'm ending my turn
with two facedown cards,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.306
that means I can
stop two attacks.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:03.209
Your move, what
are you gonna do?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.345
Hmph, you're about
to find out.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:08.114
Watch this onion boy!

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.550
My turn!

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.354
First I summon Blizzard Falcon!

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.695
And now I overlay Guard
Penguin and Blizzard Falcon!

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:29.569
I Xyz Summon
Ice Beast Zerofyne!

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:34.441
Rio!

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.043
If you attack, that Aqua
Gate's gonna stop it!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.079
Good thing I've got
the perfect way

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.047
to deal with that Bronk!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.550
I activate Zerofyne's
special ability!

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.220
By using one Overlay Unit, all
other faceup cards have their

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.758
effects put on ice until the
beginning of my next turn.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.394
Perfect Freeze!

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:04.737
She froze the whole field?

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:08.074
Shark cannot defend
with Aqua Gate now.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:08.508
Cool move.

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:11.744
The best part is that for every
card that Zerofyne just froze,

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:15.281
one of your monsters
loses 300 attack points!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.750
Two cards had their
effects frozen:

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.752
Aero Shark and Aqua Gate.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:22.622
Which means Aero Shark
is suddenly down

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.757
600 attack points.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.659
That's how it's done!

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.261
You go, Rio!

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.164
(Rio)
Wait a second, this
is too easy...

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:34.734
Shark had to have known
I'd summon Zerofyne...

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.736
Is Aqua Gate a decoy?

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:37.437
Of course!

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:40.740
I gotta switch gears and focus
on those two facedowns.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.741
In that case...

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:45.311
I equip Wings of Silence
onto Ice Beast Zerofyne!

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.314
If you were thinking of stopping
Zerofyne with one of your

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.117
facedown cards, I've got
some bad news for you...

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.220
Not only will Wings of Silence
raise Zerofyne's attack points

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.756
by three-hundred, but
it'll also protect it

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.058
from your spell and trap cards.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.093
A smart precaution.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:03.763
However, shark does
not seem fazed.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.598
Do it, Zerofyne!

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.100
Attack Aero Shark!

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.736
Icicle Storm!

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:13.740
Oh, yeah!

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.142
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:20.213
Too bad I didn't walk right
into your little trap.

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:21.548
It really is too bad.

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:25.718
Too bad you're dueling just
like I knew you would!

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.589
'Cause now I'm activating
the trap Ghost Salvage.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:33.126
This trap brings back my
Water Attribute Xyz Monster.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:36.563
And when it returns, it can
bring along two monsters that

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:38.765
were used to Summon
it by negating

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.100
their special abilities.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:47.507
So here come Big Jaws, Shark
Stickers and Aero Shark!

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:51.044
Shark's got a lot of
monsters out there.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:55.014
Yeah, but their bite's not so
bad without their abilities...

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:58.685
I activate the trap Full Armored
Xyz, which gives me the power

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:02.722
to Xyz Summon no matter
whose turn it is!

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.325
Seriously?

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:08.661
I overlay my Level 3 Shark
Stickers and Big Jaws

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:11.664
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:16.569
I Xyz Summon Black Ray Lancer!

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:22.108
And now, thanks to Full Armored
Xyz, I can equip Aero Shark

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:28.748
onto Black Ray Lancer and
combine their attack points.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.695
That's a whole lotta power!

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:44.998
Looks like you did walk
right into my trap.

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:49.669
There was never any way you
were going to beat me, sis.

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:55.041
There was never any way you
were going to beat me, sis.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.143
I place one card facedown...

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.479
and end my turn.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.348
Heh, I knew you
couldn't do nothin'!

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:05.752
I activate the
spell Break Stream!

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.754
When Black Ray Lancer attacks,

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:12.992
you can't activate
a spell or trap!

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.095
Meanwhile, due to
Zerofyne, Aqua Gate's

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.764
effect cannot be used.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:20.133
Conceivably, there is
nothing she can do

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:23.002
to stop Black Ray Lancer.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:26.506
(Bronk)
C'mon, Rio,
you can do it.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:27.573
(Shark) Black Ray Lancer!

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:32.745
Attack Zerofyne with
Shimmering Spear Slash!

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:41.220
And next, I activate Break
Stream's other effect!

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.389
When Black Ray Lancer
destroys a monster,

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:49.128
Break Stream gets rid of one
of your spell or trap cards!

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:57.236
You've never had what it
takes to be a real duelist.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:59.238
I remember when you
first started dueling,

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:01.507
you needed me to build
your deck for you...

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.742
You didn't know
what to do then,

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:06.279
and you don't know
what to do now.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.680
That's not true.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.249
You're wrong.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.317
I've changed, Reginald.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:14.387
You may have built my
deck when we were kids,

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:16.055
but I'm all grown up!

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.157
I don't need your
help anymore!

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:20.226
I do things my way!

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:24.764
I'm activating my trap
card Ice Fire Egg!

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:25.331
Huh?

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.600
How can she play a trap that
Break Stream destroyed?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.738
This particular trap card
activates when it's destroyed!

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:35.208
And it allows me to summon
one Water Xyz Monster from

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.210
my graveyard by
stripping it of all

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.178
its attack and defense points.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:41.514
I'm bringing back Zerofyne!

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:46.352
And Ice Fire Egg changes
Zerofyne to Level 5!

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.390
Awesome!
But uh...

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.425
It doesn't have
any attack points.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:56.629
Even if it did, Rio wouldn't
know what to do with them!

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:59.031
You're up.

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:02.735
(Rio)
If I don't draw the card
I'm hoping for... or...

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.571
if Reginald already
knows what I'm planning...

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.341
(Shark)
I bet I know what you're
thinking right now.

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:10.743
You're worried that I'm three
steps ahead of you, that this

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.747
facedown card will activate as
soon as you make your move.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:17.750
That's what you're
thinking, right, sis?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.088
Of course, 'cause
you doubt yourself.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.289
Rio...

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:28.094
(Shark)
Self-doubting wannabes
don't win duels.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.363
And that's why you
always lose to me.

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:35.067
Because you don't
trust your instincts.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.202
You're not gonna win.

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:38.438
You're just gonna keep
second guessing yourself

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:42.475
into corners and you know it.

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:45.478
(Bronk) Don't listen to him!

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.747
Rio, I know you can do this!

00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:49.615
You just gotta trust
yourself and, like,

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:53.753
don't get all caught up thinking
about what might happen...

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:56.756
Just take a chance in today!

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.758
That's right.

00:15:58.758 --> 00:15:59.392
You gotta high...

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:01.594
(Bronk)
You gotta high
five the sky!

00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:05.598
Come on, Rio, it's all you!

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:08.100
Bronk's right, I've
gotta take a chance.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.472
Get ready 'cause your little
sister is about to win big!

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:16.742
All right, I draw!

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:17.577
Got it!

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:21.581
I activate the field spell
Land of Frozen Flames!

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:24.183
If I use a Water
monster to Xyz Summon,

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.552
it counts as two monsters.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:31.123
And Zerofyne is
a Water monster!

00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:34.760
So she's got two
Level 5 monsters!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.196
I think you know
where this is going...

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:41.501
I overlay both of my
Ice Beast Zerofynes!

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.671
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:50.743
I Xyz summon Ice
Princess Zereort!

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:06.192
I activate Ice Princess'
special ability!

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.328
By using one Overlay Unit,
Ice Princess takes away

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.464
your monster's attack points!

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:14.700
Subzero Subtraction!

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.739
That's one way to shut
down a powerful monster.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:20.406
Yeah!

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:24.744
Ice Princess attack
Black Ray Lancer!

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.714
By activating Full Armored Xyz's
effect, I send Aero Shark to

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:33.386
the graveyard and my Black
Lancer isn't destroyed!

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.587
(Rio) Nice save.

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:36.422
But you still take damage!

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:40.126
Rio's almost got him
down for the count!

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.395
And with that,
I'm ending my turn.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:48.734
I gotta admit, you really
surprised me just now, sis.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.735
Maybe I was wrong...

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:53.739
Maybe you are one
amazing duelist.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:54.740
Do you...

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:56.509
Do you mean that?

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:59.679
Get real, Rio!
"An amazing duelist?"

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.647
I don't think so!

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.549
It's my turn, here goes!

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.751
First I summon Drill Barnacle!

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:11.624
Next up, I'm equipping Xyz
Crown onto Black Ray Lancer!

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:15.528
This spell changes my Xyz
Monster's Rank into a Level,

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:17.463
and makes it count
as two monsters!

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:21.133
And thanks to your field
spell Land Of Frozen Flames,

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.536
Drill Barnacle also
counts as two!

00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:26.272
I'm pretty sure I don't
like where this is goin'.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:31.744
I overlay both Drill Barnacles
and both Black Ray Lancers!

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:36.749
With these four monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:44.490
I Xyz Summon the king of
the deep, Shark Caesar!

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:52.431
I Xyz Summon the king of
the deep, Shark Caesar!

00:18:52.565 --> 00:18:55.501
Shark used Rio's field
spell to his advantage.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:59.505
Quite impressive, truly.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.476
Go, Shark Caesar, attack!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.076
Wait, what?

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.145
But it's not as powerful
as Ice Princess!

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.749
(Shark)
By using one Overlay
Unit, Shark Caesar

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:11.651
gains 3,000 attack points!

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.753
You gotta be kidding!

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:19.191
This duel only had one
possible outcome, Rio.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:23.763
And that's me winning
and you losing!

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:27.266
Go Emperor's Might!

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.750
Rio...

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.256
You win again.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.726
But next time, you won't
be so lucky onion boy.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:57.463
Look, you are getting better,
so at least there's that.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.297
Hmph!

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:01.567
But still, if you think I'm
gonna become Yuma's girlfriend

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.637
just because you say
I should, you're crazy.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:07.373
Did you say """become
Yuma's girlfriend?

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.742
Why would I think that?

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:10.342
Hold on.

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.745
All I said to Bronk, is that
Yuma's the only duelist

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:17.717
around who can kinda
keep up with me.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.318
So then...

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:19.752
Uhhh...

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.721
It was our misunderstanding?

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.356
Well, this is embarrassing.

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:25.391
Rio...

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.759
That was an awesome duel.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:29.295
You and I should duel sometime!

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:30.629
You and me?

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:31.063
Yeah!

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:35.534
We could help each other get
better, and maybe... maybe...

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.471
Maybe if you win, then uh...

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:40.339
(Rio) Then what?

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:43.442
Maybe I'll buy
you an ice cream.

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:45.711
Sounds like a good deal to me.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.345
(Bronk) Cool.

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:51.751
(Rio)
Now, um, there's something
I need to go deal with.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:54.754
Guys?

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:59.759
About that little
rumor you started...
