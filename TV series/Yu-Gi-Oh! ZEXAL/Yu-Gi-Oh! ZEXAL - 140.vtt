WEBVTT

00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.635
(Yuma)
Last time onYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL...

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.737
Your defeat is inevitable.

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:08.439
Numeron calling!
Huh?

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.641
The energy flowing through
the Numeron Network

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:13.308
is powering his monsters.

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:17.278
Yuma... I can attempt to
follow the energy signature

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:18.446
back to its origin...

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:22.748
and discover the location
of the Numeron Network card.

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:26.050
That light!

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.217
This is it!

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:30.753
I will remove this card
and then destroy it.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:34.656
But if you destroy that card,
then all the immense energy

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.291
that has accumulated
at that location

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.725
will be instantly unleashed.

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:43.028
Though Astral World may survive,
Earth definitely will not.

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:50.633
I know what I must do...
and I do this for the future!

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:52.535
Earth will be fine...

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:56.103
I will absorb all the energy.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.738
(gasping)

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:00.506
Eliphas?

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:02.741
My time has finally come.

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:06.744
But your time
is just beginning.

00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:10.279
Eliphas! No!

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.983
He is no more. But he left us
something to remember him by.

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:20.553
Your win's not a sure
thing anymore, is it♪

00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:23.121
For the sake
of the whole universe,

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.722
you're going down!

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:26.323

Yuma and Nash!

00:02:29.997 --> 00:02:32.499
Our victory is close at hand.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.701
You think victory is any closer

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.702
because you
destroyed one obstacle

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:39.270
and regained a few life points?

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.607
You shall learn how wrong
you are! I draw!

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.275
You cannot avoid your destiny

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:47.942
to fall before my monsters!

00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:52.678
Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya
resurrects!

00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:57.282
Too little too late.

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:59.550
We shut
the Numeron Network down.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.119
Without it, Sunya can't
survive on the field!

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.954
How do ya like that,
Don Thousand?

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.523
So much for your Chaos Gate!

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:13.125
You fools...
You are dueling a deity.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:17.362
I have prepared for every
possibility, including this.

00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:22.465
I activate the spell
Numeron Chaos Ritual!

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:25.100
Since Numeron Sunya
was destroyed...

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.369
Numeron Chaos Ritual allows me
to treat Numeron Network

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:33.372
and four other Numbers in my
graveyard as Level 12 monsters

00:03:33.372 --> 00:03:37.174
which I can then use
to XYZ summon!

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:38.009
(gasping)

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.943
Behold your demise!

00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:44.979
I overlay Numeron Network
with Numbers 1 through 4!

00:03:49.682 --> 00:03:55.320
I XYZ summon
Chaos Number 1,000!

00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:08.928
Witness the ascension
of Numeronius!

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:20.670
(Yuma)
This just keeps
getting better!

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.138
10,000 attack points!

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:24.672
(gasping)

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:28.908
You will fall to the power
that stands before you.

00:04:28.908 --> 00:04:29.641
Tremble in fear

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:35.478
as Numeronius proceeds to
annihilate Silent Honor Dark!

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.647
This is not good.
Do something!

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:44.084
I got this. I activate
the trap Tidal Advantage!

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.986
This'll cut Numeronius's
attack points in half...

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:51.923
and save Silent Honor Dark
from being destroyed.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:05:00.862
Another pointless gesture...
You will still take damage.

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.531
(all screaming)

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:14.171
(Don Thousand)
And more terror will
rain down on Astral World.

00:05:15.638 --> 00:05:19.274
Do not fear...
we must stay strong.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:23.644
Astral and Yuma
are battling to save us.

00:05:23.644 --> 00:05:26.645
We must believe in them.

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:29.281
(groaning)

00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:31.549
You may have survived
that attack...

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:35.451
But that was just a mere
sample of Numeronius's power.

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.252
You will now feel
its full wrath!

00:05:38.252 --> 00:05:39.020
Its special ability

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.090
destroys every monster
on your field after battle.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.357
(groaning)

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.927
No!

00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:49.593
Furthermore...

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:52.962
every monster that I sent to
the graveyard during this turn

00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:56.631
is summoned to my field
in defense mode!

00:05:56.631 --> 00:06:00.634
Your monster is mine.

00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.506
You cannot win!

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:11.074
He's got us.
(Yuma)
Don't say that.

00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:15.110
It's what he wants.
He wants to break us.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.910
But he won't!

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.279
He may control our cards but
he's got no control over us!

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.514
So he can't make us lose heart!

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.583
Astral... you ready?

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:24.950
Always.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.953
It's time to
high-five the sky...
And feel the flow!

00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:32.454
When two distant souls
become one...

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:36.124
the power of Zexal is revealed!

00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:39.593
(both) Go, Zexal Morph!

00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:43.596
Your time is up!

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:51.000
Your theatrics
do not impress me.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.235
Then this totally will!

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.603
Don Thousand,
a truly powerful duelist

00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:57.071
can shape
the outcome of a duel...

00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:01.607
He can even generate the very
cards that he needs to draw!

00:07:03.442 --> 00:07:05.610
Go Shining Draw!

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.246
First, I activate
the spell card RE-XYZ!

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:14.883
This allows me to use monsters
in my graveyard to XYZ summon!

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:21.586
I overlay my Gagaga Magician
and my Toy Knight!

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:31.059
I XYZ summon Number 39 Utopia!

00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:34.495
Your maneuver is pointless.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:38.564
Numeronius uses
one Chaos Overlay Unit

00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:41.266
to destroy your monster.

00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:46.369
Utopia!

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:52.106
Then I can summon one new
Chaos Number to your field.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:59.478
Appear... Utopia Ray Victory!

00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:03.580
(Yuma)
But.. Why would you
destroy Utopia

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.549
and replace it with Victory?

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:09.350
Because... As long as
I have Numeronius...

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.519
Your Chaos Numbers
are worthless.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:16.589
They cannot use their special
abilities, nor can they attack!

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:17.590
(both groaning)

00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:20.858
Oh no. So then,
they can't do anything?

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:21.926
Yeah? So what!

00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:25.428
We've faced
much worse than this!

00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:31.332
I told you that we'll use
all our power to defeat you!

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:33.200
(gasping)

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.269
(Astral)
When two hearts join together
in the spirit of hope,

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:38.570
nothing is impossible!

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.571
(Astral and Yuma)
Go, Zexal Morph!

00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:43.073
I'm stronger... than ever!

00:08:43.073 --> 00:08:45.575
All right!
Show 'em who's boss, Yuma!

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:48.577
I activate the spell
XYZ Treasure!

00:08:48.577 --> 00:08:50.811
For every XYZ monster
on the field,

00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:52.445
I'm able to draw one card!

00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:54.280
And since you have two
while I have one,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.150
we're talking three new cards
that are coming to my hand!

00:08:59.317 --> 00:09:02.485
Which means this is
gonna be a triple threat!

00:09:02.485 --> 00:09:05.921
Watch me generate
the very cards that I need!

00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:08.456
Go, Shining Draw!

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:11.892
Get ready, Don Thousand.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:15.327
'Cause I'm summoning
Ouroboros Sage!

00:09:15.327 --> 00:09:17.828
(Astral)
After it is
successfully summoned,

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:22.065
we can also summon a monster
from the graveyard!

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:28.836
Here it comes!

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:33.339
Number 101...
Silent Honor Ark!

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.141
Next, I activate Ouroboros
Sage's special ability!

00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:42.545
Both Ouroboros Sage and Utopia
Ray Victory equip onto Ark,

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:44.546
combining
all their attack points...

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.315
But the awesome doesn't
stop there...

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:51.551
Any monster equipped with
Ouroboros Sage

00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:54.486
doubles its attack points.

00:09:56.187 --> 00:09:59.256
It has 11,000 attack points...

00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:01.390
And your monster doesn't.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.360
Go! Attack!

00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:15.532
Strike down Numeronius!

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:20.203
Rising Sun Ark Victory Slash!

00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:31.110
Bam!

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.877
Gettin' it done!

00:10:32.877 --> 00:10:33.544
Yeah!

00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:36.813
No more Numeronius
to worry about.

00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:39.315
But wait, Yuma...
Huh?

00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:43.784
What's the deal?
He still has Numeronius?

00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:47.086
Silent Honor Dark
isn't on his field!

00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:50.522
I have told you that
your attempts to defeat me

00:10:50.522 --> 00:10:52.156
are futile, have I not?

00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:54.991
By sending Silent Honor Dark
to the graveyard,

00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.960
I was able to stop Numeronius
from being destroyed.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.529
Hmm.
You've gotta be
kidding me...

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:03.330
Afraid not.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.498
And just as before...

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:09.901
Numeronius annihilates
every monster on your field!

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:17.006
And they return
as your adversaries

00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:20.841
because they are all
summoned to my field!

00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:25.512
There is nothing you can do
that I cannot undo.

00:11:25.512 --> 00:11:29.514
(groaning)
Even ZEXAL didn't work.

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:31.882
How do we defeat this guy?

00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:33.116
I told you, Yuma...

00:11:33.116 --> 00:11:35.952
there is no way to oppose
my limitless powers.

00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:40.055
Why, even Astral cannot deny
this unavoidable fact.

00:11:40.055 --> 00:11:43.156
When we fought eons ago,
you thought you won,

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:45.391
but that is far from the truth.

00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.492
What are you talking about?

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:50.361
That battle was
merely a precursor

00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.195
in my long-term strategy.

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:54.497
It appeared as if
you destroyed me,

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:57.432
but you were actually
more hurt than I was.

00:11:57.432 --> 00:12:01.201
Your powers and memories
were shattered into pieces,

00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:03.769
scattered throughout
the human world,

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:06.004
lost along
with the Numeron Code.

00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:11.308
My powers were also locked away
by the Mytherian Numbers,

00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:12.809
but I remained patient,

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:17.212
making sure they fell
into the right hands.

00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:20.280
And you tricked them
into helping you.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.847
Correct.

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:23.849
And the longer
they wielded my power,

00:12:23.849 --> 00:12:25.050
the stronger I grew.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.786
So while Astral remained weak,
I was mightier than ever!

00:12:29.786 --> 00:12:32.888
You humans are
so easy to manipulate.

00:12:32.888 --> 00:12:35.957
Their resistance to
my control was pathetic.

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:41.294
Nash, even your dearest friend
Dumon succumbed in the end.

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.295
(sinister chuckling)

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:47.798
And your sister
never stood a chance.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.967
And you, Nash.

00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:53.068
What about me?

00:12:53.068 --> 00:12:57.371
You were most instrumental
in resurrecting my power,

00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.473
though you never realized it.

00:12:59.473 --> 00:13:02.274
(Yuma)
That's enough,
Don Thousand!

00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:05.176
Nobody wants to
hear you babble.

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.478
All you're trying to do
is throw us off

00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:09.145
and make us doubt ourselves.

00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:12.481
Guess what...
it's not gonna work.

00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:15.716
Humans may have had a hand
in bringing you back...

00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:18.485
But this human's
sending you away!

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:22.454
I place these four cards...
and end my turn!

00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:25.456
You still cling to
the tiniest hope.

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:28.358
But that is all about to end.

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:32.160
I activate
the spell card Numeron Storm!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.962
When Numeronius is on my field,

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:40.232
this Storm destroys all of
your spell and trap cards.

00:13:40.232 --> 00:13:41.066
(all gasping)

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.868
You have lost everything...

00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.468
but you will still lose more!

00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:49.805
Numeron Storm deals you
1,000 points of damage!

00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:52.974
(screaming)

00:13:53.474 --> 00:13:56.176
(groaning)

00:13:56.309 --> 00:14:00.378
This is not good.
Is there no way they can win?

00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:02.380
You have no monsters...

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.415
No facedown cards...

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:06.182
No cards in your hands...

00:14:06.182 --> 00:14:09.451
Your pathetic efforts end here!

00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:14.121
Numeronius!
Attack them directly!

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:17.356
Farewell, Yuma.

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:23.093
Numeronius!
Attack them directly!

00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:24.061
(groaning)

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:25.995
Farewell, Yuma.

00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:27.863
Yuma!

00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:33.967
I tried my best!

00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:36.436
(Kite) Well, try harder.

00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:36.936
Huh?

00:14:36.936 --> 00:14:41.138
(Kite)
Giving up
is not your style.

00:14:41.138 --> 00:14:42.406
Can it be?

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:43.940
Impossible...

00:14:45.908 --> 00:14:47.743
You're not seriously
going to let

00:14:47.743 --> 00:14:50.211
some big deity
push you around...

00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:52.179
are you?

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:53.447
Kite!

00:14:53.447 --> 00:14:57.449
I left you something, Yuma.

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:58.950
Remember?

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.218
Use it.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.420
Of course.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.022
Kite's card.

00:15:07.022 --> 00:15:10.925
Numeron Dragon...

00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:13.793
Kite is counting on me.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.896
And I promise that
I won't let him down!

00:15:19.297 --> 00:15:22.299
Okay, guys.
We got this!

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:26.901
Here's Number 100!
Numeron Dragon!

00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:29.436
If you attack me
when I have no cards

00:15:29.436 --> 00:15:31.271
on my field or in my hand,

00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:35.407
I can summon this monster
in defense mode!

00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:50.417
(Don Thousand)
So you managed to awaken
the great Numeron Dragon...

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:56.121
No matter... Numeronius,
attack Numeron Dragon!

00:15:56.287 --> 00:16:00.423
I activate Numeron Dragon's
special ability!

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:04.960
Numeronius loses
all its attack points!

00:16:07.128 --> 00:16:07.995
A hollow gesture.

00:16:07.995 --> 00:16:11.930
My Numeronius still destroys
your Numeron Dragon

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.932
after the battle!

00:16:16.967 --> 00:16:18.702
Yuma... Now!

00:16:18.702 --> 00:16:19.169
On it!

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:21.137
When Numeron Dragon
is destroyed,

00:16:21.137 --> 00:16:25.406
all your monsters
get destroyed too!

00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:35.946
So just like us,

00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:38.882
you don't have any monsters
either, Don Thousand.

00:16:38.882 --> 00:16:43.017
And Numeron Dragon has
one last special ability.

00:16:43.017 --> 00:16:44.685
Do you remember all those spell

00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:46.820
and trap cards
that you destroyed?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.121
Well, they're back!

00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:49.722
Yuma.

00:16:49.722 --> 00:16:52.390
You still fail to understand.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.391
All you have done

00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:56.193
is push yourself closer
to the ultimate end.

00:16:56.193 --> 00:16:56.693
(gasping)

00:16:56.693 --> 00:17:00.295
You believed destroying
Numeronius would hinder me,

00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:03.197
but it is just the opposite!

00:17:03.197 --> 00:17:04.398
Yaah!

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:09.401
When it is in my graveyard,
I can use it to XYZ summon

00:17:09.401 --> 00:17:12.103
an even more powerful monster!

00:17:12.103 --> 00:17:15.205
Arise from the great beyond!

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:18.073
Chaos Imaginary Number 1,000!

00:17:18.073 --> 00:17:21.809
Numeronius Numeronia!

00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:45.958
That monster has
100,000 attack points.

00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.359
How is that even possible?

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.060
Aah!

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.728
(Don Thousand)
Though Numeronia
cannot attack,

00:17:51.728 --> 00:17:53.363
your monsters must battle it

00:17:53.597 --> 00:17:56.265
as long as it
remains on the field.

00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:59.234
Should you choose
not to attack it...

00:17:59.234 --> 00:18:04.370
then at the end of your turn...
you instantly lose.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.339
(Nash)
So we have to attack
that thing or that's it?

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:09.907
It's all over?

00:18:09.907 --> 00:18:10.875
No way...

00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:13.076
Is there anything
you guys can do?

00:18:13.076 --> 00:18:14.376
(Don Thousand chuckles evilly)

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.780
Only now do you realize
that you have no hope.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.380
That you never had hope...

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.349
You are nothing.

00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:23.249
(sinister chuckle)

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:25.284
That's where you're wrong.

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:26.718
Huh?

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:27.352
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

00:18:27.352 --> 00:18:30.087
My friends and I are
more than you'll ever be.

00:18:30.087 --> 00:18:33.356
And we'll never lose hope!
So for them...

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.958
For everyone I've ever known...

00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.359
I'll fight to the very end.

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:40.360
I'm right there with ya, Yuma!

00:18:40.594 --> 00:18:43.796
I am with you as well.
Until the end.

00:18:43.796 --> 00:18:45.231
Ready?

00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:46.364
Yes.

00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:48.665
(both yelling)

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:53.868
(in unison)
When two kindred spirits unite,
their future has no limits!

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:56.338
Ultimate Zexal Morph!

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:58.005
Let's go!

00:18:58.005 --> 00:19:01.241
I have never felt
this much power!

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:04.776
I activate...
Session Draw!

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.178
This trap
lets me draw two cards

00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:09.212
at the start of my next turn.

00:19:09.212 --> 00:19:10.347
And if the two cards I draw

00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:13.848
both happen to be monster
cards with the same level...

00:19:13.848 --> 00:19:16.351
I can use those cards
to XYZ summon.

00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:20.353
So... a final
desperate scramble...

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:23.021
I end my turn.

00:19:23.021 --> 00:19:25.289
This is the moment
of truth, Yuma.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:29.192
Yup...
Let's do this... together.

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:32.327
Chaos Draw!

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:36.742
Destiny Shining Draw!

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.744
Aah!

00:19:41.087 --> 00:19:43.956
Oh, yeah...
exactly what I needed!

00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:47.493
It's Zexal Weapon
Tornado Bringer!

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:51.497
The card I drew is
Panther Shark!

00:19:51.497 --> 00:19:53.499
They're both Level 5.

00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:55.334
And that means one thing...

00:19:55.334 --> 00:19:57.403
we can overlay
these two monsters

00:19:57.403 --> 00:20:00.173
to XYZ summon!

00:20:01.507 --> 00:20:07.013
(Nash)
Number 73: Abyss Splash!

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:11.851
And now I activate
the trap... Utopia Rising!

00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:17.156
Utopia rises from my graveyard
and equips this card.

00:20:18.124 --> 00:20:21.928
And I activate the trap,
Bonds of Hope!

00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:24.897
When an XYZ Monster is
summoned onto our field,

00:20:24.897 --> 00:20:28.034
I can summon another XYZ Monster
from the graveyard!

00:20:28.034 --> 00:20:33.840
Number 100... Numeron Dragon
is back in action!

00:20:34.807 --> 00:20:36.976
Furthermore, Bonds of Hope

00:20:36.976 --> 00:20:40.746
moves all the Overlay Units
from one XYZ Monster

00:20:40.746 --> 00:20:41.848
and puts it on another!

00:20:41.848 --> 00:20:47.253
I move Abyss Splash's Overlay
Units on to Utopia!

00:20:47.253 --> 00:20:51.491
Which means Utopia's now got
three Overlay Units.

00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:56.496
All right, Yuma!
You know what to do next!

00:20:56.496 --> 00:20:58.364
Count on it!

00:20:58.364 --> 00:21:02.935
I activate Utopia Rising's
additional effect!

00:21:02.935 --> 00:21:04.303
This enables Utopia to use

00:21:04.303 --> 00:21:08.841
Numeron Dragon and Abyss
Splash's special abilities.

00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:13.145
Utopia gains the powers
of the other two?

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.747
Amazing.

00:21:14.747 --> 00:21:16.148
With those three monsters,

00:21:16.148 --> 00:21:22.088
it's like Yuma, Kite, and Shark
are all fighting as one!

00:21:23.489 --> 00:21:25.024
See, Don Thousand?

00:21:25.024 --> 00:21:28.127
We'll fight together...
as a team.

00:21:28.127 --> 00:21:34.100
We're gonna put you down...
Once and for all.

00:22:38.164 --> 00:22:41.500
