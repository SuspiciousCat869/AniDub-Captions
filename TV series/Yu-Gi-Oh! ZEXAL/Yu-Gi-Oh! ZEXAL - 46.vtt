WEBVTT

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.660
[laughing]

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.760
VETRIX: Too funny!

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.970
So Trey, you want to
meet with yuma tsukumo?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.100
Trey: Yes I do.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.510
I have questions.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.050
He was the reason
we lost our last duel.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.550
Yuma's power was
too strong to overcome.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.970
I want to know how he learned
to duel with such intensity.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.300
What's the source of his power?

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.970
I won't rest until I
discover the truth for myself.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.510
Alright, Trey.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.180
I can go?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.990

intriguing, I encourage it.

YUMA: Oh, c'mon!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.350
There's gotta be someone
around here willing to duel me!

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.430
How about you, sir?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.430
Will ya?

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.220
Huh?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.350
Huh?

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.760
You won't?

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.850
Fine then!

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.970
Hey, kid, wanna duel?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.970
How about you?

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.430
Please duel me!

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.260
No, I meant duel with cards!

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.970
Tori: Will you get a grip?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.850
You're embarrassing me!

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.350
I'm in big trouble, Tori.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.970
If I don't win my
last heart piece,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.140
I'm out of the tournament.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.430
It's the last day of
the preliminaries!

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.600
I need an opponent... and quick!

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970
Wait for me at least!

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.970
Wait up!

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.470
I can't!
The clock is ticking!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.970
Astral: Be at peace yuma.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.300
You will find the duelist that
you are meant to battle with.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.370
You sound like a
fortune cookie!

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.970
Hey!

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.970
Are you okay?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.970
Buddy!

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.760
Tell me what happened to you.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.970
Duelist a: I was...
dueling shark.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.930
Whoa...

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.220
it looks like a
tornado hit this place.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.970
Shark did this?

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.390
Duelist B: Stop, that's enough!

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.640
I give up!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.250
I give up!

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.600
Shark.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.970
Whoa... shark.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.700
Why did you do this?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.640
Hold on.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.970
Aren't you even
gonna try to explain?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.430
Shark: Explain what?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.510
There's a tournament going
on and I'm dueling in it.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.600
Come on!

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.680
You know what I mean!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.140
Some duelists
like to talk trash.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.100
But I've decided to start
trashing my opponents directly.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.970
Shark, listen to me.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.970
If you try to interfere
I'll make sure you regret it.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.080
Stay out of my way.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.640
You can't leave, shark.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.970
Why not?

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.680
Cause I won't let you.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.640
Think you can stop me, yuma?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.100
Yeah I'm challenging you, shark.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.970
We are gonna duel!

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.800
Right here and now?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.550
That's right, you heard me.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.680
I won't take no for an answer!

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.970
You're on then.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.760
I'd never turn down
the chance to make

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.850
this the worst day of your life.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.930
Great.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.970
We're set!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.970
Yuma!

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.140
It is unwise to
duel while angry.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
You save it.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.970
I know what I'm doing.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.600
Duel disk go!

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.390
This duel's gonna be epic.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.990
An epic fail for you.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.950
Duel gazer, let's roll!

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.050
Computer VOICE: Augmented
reality Vision Link established.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.970
Let's duel!

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.970
Yuma is dueling against shark?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.850
The last time shark dueled,
a number fragment entered his

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.890
body, filling him
with hate. Perfect!

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.760
I can learn a lot
from watching this duel.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.790
Yuma, soon all of your dueling
secrets... will be revealed.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.640
Now!

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.970
Big jaws,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.970
polish off gagaga magician!

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.050
Gulp Grind attack!

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.720
Gagaga, no!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.930
Next I'm comin' at you directly!

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.010
Hammer shark, attack!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.680
I play the trap
card small resistance!

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.970
Since gagaga girl
is in my graveyard,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.970
hammer shark loses
attack points equal to her

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.750
attack points!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.390
That was nothing.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.640
Can't you do any better?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.140
No problem.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.430
I'll just have to stop
taking it easy on ya!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.720
But first I'll
need a bigger fish!

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.930
I overlay my level 3
hammer shark and big jaws!

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.800
With These two monsters I
build the overlay network and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.970
xyz summon, submersible
Carrier aero shark!

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.680
I activate aero shark's
special ability!

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.100
So now you're gonna get hit with
four hundred points of damage

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.890
for each card in my hand!

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.510
And I've got three of them!

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.250
Torpedo Take down!

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.970
Yuma!

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.510
Ready to call it quits?

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.600
It's Only gonna get worse.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.850
Is that all you got?

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.180
Honestly, I think
you're losin' your edge.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.510
Try Harder next time!

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.430
You go.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.760
Good, then watch me carefully.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.970
Maybe you'll learn something!

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.250
I summon gogogo
giant in attack mode!

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.140
I end my turn.
You're up shark.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.640
What's that?

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.600
Why, yuma?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.970
Is this wise?

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.010
If you attack with
your giant now,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.430
it can destroy
shark's monster.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.140
Do you have some
other plan in mind?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.390
Not really.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.550
I'm just goin'
with the flow.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.930
Alright then.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.600
I'll go!

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.970
What is yuma up to?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.970
It's like our last duel.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.510
He was unpredictable
and never gave up.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.970
Yuma wasn't just dueling
to win a single victory.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.260
And he wasn't trying
to get even with his

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.760
enemies either.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.390
Yuma, what is it
that motivates you?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.600
Quinton: Are you sure it was
a good idea to let Trey go?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.010
I am worried vetrix.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.100
Yuma's powers are far
greater than you may realize.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.970
What if Trey falls under his
influence and doesn't come back?

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.550
Don't be concerned.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.970
Your brother is
going to return.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.510
And you're sure of that?

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.010
Yes.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.970
Trey is too trusting and
loyal to ever leave us.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.970
That's just the way he is.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.990
I summon out black ray lancer!

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.100
This is serious!

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.890
Lancer, take
down that giant!

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.830
Go Shimmering Spear slash!

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.260
I'm sorry gogogo giant.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.300
Submersible Carrier aero shark,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.750
attack yuma directly
with devouring dive!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.950
Are you okay?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.220
Why are you dueling
so recklessly, yuma?

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.640
I'm still in this.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.850
You haven't broken
me yet, shark!

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.140
C'mon.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.260
If you want me to end up like
those other duelists you pushed

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.700
around, you'll
have to try Harder.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.970
Careful.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.140
You are losing this duel.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.850
I don't care.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.350
It doesn't matter
if I win or lose.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.970
I'm gonna let shark beat
me if that's what it takes!

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.390
Wait yuma...

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.970
Hey!

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.220
Listen, if I'm your enemy,

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.430
then why don't you use
all that anger building

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.470
up inside you against me?

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.970
Strike at me as hard as you can!

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.970
If that's what it's gonna take
to get rid of all your anger,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.970
do it!

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.300
Be quiet!

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.600
Tell me are you proud of
yourself for dueling this way?

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.260
Well, are you shark?

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.930
You used to love dueling,
but if you keep this up

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.800
you're gonna grow to hate it
and you'll hate yourself too!

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.600
You're my friend shark, and
I don't wanna see you destroy

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.220
yourself with hate.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.370
I won't let you!

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.510
Uh yuma...

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.970
oops.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.970
Nice job!

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.140
That sure spoiled the mood!

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.970
I can't help it if my food
Tank's runnin' on empty!

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.600
I must say, your sense of timing
is as bad as your dueling.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.890
Gimme a break!

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.600
How can I control my stomach?

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.970
It's got a mind of its own.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.100
You didn't even
say, "excuse me!"

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.350
excuse me. There, happy now?

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.800
Wait.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.640
Shark's heart freed itself
by getting rid of the

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.970
anger from that number.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.180
True champions don't
take snack breaks.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.760
That's it.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.390
I'm out of here.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.050
See you, yuma.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.600
You're quitting?

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.600
But why?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.720
You can't!

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.100
I guess you could say,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.970
I lost my "Appetite"
for crushing you.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.970
Ha, ha!

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.180
You can't chicken out!

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.950
You can get your
revenge in the finals.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.600
Wipe off that
goofy grin, yuma!

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.600
What have I done wrong now?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.350
It's what you didn't do!

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:14.470
You didn't get to the Finals
yet or have you forgotten that?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.430
I forgot I still need
to win one more heart

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.390
piece by the
end of today!

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.350
In your urge to
help your friend,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.970
you also forgot one other fact.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.220
Had you lost to shark, I would
have faded from existence along

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.180
with all the numbers
that we have gathered.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.220
Sorry!

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.050
Guess I was feelin'
too much flow and

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.010
I blanked about the
tournament and the numbers!

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.010
Don't forget what you
once promised your father.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.470
You swore you'd become a
champion duelist someday.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.970
Yeah and I'm gonna
keep that promise.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.970
But I still think
I did the right thing.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.220
I bet dad would've risked
losing to help shark.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:53.720
So he probably would've
been proud of what I did!

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.870
Maybe yuma's
father is the key.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.990
This must be yuma's
mother and father.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.970
That's amazing.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.970
Grandma: Who are you?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.390
Uh... I'm a friend of yuma's.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.970
Will someone Please duel me?

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.140
Help me out here!

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.390
I mean...

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.800
who's calling me?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.220
Hey, grandma.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.550
What's going on?

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.540
Your friend is here.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.990
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.600
Yuma.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.260
It is fate.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.140
Fate that brought me
here to your house today!

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.970
Otherwise I wouldn't have seen
all these awesome artifacts.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.300
You have aztec masks,
paleolithic tools, and...No way!

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.430
A royal incan necklace?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.100
Sorry for geeking out, but
this collection is incredible!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.970
It's just like the
stuff in my favorite Cards.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.180
Look.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.720
Isn't that an aztec Mask golem?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.970
Yeah. Cool, huh?

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.890
This was one of the
first cards I collected

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.430
for my chronomaly deck.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.180
Chronomalys are mysterious
artifacts that could Link this

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.970
world to other dimensions.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.760
See, this world is part of a
multi-Dimensional matrix, and

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.390
chronomalys may have come
here from another dimension.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.390
My father was a researcher
and taught me about it.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.050
Whoa!

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.430
My dad was into that
kind of stuff too.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.600
He'd go on expeditions and
always bring things back.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.970
Wow, that's cool.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.800
It sounds like he was
somebody who loved adventure.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.970
Yep. Just like me!

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.970
We have way more
important things to discuss!

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.970
Like what you
guys did to Hart!

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.680
I know.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.140
I feel truly sorry for
what happened to him.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.890
Really?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.180
I did what I had to.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.680
Huh?

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.890
I guess... I figured
the best way to duel

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.140
was to tap into the
anger in my heart.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.970
But then I saw how you duel,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.970
and I started to realize
there might be a better way.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.550
What's your secret?

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.760
I've seen how unselfish you
can be when you're dueling.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.430
Is that the source
of the power you have?

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.970
What do you mean power?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.220
The way you duel

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.970
is unlike anything I've seen.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.970
Like you're dueling
with all your heart

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.890
and nothing can stop you.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.470
I duel that way because...

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.970
because of...

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.970
it's the only way
I know how to duel.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.970
I just always try
to high five the sky!

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.970
High five the sky?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.970
Right!

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.510
When I was small my father told

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.600
me to never give
up or stop trying!

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.890
Feel the flow and go for it!

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.970
That's awesome advice.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.140
Kari: Hey, yuma.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.300
Lunch is ready, c'mon!

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.680
And you're all
welcome to join us.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.970
Oh yeah!

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.970
Duel fuel!

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.970
Let's dig in!

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.970
Yuma!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.350
Not so fast.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.720
Wait for everyone to sit.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.010
Sorry, grandma.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.890
Good boy.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.930
Please yuma, try to
eat like a human today.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.430
I'll try.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.300
Wow. That looks delish!

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.510
There's plenty.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.640
Have a seat.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.890
Uh... thank you!

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.550
Mmm, not bad.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.410
They're kinda small though.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.050
Lillybot: Tea is ready.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.140
Tea is ready.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.470
Be careful, tea is hot!

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.430
Sip it slowly this time, yuma.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.260
Okay, I know how
to drink tea!

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.510
No you don't.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.970
No you don't.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.970
Why didn't you
warn me it was hot?

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.390
Yuma stinks at drinking tea.
Yuma stinks at drinking tea.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.600
I don't see what's
so funny, Trey!

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.970
You're right yuma.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.760
The way you eat
isn't funny.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.430
It's disgusting.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.220
I can't help
it I'm in a rush.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.100
It's an emergency!

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.350
Honest.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.680
I gotta duel.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.850
No cards at the kitchen
table, got it?

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.970
I was just showin' ya!

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.100
Give them back, sis!

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.550
You don't want me
to get eliminated

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.760
from the tournament do ya?

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.680
You'll get 'em back
when we're all done.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.970
That could take forever!

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.990
Can't you see I'm in a hurry?

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.720
Oh, quattro!

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.970
I almost forgot
to show you!

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.140
It's an aztec Mask golem.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.550
Father gave it to me today!

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.350
QUATTRO: How come I
didn't get one too?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.600
I want it!

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.970
Hey.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.970
Give it back to me!

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.970
That's my card!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.510
Oh Yeah?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.300
C'mon let me have it back!

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.260
You gotta take it from me!

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.970
Get your own Mask card!

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.510
Alright that's enough you two.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.180
Father should be home any
minute so you'd better behave.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:18.970
He started it.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.050
Can I please have it back?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.970
Okay.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.800
You guys be on
your best behavior

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.390
and I'll teach you
how to duel later.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.970
That a promise?

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.720
Sure.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.410
Thanks, Quinton.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.970
Just watch me!

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.800
I'll be the tournament champion!

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.050
You haven't even advanced yet.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.680
You're one win short still.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.930
<i>My family used to be like this.</i>

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.550
<i>But that was so long ago.</i>

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.390
What's wrong?

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.080
Not feeling well?

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:05.390
Are you okay?

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.470
Please excuse me,
but I have to leave.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.300
Trey, hold up!

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.330
<i>Sorry yuma, but I know
what I have to do now.</i>

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.640
Trey what's going on?

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.720
After spending time with you,
I think I understand now, yuma.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.680
It's your family.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.300
They give you power.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.350
It's not the same with me.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.390
My family is
different than yours.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.350
It wasn't always that way.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.680
We used to be as happy
as your family is.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.050
The day we swore we'd get
revenge on our enemies,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.600
everything changed.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.680
It was like we
became different people.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.050
Maybe, once we
do get our revenge,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.850
we'll go back to
the way we were.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.510
You're in our way!

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.850
We can't get vengeance because
you keep getting in our way.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.470
I will find a way
to defeat you.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.720
For the sake of
my family, I must!

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.970
You're wrong, Trey.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.970
Revenge isn't the answer.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.430
It'll just destroy you.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.050
I have to be loyal
to my family!

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.970
But Trey...

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.850
I'll do whatever
I have to, yuma.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.390
Oh, yeah?

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.800
You'll see!

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.550
Here!

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.410
We'll settle this
tonight. Once and for all!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.970
He wants to meet you
at these coordinates?

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.100
I guess.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.970
We're gonna have
a duel, yuma!

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.970
And you will lose.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.660
Trey, don't go!

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.850
You're back?

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.180
Welcome home, Trey.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.390
Was your trip a success?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.600
Yes.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.970
I guess.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.100
You don't have
to tell me a thing.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.680
I already understand.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.430
You're hungry for power.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.600
The power that can help
you crush yuma tsukumo.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.550
Yes!

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.140
Yuma, I do not
trust that boy.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.550
I advise you not
to meet with Trey.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.510
I have to go. To talk to him.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.600
Trey's better than he pretends.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.140
There's a chance I can help him.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.300
I have to try.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.390
I will meet Trey.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.410
Tonight we're gonna duel!
