WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.796
(thunder)

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:18.645
(laughing)

00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:27.921
Rio, what's wrong?

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.924
You almost squeezed
the lunch out of me.

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:31.992
Sorry about that.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.760
It won't happen again.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.263
Why do I keep
having that nightmare?

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:37.898
Who is that guy?

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.267

This is the location of
the final ruins.

00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:45.198
The sixth and seventh
Mythyrian Numbers are there.

00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:48.935
These ruins may provide clues on
uncovering the identities

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.338
of the final
two Barian emperors.

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:53.640
Sounds like a big deal...
Is Kite gonna join us?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209
No, he said there was something
he wanted to check out,

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.912
but he didn't
tell me what it was.

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:00.680
It's got to be Mizar.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.682
Yeah, well
even if we're a man down,

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:04.851
we can totally handle the job!

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:05.218
True.

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:07.654
Hopefully we will not have
to handle anything

00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:09.389
and finding
the Numbers will prove easy.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.892
Yeah, I'm totally looking
forward to nice and easy!

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.795
It doesn't matter if it's
impossible!

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:18.298
We're gonna
get 'em no matter what!

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:20.367
Better buckle up...

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.370
'cause I'm puttin' the pedal
to the metal!

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:32.245
The legend contained within
hat Mythyrian Number

00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.247
claimed you used to be human.

00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:36.716
I am a Barian, I could never
have been a human.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:39.052
That legend is nothing
more than a fairytale.

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:42.389
I am done with trying to find
these Mythyrian Numbers.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.958
However you may feel about
those stories,

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.893
we still need those numbers

00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:48.061
to protect Barian World.

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.764
And, if they can help me
find our two missing comrades,

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:55.035
it's even more important to
find them right now.

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:01.374
Hey, Astral...

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:04.911
Are you sure that the Barians
started out as humans?

00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:08.381
I do not doubt the memory
I received from the Numbers.

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.383
So what turned
them into Barians?

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:12.319
There's gotta be a
reason right?

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.221
It is possible that there was
some common factor

00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.392
in their legends that
reincarnated them as Barians.

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:20.894
If you're smart you won't
worry about

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:25.665
who or what the Barians are.

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:27.067
Why's that?

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.369
Because as soon as personal
feelings are involved,

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:30.704
things always get messy.

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:33.773
Remember what happened with
your friend Ray?

00:03:33.773 --> 00:03:35.175
Then what's your reason?

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:37.911
What makes you battle against
the Barians, Shark?

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.046
I want to make them pay
for what they did

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:42.015
to me and my sister.

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:43.717
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:45.885
I assume that your
philosophy prevents you

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.955
from bringing emotions
into a duel?

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:53.727
I duel for myself
and only for myself, period.

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.362
Not true.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.374
Rio, are you sure this is
where the ruins are?

00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:08.975
The coordinates say it is.

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:11.378
This is definitely the place!

00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:16.850
Come.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.817
Hey... Rio!

00:04:17.817 --> 00:04:21.821
Rio, what's the matter?

00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:23.390
Nothing.

00:04:24.657 --> 00:04:27.293
I believe it would be wise to
leave this area

00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:28.361
at least for the time being.

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:30.697
Yeah me, too.
(Tori)
Guys!

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:31.364
There's something wrong.

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:34.000
The ship's
power's shutting down!

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:48.248
It appears our airship is going
to stay right where it is.

00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.016
(Abyss) Come...

00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:52.385
Come!

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.222
Who are you...
Show yourself now!

00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:57.090
Why are you calling?

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.858
What do you want from me?

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:01.394
Wait... Who're you
talking to?

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:04.664
What's up with the lights?

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.232
Rio, what is it?

00:05:06.232 --> 00:05:08.301
Come...

00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:11.371
Come to me now.

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:14.374
The lights are back!

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:18.244
Something feels different now.

00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:19.746
Rio!

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:21.080
Rio!

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.348
Rio!

00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:25.652
Shark, look at the monitor!

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:29.389
Rio.

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.633
Why would she go out on
the deck of the ship like that?

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.836
Shark, be careful!

00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.370
Come...

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:50.610
Come to me...

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:54.380
Rio!

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:01.921
Rio!

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.626
Shark, no!

00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:17.971
No, Yuma!

00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:22.809
Shark... Rio!

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.311
Yuma!

00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.014
Yuma!

00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:35.688
Yuma!

00:06:40.393 --> 00:06:42.328
(Shark) Yuma...

00:06:42.328 --> 00:06:43.363
Yuma!

00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:46.065
Wake up, Yuma!

00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:50.370
I guess I must've blacked out
for a while there.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.372
Where are we?

00:06:52.372 --> 00:06:54.007
I am not certain.

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:55.375
I, too, lost consciousness

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.377
when we were drawn into
the whirlpool.

00:06:57.377 --> 00:06:58.878
However, it appears that we are

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:01.814
beneath the bottom of
the ocean.

00:07:01.814 --> 00:07:05.318
So the ocean's, like, the sky?

00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:08.288
And these footprints...

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:10.356
Rio's here too.

00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:21.367
Whoa, check it out.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.736
That thing's enormous.

00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:36.382
What do you think this is?

00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:40.853
Perhaps this place is some
type of labyrinth.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.092
Look!

00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:50.229
Come on, let's see.

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.066
My dad's coins.

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:55.368
The Numbers must be here.

00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:05.078
Rio has some kind
of mysterious power.

00:08:05.078 --> 00:08:07.380
She can see things that
you and I can't,

00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:10.383
just like
before on the airship.

00:08:10.617 --> 00:08:12.185
I wouldn't be surprised one bit

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:14.654
if what she saw led her
to this place.

00:08:14.654 --> 00:08:19.659
I wish she could've seen
something a little less spooky.

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:22.061
(Abyss) Come...

00:08:31.204 --> 00:08:33.806
Rio's card.

00:08:36.142 --> 00:08:37.910
Hey... Yuma!

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.646
What's happening?

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:47.353
Man, it feels like this
labyrinth goes on forever.

00:08:47.353 --> 00:08:48.755
I doubt we will find the exit

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:51.691
if we continue to wander
aimlessly.

00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:53.826
Well good thing I have a plan!

00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:54.827
According to the book,

00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:56.362
"3rd Grade Mazes Solved Easily"

00:08:56.596 --> 00:08:59.365
all you have to do is
keep making lefts.

00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:00.199
Or was it rights?

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:02.101
I dunno, I never finished
the book.

00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:05.204
With you, Yuma, there are
no left or rights,

00:09:05.204 --> 00:09:06.105
only wrongs.

00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:10.209
Well, Shark'll
know how to get out, right?

00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:12.378
Where'd he go?

00:09:12.612 --> 00:09:14.947
Hey, Shark!

00:09:14.947 --> 00:09:16.883
Yo... Shark!

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:19.052
Shark!

00:09:19.052 --> 00:09:20.153
Something's weird here.

00:09:20.153 --> 00:09:23.389
We went back the exact same
way we came in,

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:25.058
but we still
can't find the entrance!

00:09:25.058 --> 00:09:26.926
I am afraid
that the normal rules

00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:29.328
do not apply in this labyrinth.

00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:32.365
Unfortunately, we have been
walking in circles

00:09:32.598 --> 00:09:34.901
this whole time.
Say what?

00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:36.369
It is a fact.

00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:38.604
I never forget what
I have seen.

00:09:38.604 --> 00:09:42.375
We have already passed this
particular mark three times.

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:43.776
But then
that means the entrance

00:09:43.776 --> 00:09:45.311
just disappeared somehow!

00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:47.280
That is what it means.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.715
That is not good!

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:51.851
Well, if this place won't obey
the laws of physics,

00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:54.320
then neither will I!

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.089
Here goes!

00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:01.394
Wait, Yuma.

00:10:01.594 --> 00:10:05.364
Look up ahead!
