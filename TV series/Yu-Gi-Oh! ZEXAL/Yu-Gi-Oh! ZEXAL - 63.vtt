00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.022
(Kite)
The time has come, Hart.

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:15.222
I made it through
to the semifinals.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:19.522
It won't be long now
'til I collect...

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:21.056
Master Kite,
please!

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.989
You can't continue
hunting Numbers.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.689
If you do, I'm afraid
of what might happen...

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.222
I'm not gonna stop until
I've made Vetrix

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.256
pay for what he's
done, got that?

(Mr. Heartland)
<i>In our first
semifinals duel,</i>

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:35.322
<i>the winner was
an unexpected one.</i>

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:38.856
<i>The underdog duelist:
Yuma Tsukumo!</i>

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.422
Keep it up, Yuma!

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.622
Yay!

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.489
Alright!

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:47.589
Yuma will take on the winner of
the upcoming semifinals duel.

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:51.922
Now let's meet the two who'll
fight in our next faceoff!

00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:53.489
<i>With a past shrouded
in mystery,</i>

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:56.122
<i>not much is known about him
except that his dueling skills</i>

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:58.289
<i>leave the competition
speechless!</i>

00:01:58.322 --> 00:02:01.789
<i>Give it up for the masked
dueling marvel-- Vetrix!</i>

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.089
And ready
to face him.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:06.522
A remarkable
young man,

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.389
said to have never lost
a match in his life.

00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:13.089
Put your hands
together for Kite Tenjo!

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.389
Hart and I are
counting on you.

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:20.122
Don't let
us down Kite.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:23.689
You do want to help your little
brother Hart, don't you?

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.856
(Yuma)Kite!

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:34.256
I'm totally rootin'
for you to win.

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.889
Cause "A", I want to take
you on one more time,

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:39.756
and "B", Vetrix
is a real creep.

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.189
So duel the pants
off 'em will ya?

00:02:42.222 --> 00:02:45.089
Hello Astral.

00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:47.589
Did he say Astral?

00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:50.622
I'm listening.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.622
I'll see you and Yuma
in the finals.

00:02:57.922 --> 00:03:00.156
He did mention
me right?

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.122
Good catching up!

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:04.289
(Mr. Heartland)
<i>Now that both duelists
have arrived,</i>

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:06.089
<i>we'll elevate
the stakes</i>

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:08.256
<i>and take this duel
to the next level</i>

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.789
<i>in our state of
the art Sky Field!</i>

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.489
This I gotta see!

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:22.089
Yuma, where
are you going?

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:23.956
(Yuma)
To get a good view!

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.122
Help, get me up!

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:36.256
Yuma, get lost!

00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:39.622
Help him up Orbital.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:41.822
Let 'em see how
a real champion duels.

00:03:44.363 --> 00:03:46.697
<i>The Duel of the Century
is about to commence!</i>

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.930
<i>But who will go
home the winner?</i>

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:51.930
<i>Will it be Vetrix,
or will it be Kite?</i>

00:03:51.963 --> 00:03:55.597
<i>If I had a seat,
I'd be on its edge!</i>

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.230
Go Kite,
let 'em have it!

00:03:57.263 --> 00:03:58.897
Yes. "Let 'em
have it,"

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.897
as cautiously and
carefully as you can.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.697
Oh dear.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.930
(Vetrix laughing)

00:04:04.963 --> 00:04:06.330
(Kite)
What's so funny?

00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:10.863
(Vetrix)
I just find it
so very amusing

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:13.763
that my nemesis is
spying on me right now.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:15.730
But try as
he might,

00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:19.963
he can't manage to
cloak his presence.

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:21.997
<i>I know you're
watching, Faker!</i>

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.963
<i>I do hope you're
enjoying the show!</i>

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.297
Vetrix, or
rather Byron.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.197
It's hard to
believe you returned.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.130
Even more curious
is that your body

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:33.630
took on such a
peculiar form.

00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:36.830
But your childlike shape and
size are unimportant to me.

00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:40.063
What is important however
is seeing you crushed!

00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:42.897
(Kite)
Vetrix this moment
is long overdue.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.130
I'm here to avenge what
you've done to my brother, Hart.

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:47.997
This I promise.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.897
So get ready
for some payback!

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.597
(Vetrix)
Now, now,
temper temper.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.963
What if I told
you that I have

00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.963
a special surprise
just for you?

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:58.030
Would that cheer
you up a bit?

00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.797
Enough of
your nonsense!

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.897
Go!

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.130
Photon Transformation!

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.963
(Computer Voice)
<i>Augmented Reality
Vision Link established.</i>

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:28.630
Let's Duel!
Let's Duel!

00:05:28.663 --> 00:05:31.530
I think I'll start
things off, Vetrix!

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.563
Here goes!

00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:36.230
I summon Photon
Crusher.

00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:44.130
Then I'll equip
Photon Crusher with this!

00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:46.197
The spell
Photon Spear!

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.430
Prepare for punishment

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:49.830
because the monster
equipped with Photon Spear

00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:52.730
counts as two monsters
instead of one!

00:05:55.997 --> 00:05:59.263
Photon Crusher just became
double the trouble.

00:05:59.297 --> 00:06:03.997
(Kite)
Now I tribute
my two Photon Crushers!

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:12.697
I summon the mighty
Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!

00:06:29.363 --> 00:06:30.430
What's with him?

00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:32.930
M-m-master Kite?

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.430
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:40.163
It's your move.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.163
My, it seems
your little

00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:46.830
Photon Transformation
nonsense is quite taxing.

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:49.297
You're not in very
good shape, are you?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.463
Actually, that's
putting it lightly.

00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:55.363
I'm surprised you're
still standing!

00:06:57.263 --> 00:06:59.030
What's going on?

00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:01.197
Kite's okay, right?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.563
No comment!

00:07:02.597 --> 00:07:03.897
It's my turn!

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.097
I draw!

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.597
I summon Heraldic
Beast Basilisk!

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:20.630
Next, I'll equip the
spell Heraldry Blast

00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:23.430
onto your Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon!

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.263
What?

00:07:26.297 --> 00:07:28.797
Why'd he equip Kite's
monster with his own spell?

00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:44.430
Heraldic
Beast Basilisk!

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:47.097
Attack Kite's
Galaxy-Eyes!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.963
Wait, hold on!

00:07:49.997 --> 00:07:52.130
Basilisk has only
1,000 attack points.

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:56.363
It's no match for Galaxy-Eyes
and its 3,000 attack points!

00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:57.397
Good math.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.697
But due to Basilisk's
special ability,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.430
if Basilisk
is destroyed,

00:08:01.463 --> 00:08:04.697
so is the monster
that's battling it.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.230
Now when Kite's Galaxy-Eyes
Photon Dragon is destroyed,

00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:11.430
Kite here takes half its
attack points as damage!

00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:12.830
I hate to
admit it,

00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:15.463
but even Kite may not be strong
enough to take down Vetrix.

00:08:15.497 --> 00:08:18.397
And now Kite, prepare for the
beginning of your end!

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.710
And now Kite, prepare for the
beginning of your end!

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:26.977
(Kite)
I don't think so!

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.110
Because I'm stopping
that attack!

00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:32.510
I activate Galaxy-Eyes'
special ability!

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:35.510
Both of our monsters
are now banished.

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:37.077
By banishing
Galaxy-Eyes,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.744
he removed Heraldry
Blast from his monster.

00:08:39.777 --> 00:08:42.177
Quite incredible
I must admit.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.410
Aww, yeah,
you go Kite.

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:45.844
(Kite)
Now that the
battle is over,

00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:48.810
both our monsters
return to the field!

00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:56.110
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:08:57.977 --> 00:08:59.110
Well done Kite.

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:01.444
I admit your dueling
is quite impressive.

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:02.844
Amazing in fact,

00:09:02.877 --> 00:09:06.310
considering the sorry state
your body is in at the moment.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:08.710
Putting your own health at
risk and hunting Numbers

00:09:08.744 --> 00:09:11.710
to save your brother--
how valiant of you, Kite.

00:09:11.744 --> 00:09:14.010
Yours is such
a noble goal.

00:09:14.044 --> 00:09:17.044
I also have a little
goal of my own.

00:09:17.077 --> 00:09:18.877
I've sworn to
have my vengeance

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.310
on your father,
Dr. Faker!

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:24.077
I'm not sure
you know this,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.210
but it was Faker
who betrayed me,

00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:30.877
leaving me adrift in the
limbo between two worlds.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:36.344
As a result, my body took the
form you see here today.

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:41.977
Byron ceased to be
and Vetrix was born.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.610
It was at that moment
that I was consumed

00:09:44.644 --> 00:09:46.877
<i>by a single
minded objective:</i>

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.144
<i>to take my revenge
on your father!</i>

00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:51.877
Revenge is my
reason for being,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.710
and I'll sacrifice anything
at my disposal to obtain it.

00:09:55.744 --> 00:09:59.810
You mean anything or anyone--
even your son, Quinton!

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:03.110
Oh, don't be so
self-righteous.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.444
In your pursuit
of Numbers,

00:10:04.477 --> 00:10:09.210
you've sacrificed
countless human souls!

00:10:09.244 --> 00:10:12.410
Of course you did it all for
your dear little brother Hart.

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:14.244
But never the less,
my point is clear.

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:15.677
Even though our
motives are different,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.910
you and
I are alike.

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:20.010
Whoa, did you
hear that?

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:22.710
I'm nothing
like you.

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:25.777
Being compared to you and even
looking at you make me sick.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.144
So I'm gonna skip straight
to beating you!

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:29.277
Now it's my turn!

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.544
I draw!

00:10:30.577 --> 00:10:34.277
I summon
Photon Satellite!

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.444
This card gains
the level

00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:38.310
of any Photon
monster on my field.

00:10:38.344 --> 00:10:40.144
Like Galaxy-Eyes.

00:10:40.177 --> 00:10:41.710
It's Level 8.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:45.777
So now Photon Satellite
becomes Level 9!

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.744
And when I use Photon
Satellite to Xyz Summon,

00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:54.444
it counts as
two monsters.

00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:58.677
So I overlay my two
Level 9 Photon Satellites!

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.644
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:06.810
And Xyz Summon...

00:11:06.844 --> 00:11:08.077
Number 9!

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.844
Dyson Sphere!

00:11:28.277 --> 00:11:30.410
What is that thing?

00:11:41.977 --> 00:11:44.644
How did Kite come
to have this card?

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:46.810
I got it from Quinton!

00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:49.677
Your own son will help
lead to your downfall.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.410
I equip Galaxy-Eyes
with Photon Wing

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:55.677
to further strengthen my
Dyson Sphere strategy.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.477
I activate Photon
Wing's effect!

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.644
Now once per turn,

00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:03.944
I can select an Xyz
Monster on my field!

00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:06.144
I choose
Dyson Sphere!

00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:07.444
So now my Galaxy-Eyes

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:11.410
absorbs all of Dyson
Sphere's Overlay Units!

00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:16.410
And it gains attack points
equal to Dyson Sphere's Rank

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.710
multiplied
by 200 points.

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.644
Dyson Sphere
is rank 9.

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:23.977
So Galaxy-Eyes gains
1800 attack points!

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.577
To make things
worse for you,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.544
Photon Wing allows Galaxy-Eyes
to attack you directly!

00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.877
So that'll mean a direct attack
with 4800 attack points!

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.044
Awesome!

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:35.644
He'll win the
duel for sure!

00:12:35.677 --> 00:12:39.210
And Master Kite will be able
to rest till the next duel.

00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:40.844
Now this is
it Galaxy-Eyes.

00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:44.510
Attack Vetrix with Photon
Stream of Destruction!

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.077
Unbelievable.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.444
It's over.

00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:06.410
(Vetrix laughing)

00:13:11.277 --> 00:13:12.910
What, this
can't be.

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:14.844
How can you have
any life points left?

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.810
Yeah, what's going
on here, huh?

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:20.144
How is it that Vetrix
is still standing?

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.910
(Astral)
There is the reason.

00:13:23.944 --> 00:13:26.844
He activated the trap
Heraldry Change.

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:29.877
Heraldry Change allows me to
summon a Heraldic Beast,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.644
and then I take 1000
points less damage

00:13:32.677 --> 00:13:34.910
for every Level
that monster has.

00:13:34.944 --> 00:13:37.744
I summoned Heraldic
Beast Aberconway,

00:13:37.777 --> 00:13:39.544
which is Level 4.

00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:45.077
So you decreased the damage
you'd take by 4000 points.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.744
Yes, are you shocked?

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:49.710
Because I assure you you
haven't seen anything yet.

00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:52.677
Because Kite, I've been
saving a little surprise

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.310
for you all
this time.

00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:59.811
And it'll take this duel
to a whole new level!

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.547
Ready for your
surprise, Kite?

00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:15.081
(Vetrix/Hart)
Why do you keep
attacking me?

00:14:15.114 --> 00:14:18.281
It hurts, Kite.

00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:21.847
This is all your
fault, big brother.

00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:30.947
You promised you would
help me get better Kite,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.580
but I've gotten
a lot worse.

00:14:32.613 --> 00:14:34.413
Just look at me!

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:35.980
This is all
kinds of weird.

00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:38.847
Yes, you are correct.

00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:43.847
What madness is this?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.647
(Kite)
Vetrix, I knew
you were low

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.180
but I didn't know how much
lower you could sink.

00:14:48.213 --> 00:14:49.680
But by hiding behind
my kid brother,

00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:51.413
you've hit
rock bottom.

00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:52.680
So that's it.

00:14:52.713 --> 00:14:56.080
I won't stand for
this anymore!

00:14:56.113 --> 00:14:57.513
Are you angry?

00:14:57.547 --> 00:14:58.980
Vetrix, stop
playing games.

00:14:59.013 --> 00:15:00.213
I'm not Vetrix.

00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:01.680
It's me your
brother, Hart.

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:03.413
Stop pretending
to be Hart!

00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:04.880
Oh no, you've
got it wrong.

00:15:04.913 --> 00:15:06.313
I'm not playing
make believe.

00:15:06.347 --> 00:15:09.613
I'm really Hart,
and Hart is me!

00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:11.813
(Vetrix/Hart)
<i>Remember when
I kidnapped Hart?</i>

00:15:11.847 --> 00:15:14.113
<i>How silly of me,
of course you do.</i>

00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:15.713
<i>Well, when
that happened</i>

00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:19.147
<i>I absorbed all of Hart's
power and memories!</i>

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.680
Impossible!

00:15:20.713 --> 00:15:21.947
No, it's true.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.247
Our minds joined together
and we became one.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.780
I'll prove it,
look up here!

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:29.347
Hart, it's me!

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.213
Save your breath,
he can't hear you.

00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:34.080
Now say for instance I give
myself a little pinch.

00:15:34.113 --> 00:15:35.847
Hart can feel it too!

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.447
Stop, Vetrix!

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.980
My dear boy.

00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:43.880
Someone get to Hart's room
and check on him now!

00:15:43.913 --> 00:15:45.780
(Dr. Faker)
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.413
We're locked out!

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:52.280
We can't access
Hart's room!

00:15:52.313 --> 00:15:53.847
The door is jammed.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.213
He's gone too far.

00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:57.580
Vetrix must
be stopped.

00:15:57.613 --> 00:15:58.813
It hurts, Kite.

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:00.747
Can't you make
it stop, please?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.147
Listen up Vetrix.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.147
I 'm done playing this
silly game of yours--

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.747
this duel's over.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.047
I don't think so.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.713
This battle is just
getting started, Kite.

00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:18.180
(Vetrix)
Didn't you hear me?

00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:20.180
I wish I didn't have
to force you to duel,

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:22.580
but you've simply
left me no other choice.

00:16:22.613 --> 00:16:23.813
Hey Kite!

00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:25.547
I'll find Hart and
free him from Vetrix.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.713
You just stay here,

00:16:26.747 --> 00:16:30.147
and work on making sure
you win this duel, okay?

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.547
I plan on it.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.247
Come on, Orbital!

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.813
Aye Aye Captain!

00:16:38.513 --> 00:16:39.613
Hang on Hart!

00:16:39.647 --> 00:16:41.713
Here we
cooooooooome!

00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:50.047
Yuma is such a pest.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.147
Now where were we?

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.347
Oh, yes,
it's my turn.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.280
I draw!

00:16:57.313 --> 00:17:02.547
I overlay Level
4 Aberconway and Basilisk!

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.013
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:08.847
And Xyz Summon
Number 8:

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.747
Heraldic King
Genom-Heritage!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.413
So Vetrix is dueling
with a Number Card.

00:17:23.447 --> 00:17:25.947
Now I activate Heraldic
King Genom-Heritage's

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.613
special ability!

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:29.380
By using one
Overlay Unit,

00:17:29.413 --> 00:17:33.080
I can select one of its
three special abilities.

00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:35.213
When Genom-Heritage
battles your monster,

00:17:35.247 --> 00:17:37.747
your monster's attack
points drop to 0

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.213
until the end
of the turn.

00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:42.180
Oh, and where do those
attack points go?

00:17:42.213 --> 00:17:45.947
They become Genom-Heritage's
attack points.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.880
Your monster will
be unstoppable.

00:17:47.913 --> 00:17:49.180
Yes, that's right.

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:51.880
And now I'll
attack Dyson Sphere!

00:18:04.613 --> 00:18:07.880
(Vetrix/Hart)
Dyson Sphere's attack
points have dropped to zero.

00:18:07.913 --> 00:18:13.013
And my Genom-Heritage's
attack points soar to 2800.

00:18:13.047 --> 00:18:15.280
That move may not work
out the way you'd hoped.

00:18:15.313 --> 00:18:17.280
Because If you
attack Dyson Sphere

00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:19.513
when it has
no Overlay Units,

00:18:19.547 --> 00:18:22.213
it gets back all the
Overlay Units it lost

00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:24.780
and then stops any attack
you may have started!

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.047
Oh, what a pity.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.613
I'll just have to use my
Number's second Overlay Unit

00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:30.680
to select its next
special ability!

00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:32.213
Remember how
Genom-Heritage

00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:33.980
stole your monster's
attack points?

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:38.347
Well, Genom-Heritage steals your
monster's special abilities.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.613
You've taken away all my
monster's powers.

00:18:40.647 --> 00:18:44.013
That's right, and now I'm
taking away your life points.

00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:48.747
Go, Genom-Heritage.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.213
Attack his
Dyson Sphere!

00:18:52.247 --> 00:18:54.547
Flash Impact!

00:19:24.213 --> 00:19:28.113
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:19:28.147 --> 00:19:30.613
That was fun.

00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:31.880
But the fun won't
stop there.

00:19:31.913 --> 00:19:34.347
Wait till you see what
I have in store next!

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.913
You see now we'll begin
to feel each attack,

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:39.813
so the stakes have just
gotten more interesting.

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:41.547
So when you
strike at me,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.847
you attack your poor,
defenseless little Hart.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.313
Ohh!

00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:49.380
Now what will I do?

00:19:49.413 --> 00:19:51.613
The real question you need
to ask yourself is:

00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:54.113
"Are you willing to
harm Hart to beat me"?

00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:55.280
I won't do it.

00:19:55.313 --> 00:19:56.647
I will never
hurt Hart!

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.547
Well looks like
you'll have to!

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.847
Just go easy on
me okay, Kite?

00:20:04.613 --> 00:20:07.213
I'm comin',
hang in there.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:10.047
I will rescue
you Hart!

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.180
Vetrix!

00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:13.680
<i>Enjoying
the show, Faker?</i>

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.413
<i>Ingenious, isn't it?</i>

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:16.880
<i>You're about to
watch both your sons</i>

00:20:16.913 --> 00:20:20.280
<i>get crushed
in the same duel.</i>

00:20:20.313 --> 00:20:23.213
And I won't go
easy on 'em either.

00:20:23.247 --> 00:20:26.547
(Vetrix laughing)
