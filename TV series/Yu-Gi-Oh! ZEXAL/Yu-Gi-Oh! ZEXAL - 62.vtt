WEBVTT

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.063
(Yuma)
Last time
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal"...

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:08.964
(man)
The opening duel of the
semi-final round will begin now!

00:00:08.997 --> 00:00:10.164
What's up with Shark?

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:11.730
He looks strange.

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:14.997
It is possible
Shark has become possessed.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.764
Shark summoned out
a Chaos Number

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:18.697
during his
battle with Quattro.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.230
The darkness within
that Number

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.497
was too much
for Shark to control.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.664
I believe it has overpowered
him completely now.

00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:27.930
Let's settle this...

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.064
once and for all,
Yuma!

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.530
That crest on his hand...

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.197
We've seen it before.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.330
It is the same crest that
belongs to Vetrix.

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:38.564
Then Shark isn't possessed
by a Number.

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:40.564
He's possessed by Vetrix!

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:42.264
You almost
have it right.

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:46.197
To be precise, Shark's soul has
been taken over by a Number.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.664
But it is
controlled by yours truly.

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:52.397
Because of this I also control
Shark now!

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.330
I'm going to get
revenge for my sister, Rio!

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:58.130
Spear Shark, attack Yuma
directly!

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.397
He's angry.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.364
But why
is he angry at me?

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:07.464
It's Vetrix!

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:09.330
He changed
Shark's memories!

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:11.530
I'll do whatever it takes
to win this duel!

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:13.064
Hopefully that
will restore Shark

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:14.630
back to his normal self!

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:17.397
I Xyz
Summon Number 32:

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.864
Shark Drake!

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:22.830

We have to stop
that Number!

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.164
It will be difficult.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.430
Yuma...

00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:44.430
I wouldn't wanna bump into that
thing at night.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.564
Or in the day!

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:47.830
Oh, wow!

00:02:47.864 --> 00:02:51.330
That monster has "mean" written
all over it!

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.664
It's magnificent!

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.630
I must have it!

00:02:57.664 --> 00:02:59.497
I know you, Faker.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.064
You're planning to seize control
of Shark Drake

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:03.197
and its power.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.197
But you don't
realize I have plans too.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.497
Show no mercy, Shark Drake!

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.164
Destroy Gogogo Ghost with
Deep Sea Destruction!

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.664
He will keep attacking!

00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:28.530
I know.

00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:31.797
I activate Shark Drake's
special ability!

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.230
By using
an Overlay Unit,

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:34.697
when it destroys
a monster,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.897
Shark Drake has the power
to summon it right back again,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.864
with 1,000 less attack points!

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:43.430
So Gogogo Ghost is comin' back
and I'm gonna take it out!

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.597
Looks like Shark's
double-dippin' on his attack!

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.397
Yuma better find
a way to stop him quick!

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.030
You only have 900 life
points left.

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:56.330
Once I finish
off your Gogogo Ghost,

00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:57.764
you're finished, too!

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:00.030
Get it
done, Shark Drake!

00:04:00.064 --> 00:04:03.464
Finish off Yuma
and his monster!

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.964
That finished him off
for sure!

00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:15.597
I can't believe it.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.030
What's this?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.430
Yuma took his monsters
and made a switcheroo!

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.564
Great move!

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:29.097
He still has a chance to pull
this out!

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.764
How were you able to bring
out Gogogo Golem?

00:04:32.797 --> 00:04:35.330
I had to play my cards
just right.

00:04:35.364 --> 00:04:37.364
You see Gogogo Ghost's
special ability

00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:39.330
let me
summon Gogogo Golem

00:04:39.364 --> 00:04:40.664
from my graveyard.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.697
When that happened,
Gogogo Ghost got moved

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.330
into defense mode.

00:04:44.364 --> 00:04:46.430
Even though it was destroyed
by Shark Drake,

00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:49.397
I was protected
and didn't take any damage!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.730
So that's
how you survived.

00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:55.430
But I'll defeat you
on my next turn.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:56.864
Most impressive, Yuma!

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.830
That was genius!

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.564
Of course it was probably
Astral's idea.

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:04.130
Please Yuma,
hang in there!

00:05:04.164 --> 00:05:05.230
Not bad.

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:07.264
But still
not good enough.

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:10.730
Reginald has completely reversed
the course of this duel.

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:14.297
Yuma will need to summon his
most powerful Number to survive.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.297
Which means...

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.864
I'll be able to see
Utopia's powers!

00:05:17.897 --> 00:05:18.964
Listen, Yuma...

00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:21.364
you must find
a way to summon Utopia.

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:23.297
It is our only
hope now.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.164
I was
thinkin' the same thing.

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:27.530
But I only have Golem
on my field.

00:05:27.564 --> 00:05:29.930
I need to draw
another Level 4 monster

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:31.564
to summon Utopia.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.097
Okay, here goes!

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.097
I draw!

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.964
No luck.

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:38.797
It's not
a monster card.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.264
Patience, Yuma.

00:05:40.297 --> 00:05:41.397
Patience?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.164
I don't have the patience
to be patient!

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.630
I gotta save Shark
before it's too late!

00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:48.164
C'mon, Shark--
Snap out of it!

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:51.230
Vetrix is controlling your mind,
but I know you can break free

00:05:51.264 --> 00:05:52.897
if you just think
back to all the duels

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.530
you and I fought
together!

00:05:54.564 --> 00:05:56.630
What are you
talking about?

00:05:56.664 --> 00:05:58.564
Don't you
remember our first duel?

00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:01.330
We battled for both Bronk's
deck and mine!

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:02.764
It was intense!

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:04.864
And then there was the
time we teamed up to duel

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.397
and you gave me a card
after we won!

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.497
(Shark)
I'm outta here.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.497
Wait up!

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.164
You're Armored Xyz.

00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:12.597
Don't you want it back?

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.730
Nah, keep it.

00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:15.197
You sure?
Yeah.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.764
You can use all
the help you can get.

00:06:17.797 --> 00:06:21.697
I'm the one who
helped you.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.530
Later.

00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:26.797
It meant a lot to me when
you gave me that card.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.897
'Cause I felt like we were
really starting to connect.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.930
And when Kite tried to
take my Golden Key,

00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:34.997
you dueled him to protect it!

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.130
Think back, Shark!

00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:38.097
Try to remember!

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.497
All those duels have helped me
see who the true you is, Shark!

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.664
And that person
is my friend!

00:06:44.697 --> 00:06:47.930
No... I'm not!

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:50.630
I don't wanna be friends
with anyone, Yuma...

00:06:50.664 --> 00:06:53.530
Especially not
with someone like you.

00:06:53.564 --> 00:06:56.097
The one thing I care about
is getting revenge.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.064
You're gonna pay
for hurting my sister!

00:07:00.097 --> 00:07:02.430
But I've had enough chitchat
for one day!

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.364
We're wasting time here!

00:07:04.397 --> 00:07:07.397
I came here to duel,
not to have a conversation!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.497
Hurry up and make
your move!

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.797
All right then.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.597
I'll have to let
my dueling speak for me!

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.830
First, I'm changing
Gogogo Golem

00:07:16.864 --> 00:07:20.164
from defense to attack mode!

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:24.430
And then, I'll pump up its power
with the spell Golden Form!

00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:28.030
When my Gogogo Golem switches
from defense to attack mode,

00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:31.597
this spell doubles its attack
points until my next turn.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.497
<i>(man)
Whoa!</i>

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.497
<i>Break out those sunglasses,
folks!</i>

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.730
<i>That is the glitziest
Golem I've ever seen!</i>

00:07:41.764 --> 00:07:44.264
But even if it's powered-up,
its still not a Number

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.197
so it can't
take out Shark Drake!

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.830
Yeah, so why did Yuma
use the spell?

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.630
Yuma...

00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:52.364
I know what I'm doing.

00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:54.364
Even though I can't
destroy Shark's Number,

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:56.997
my attack will still
pack a punch!

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.830
Maybe the impact will
be enough to bring Shark

00:07:58.864 --> 00:08:00.697
back to his senses!

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.064
Now, Gogogo Golem!

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:04.164
Attack Shark Drake!

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:05.964
Gogogo Gust!

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:18.097
Shark,
snap out of it!

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.964
C'mon, Shark!

00:08:20.997 --> 00:08:22.464
<i>Very clever!</i>

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:26.230
<i>Yuma just threw Shark a
curve and got a solid strike!</i>

00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:28.330
<i>He didn't even scratch
Shark's Number,</i>

00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:32.130
<i>but suddenly both duelists
are down to 900 life points!</i>

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:34.997
You can't take down my Number,
so you're tryin'

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.030
to drain my
life points instead.

00:08:37.064 --> 00:08:38.964
Only it's too late.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.297
Well, we'll see about
that, Shark.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.664
Take your turn!

00:08:44.697 --> 00:08:45.930
If you insist!

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:47.264
I draw!

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:48.464
It's time.

00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:52.797
I just wish my sister
were here to see this moment.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.030
But she can't be,
thanks to you!

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.730
(woman)
Hey, why's he glowin'?

00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:06.930
(girl)
Is there something wrong
with him?

00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:09.530
Now go!

00:09:09.564 --> 00:09:11.930
By combining Shark Drake
with its Overlay Units,

00:09:11.964 --> 00:09:13.897
it can further
evolve itself!

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.630
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:24.697
Behold the dreaded
Chaos Number 32...

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.158
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.930
Whoa!

00:09:35.964 --> 00:09:37.464
What is that?

00:09:37.497 --> 00:09:39.330
That thing doesn't
look friendly!

00:09:39.364 --> 00:09:42.964
Oh, no...

00:09:42.997 --> 00:09:45.364
How can we
stop that thing?

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:47.697
I am not sure we can...

00:10:00.672 --> 00:10:02.705
Shark summoned
his Chaos Number!

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.572
The chances of
us winning this duel

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:06.705
do not appear to
be promising.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:08.639
At last!

00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:12.872
Now... Shark Drake Veiss,
use your special ability!

00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:15.839
It uses an Overlay Unit
to banish a Shark monster

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:17.672
from my graveyard.

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:19.739
Good-bye Spear Shark!

00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:24.272
Now its 1,600 attack points get
deducted from Gogogo Golem!

00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:25.872
You must stop this!

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:27.072
I will!

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:31.472
By activating my Power Change
Barrier trap!

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:35.505
Now Gogogo's attack points
get reduced by 600.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:38.139
It's a small price to pay,
'cause the trap cancels out

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.505
Shark Drake Veiss's
special ability!

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.672
Nice defense!

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.139
That Chaos Number has
more Overlay Units,

00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:46.972
so Yuma's
still in trouble!

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:49.639
I'll do it all over
again, Yuma!

00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:52.439
I use an Overlay Unit to
banish Double Shark,

00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:54.805
so I can
weaken your monster!

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:57.939
Double Shark, get
that Golem!

00:10:57.972 --> 00:11:00.205
That's not gonna happen
as long as I keep activating

00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:02.472
my Power Change Barrier!

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:05.939
Shark Drake Veiss's special
ability is negated again!

00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:11.805
I still have one Overlay Unit
left, so I can strike again!

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:15.039
This time, I banish
Shark Drake from my graveyard!

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:20.825
Which means your Gogogo Golem
will lose 2,800 attack points!

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:22.505
Not yet!

00:11:22.539 --> 00:11:27.339
I still have
my trap!

00:11:27.372 --> 00:11:28.605
So what?

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.205
My Shark Drake Veiss has one
thousand more attack points

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:32.772
than your feeble Golem.

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:35.072
This next strike
will end the duel!

00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:37.639
Attack, Shark Drake Veiss!

00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:39.705
Destroy that Golem!

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:44.205
Chaos Stream!

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:50.172
I activate my trap...
Half Unbreak!

00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:54.372
It saves Gogogo Golem
from destruction!

00:11:54.405 --> 00:11:57.572
And the damage
I take is cut in half.

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:04.572
Oh, no!

00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:07.005
You've survived everything
I've thrown at you...

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:10.072
but I saved
the best for last!

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.672
On my next turn, you're
gonna lose!

00:12:12.705 --> 00:12:14.939
I'm putting
one card facedown.

00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:16.205
It's your move!

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:18.572
(Vetrix)
If Yuma was wise,
he'd stay down.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.139
He doesn't have
a chance.

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.539
It's over.

00:12:21.572 --> 00:12:25.172
The card that I gave Shark
as a present is too powerful.

00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:28.739
Yuma will be finished
once and for all!

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:33.005
We are down to
400 life points.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:35.172
This is our last
chance.

00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:36.539
I know.

00:12:36.572 --> 00:12:39.272
But I'm counting on my deck
to help me win this turn.

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:42.372
I gotta draw...
the perfect card.

00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:44.772
I'm feelin' the flow!

00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:48.405
I did it!

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:50.872
I summon Gagaga Magician!

00:12:55.972 --> 00:13:01.472
I overlay my Level 4 Gagaga
Magician and Gogogo Golem!

00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:04.339
With these two monsters
I build the Overlay Network

00:13:04.372 --> 00:13:08.339
and Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:20.272
Nice work!

00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:24.072
Except your Utopia only
has 2,500 attack points,

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:27.172
so it isn't strong enough to
overpower my Chaos Number!

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:28.839
If Utopia tries to attack,

00:13:28.872 --> 00:13:31.572
it's the one that's gonna
get destroyed!

00:13:34.472 --> 00:13:35.605
That's not true!

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.939
Utopia will survive.

00:13:37.972 --> 00:13:40.672
And so will
your Chaos Number!

00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:42.405
What?

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:44.872
I'm fighting this duel
to save you!

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.939
But that doesn't
mean I don't want to win.

00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:49.905
It's important that I become the
World Duel Carnival champion,

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:52.439
so I can stop
Dr. Faker and Vetrix!

00:13:52.472 --> 00:13:55.472
But it's also important to free
you from the control Vetrix

00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.405
has on your mind!

00:13:57.439 --> 00:14:01.105
I'll do whatever it takes
to help my friends,

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.005
especially one
of my best friends...

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:04.072
You!

00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:07.739
This will work!

00:14:07.772 --> 00:14:09.105
Okay, Utopia...

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:11.805
Attack
Shark Drake Veiss!

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.039
Rising Sun Slash!

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.639
Instead of trying
the same old strategy,

00:14:18.672 --> 00:14:20.705
you should use a little
imagination!

00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:23.439
And that's why
you're always a failure!

00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:25.905
Go Chaos Stream!

00:14:28.872 --> 00:14:31.439
I'll use an Overlay Unit
to activate...

00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:34.039
...Utopia's special ability!

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:39.105
It can stop
its own attack!

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:40.272
Hang on!

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:42.005
Utopia stopped
its own attack?

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.072
Are you ready?

00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:44.872
I am!

00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:48.605
I'm activating my trap
Rivals Unite, right now!

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.205
Since Utopia stopped its
attack, this card equips

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:56.231
on to your monster, and I get
to take control of it!

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.039
No-- You can't!

00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:06.172
Leave Shark at once,
hear that Shark Drake Veiss?

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:09.405
I order you to enter
my soul instead!

00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:19.426
(Yuma)
Shark Drake Veiss...

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.560
Leave Shark
and enter my soul!

00:15:32.993 --> 00:15:34.493
You're free
from the Number!

00:15:34.526 --> 00:15:38.093
Now try to remember the truth
about the past!

00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:41.426
You're a good duelist.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.693
I'll see ya around.

00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:44.593
Aw, come on!

00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:46.726
I thought
we were friends!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.426
Don't go.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.826
Yuma, you and I
are finished.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.693
So don't you ever
come bothering me again.

00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:57.093
I'm not gonna step aside and let
you throw your life away, Shark!

00:15:57.126 --> 00:15:59.760
You're my friend, Shark,
and I don't wanna see you

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.693
destroy yourself with hate.

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.760
I finally remember, Yuma...

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.626
You're not the one responsible
for what happened to my sister.

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:14.993
Vetrix was behind
everything.

00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:17.093
He's the one who's guilty!

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:18.326
It was him!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.126
He's planted that Number
in my soul and made me forget!

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.460
Yuma!

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.226
No!

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.793
Yuma!

00:16:29.826 --> 00:16:31.526
(Vetrix)
It's too late
for Yuma!

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.960
Soon his soul will be completely
consumed by Shark Drake Veiss!

00:16:40.926 --> 00:16:42.226
Yuma!

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.326
If he truly
is your friend,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.626
you'll want to help him
of course.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.126
What can I do?

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.126
Ah, so you remember.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.460
You just have to use
the trap card I gave you...

00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:59.793
Heraldry Catastrophe!

00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:01.093
Don't worry, Yuma.

00:17:01.126 --> 00:17:02.493
Shark will save you!

00:17:02.526 --> 00:17:03.693
Vetrix!

00:17:03.726 --> 00:17:05.826
Since you took control
of Shark Drake Veiss,

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.993
Shark can now activate
his facedown card.

00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:12.360
It is a trap called
Heraldry Catastrophe.

00:17:12.393 --> 00:17:14.993
Since you now control
Shark's monster,

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.993
this trap destroys it...

00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:19.226
Along with all your
monsters that have equal

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.860
or fewer attack points.

00:17:20.893 --> 00:17:24.260
So that means that Shark Drake
Veiss and your Utopia

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.826
will both be wiped out!

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.926
Wiped out?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.926
No way!

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.293
Oh, and you'll
also take damage

00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:32.293
equal to those monsters'
attack points.

00:17:32.326 --> 00:17:35.226
That's a total
of 5,300 points!

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.493
So Shark, it's a win-win
for you:

00:17:37.526 --> 00:17:40.160
You free Yuma from
Shark Drake Veiss ' control,

00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:41.760
and you win the duel!

00:17:41.793 --> 00:17:44.760
Am I brilliant or what?

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.926
I expected Yuma to
take over your monster

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.460
and that's why I gave you
the trap!

00:17:49.493 --> 00:17:53.593
Your victory is guaranteed!

00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:56.793
If Utopia gets destroyed,
Astral's a goner too!

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.360
I have to think...

00:17:59.393 --> 00:18:01.993
There must be
something I can do!

00:18:02.026 --> 00:18:03.626
Of course!

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.960
Traplin!

00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:07.526
All I have to do is destroy a
trap card on my field

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.726
to summon it!

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.093
That means I can
get rid of Rivals Unite!

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:14.226
Indeed.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.226
Shark Drake Veiss
will return to Shark,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.660
plus Utopia and I
will be saved.

00:18:18.693 --> 00:18:22.226
But Shark will once again be
controlled by that Number...

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.760
And ultimately
by Vetrix!

00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:26.326
So then I
have to choose...

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.893
between saving you or
saving Shark?

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:29.960
I can't!

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.093
Yuma!

00:18:36.126 --> 00:18:36.893
Quick!

00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:38.160
Use that trap card.

00:18:38.193 --> 00:18:40.826
It's the only way
you can help Yuma.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.460
Every second you hesitate,

00:18:42.493 --> 00:18:45.893
that Chaos Number tightens
its grip on Yuma's soul.

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:48.460
You must activate
Heraldry Catastrophe

00:18:48.493 --> 00:18:49.760
before it's too late.

00:18:49.793 --> 00:18:52.260
It will save your friend
and assure your victory!

00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:56.493
Yuma!

00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:58.060
I can't do it!

00:18:58.093 --> 00:19:00.626
I can't choose
between you!

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.226
You and Shark
are my friends!

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.593
I care about what happens
to both of you...

00:19:04.626 --> 00:19:07.426
and I don't want to
see either of you hurt!

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.926
Yuma!

00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:11.293
Wait!

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:15.126
There's that card I put facedown
at the start of the duel...

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.860
That's it!

00:19:16.893 --> 00:19:18.593
I activate
a spell...

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:21.060
Underwater Snow Prison!

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:25.993
I'll use it to put Shark Drake
Veiss on ice... and banish it!

00:19:33.584 --> 00:19:37.784
I activate a spell...
Underwater Snow Prison!

00:19:37.817 --> 00:19:40.517
I'll use it to put
Shark Drake Veiss on ice...

00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:42.451
and banish it!

00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:49.717
Using this spell
has a price.

00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:53.817
I take 1,000
points of damage.

00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:56.151
Shark, no!

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.151
(gasping)

00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:06.951
I... can't believe it.

00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:10.317
<i>Yuma Tsukumo wins
the duel.</i>

00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:13.017
Shark, are you okay?

00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:14.251
Shark!

00:20:14.284 --> 00:20:15.517
Please, answer!

00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:17.184
Tell me you're okay!

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.384
I'm fine.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.951
You saved me.

00:20:19.984 --> 00:20:22.384
My soul could have
been lost forever...

00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:25.684
but you never gave up
on our friendship.

00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:28.251
Vetrix tried to use me
to hurt you and Astral...

00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:31.917
But in the end, I never gave up
on our friendship either.

00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:33.751
Just promise me this...

00:20:33.784 --> 00:20:37.751
you'll defeat Vetrix
for good!

00:20:37.784 --> 00:20:39.017
Defeat me?

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:40.317
For good?

00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:43.451
I'll teach that twerp Yuma not
to meddle with my plans!

00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:49.484
Shark failed his mission, but
that won't make any difference.

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:50.951
After I defeat Kite,

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:56.251
I'll eliminate Yuma Tsukumo
once and for all!

00:20:56.284 --> 00:20:59.217
(Astral)
Shark lost the duel
to save us.

00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:00.584
I know.

00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:01.951
When it was all on the line,

00:21:01.984 --> 00:21:04.884
Shark proved
that he's a true friend.

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:06.851
He asked one thing
in return, though.

00:21:06.884 --> 00:21:08.317
Yeah.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.884
And if I do face Vetrix in the
finals, I won't let Shark down!

00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:15.651
I'll win it all
and high five the sky!
