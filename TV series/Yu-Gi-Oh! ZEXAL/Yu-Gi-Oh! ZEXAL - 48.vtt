WEBVTT

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.730
Last time on yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal...

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.590
YUMA: Hope I didn't keep
you waiting too long!

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.860
Trey: You'll wish you never came
here at all once you see the new

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430
power that I've acquired.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.230
Meeting your family and seeing
you together made me think,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.130
about my own family.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.990
I want to see them all
happy like they used to be.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.530
But I can't help them as long
as you're standing in my way!

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.360
TOGETHER: Let's duel!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.460
pfirst I'll see if the powers I
preceived from vetrix pay off.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.160
pit's incredible!

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.060
pi can see astral clearly!

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.190
What's wrong?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.690
I'm just trying my new Power on
for size, so I can destroy you!

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.660
Astral: Yuma!

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.060
My golden key!

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.660
What's going on?

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.160
Yuma, what is wrong?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.330
Tell me.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.830
I can't win this.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.630
It's totally impossible.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.390
His unstoppable
spirit no longer exists!

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.330
And what's more,
yuma cannot see you!

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.190
Yuma, you must not give
in to fear or doubt!

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.130
Listen!

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.760
You can't help him anymore!

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
You're through!

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.730
Now, machu mech!

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.730
Destroy Gagaga magician!

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.560
Yuma, please hear me!

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.730
It's done.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.460
I've separated yuma
and astral for good.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.460
Now, let's see if you've
got the guts to defeat me.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.290
Come on.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.690
I... I can't.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.830
I'm too scared.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.860
Stand up and fight me, yuma.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.560
It's your turn.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.190
I told you to stand up!

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.790
You coward!

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.160
No! I won't!

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.430
I'm not strong enough to take on
monsters as terrifying as yours!

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.930
Cathy: C'mon yuma!

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.430
Flip: What's he up to?

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.290
Caswell: What's wrong?

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.460
Bronk: Hey, yuma!

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.290
Will you quit goofin' around?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.590
Get it in gear!

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.860
You gotta draw a
new card like now!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.190
Oh Yeah. It's my turn.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.190
I hope I don't mess this up.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.330
Here I go.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.160
I summon...

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.160
I don't know which card to pick.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.890
Guess I'll just
forfeit the duel.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.430
Without the sense of adventure
you got from your father,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.830
you can't feel the flow!

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.930
I don't get it.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.560
What's wrong, yuma?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.330
I not only took your
friend's confidence,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.130
but his most
important ally, too.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.130
See for yourself!

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.030
TORI: It's astral!

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.430
What's he doin' up there?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.060
I used my new powers
to immobilize him!

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.090
And I also turned yuma
into a quivering coward!

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.530
What a lowdown move!

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.130
That guy's a real snake!

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.530
Yuma, you gotta
fight to free astral!

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.290
He's too cowardly to fight.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.530
Yuma's turned into a quitter.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.890
But if you think
I'm gonna let you off

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.460
the hook that easy,
you're wrong!

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.760
Cause I'd rather break you
and take everything from you.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.430
But Trey...

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.990
This is the end, yuma!

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.290
Of your last
duel ever!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.930
You're through!

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.530
Look out!

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.490
Yuma Can still pull through
'cause he's got gogogo golem.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.160
I don't think so
because I'm playing this!

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Chronomaly Mud golem!

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.530
Since Yuma's golem can't
be destroyed in battle

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.290
when it's in defense
mode, you guys thought

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.360
he was safe.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.890
But yuma's anything but safe!

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.890
Alright mud golem,
attack with Lectro laser!

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.060
Check this out, yuma!

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.160
Due to mud golem's
special ability,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.330
if it has more attack
points than your monster's

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.330
defense points, you take
the difference as damage!

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.130
Next up I'm using my
heart of stone spell card!

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.690
It lets my monster
do even more damage!

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.960
With this spell, if mud golem
failed to destroy your monster

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.960
in battle, it can attack again!

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.860
Okay, mud golem!

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.860
Take out gogogo golem
with another Laser blast!

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.830
Yuma!

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.230
Now to complete my victory!

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.960
It's time, machu mech!

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.960
Attack With Meteor meltdown!

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.860
Yuma!

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.330
I'll use the last of my
strength... to remind you...

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
you must feel the flow!

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.960
You must remember who
you truly are, yuma!

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.360
pwhat is all this
pstuff I'm seeing?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.360
pcan I really be this strong?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.130
I wonder if... yes!

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.390
I summon gagaga gardna!

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.290
Block that attack!

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.360
Block it?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.190
That's an incredible move!

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.860
Yuma was able to call
up gagaga gardna

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.860
'cause he's being
attacked directly!

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.160
Oh, no!

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.890
Yuma!

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.660
How did he think
to use that card?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.190
Of course!

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.230
Astral helped him.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.430
I have had it...

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.430
with your interfering!

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.330
He can't take it!

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.390
the energy's too intense!

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.690
Be gone!

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.760
Do not give up, yuma!

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.990
No!

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.830
Now you'll have to survive
this duel on your own, yuma.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.790
Hang on!

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.290
It's okay, bronk!

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.660
Don't forget,
this is all virtual.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.890
Even if yuma falls,
he won't really get hurt.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.360
Wrong, Caswell!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.960
If yuma let's go of the edge,
he's fallin' for real!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.760
Oh Yeah, that's right! Oh no!

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.060
How could I forget?

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.660
This place is actually a
superhighway that's under

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.190
construction over the ocean!

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.190
Yuma, hang on!

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.830
Gotcha!

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.630
Let's Reel him in, you guys!

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.190
Why are you guys helping me?

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.460
Cause we're your pals!

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.030
Don't you remember, yuma?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.730
But I thought none
of you liked me.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.130
Sure we do.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.490
A lot!

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.490
That's why we're friends!

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.290
And always will be!

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.160
Man, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.360
It looks like Trey's been
messin' with your memory bank!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.830
He's tryin' to make you believe
you're nothin' but a loser.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.060
But the real yuma doesn't let
anything stand in his way.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.960
You're the bravest guy that
I know and you never give up!

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.130
I'm trying to remember...
But I can't seem to...

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.460
I hate to interrupt
your powwow,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.460
but I need to do
some Crowd control!

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.690
And now,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.690
we can finally settle this yuma.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.730
Sorry, but as long as you're
trapped inside that prison,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.560
yuma can't hear you.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.860
You skunk!

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.860
Let us out!

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Yuma...

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.490
KAZUMA: It appears that
yuma's in grave jeopardy.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.960
His opponent has
devised a devious plan.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.030
Power alone won't be
enough to overcome it!

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.990
Yuma!

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.990
You must remember the most
important thing of all!

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.390
what?

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.090
And now yuma, remember!

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.090
Remember all that you
have learned from me!

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.430
pwait a minute...
pthat can't be me.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.430
pi'm not brave or bold LIKE
pthe yuma I'm seeing here...

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.860
por am I?

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.930
pdid I do those things?

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.530
Yuma!

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.560
Catch!

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.660
pyuma,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.660
premember everything
pi passed on to you!

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.060
premember who you truly are!

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.460
That's right.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.690
I'm not scared of any challenge.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.630
I just have to go for it!

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.630
I am feelin' the flow!

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.730
He's back to normal.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.160
It's True.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.730
I don't believe it.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.460
You broke the
power of the crest?

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.730
That's right.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.990
You can't erase the
things my father taught me.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.230
I can!

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.060
By erasing you just
like I did astral!

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.360
Whadya mean?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.560
Astral!

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.490
You tell me where astral is!

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.790
I already told you,
astral's been erased.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.490
What does that mean?

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.960
It means he's gone.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.130
And you'll never
see him again.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.130
No way!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.130
I don't believe you, Trey.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.030
Then you don't
believe your own eyes.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.430
You saw him vanish yourself.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.960
He never stood a chance.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.960
Unfortunately, my new Powers
WERE too much for astral.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.530
You're lying.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.560
That's not True!

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.330
It's just like all the other
lies you put inside my head.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.630
I'm right guys...
aren't I?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.660
I'm telling you,
he can't be gone...

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.460
there's no use
denying it, yuma.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.460
You're never going to see
your friend astral again.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.090
Astral...

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.130
there was no other choice, yuma.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.530
I must win this for my family.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.530
Now, let's finish our duel.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.090
We'll play out these
last moves with the

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.990
help of my chronomaly
City babylon field!

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.330
It lets me banish my chronomaly
Aztec Mask golem from my

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.290
graveyard, so that I can summon

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.260
Cabrera catapult
in defense mode!

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.190
And now I hand
things over to you!

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.060
Too bad you only have
400 life points left.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.930
And I have Cabrera
catapult and number 33:

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.430
Machu mech on my field!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.960
You have no chance of
making a comeback now.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.430
Especially since you don't have
your friend astral to help you.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.230
I am gonna win this duel.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.290
I'll do it... for astral!

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.890
I promise!

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.960
I'm gonna high five the sky!

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.990
No matter what happens to me,
your future is truly limitless.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.660
pthat's right!

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.630
pastral is still with
pme... in my memory!

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.160
pand He always will be...

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.590
pas long as I remember all
pthe things he taught me.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.790
First, you must understand
your opponent's strategy.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.630
Even your most powerful deck
will be useless if you allow

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.060
your opponent to control
how the duel plays out.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.590
ptrey's plan is to use
pcabrera catapult and

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.390
pmachu mech as a combo.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.590
pif he pulls it off,
pit's game over.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.630
Once you know your opponent's
strategy, shut it down.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.530
pthat means I have
pto destroy Trey's

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.530
pcabrera catapult
por his machu mech!

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.860
What's that?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.030
I see.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.790
Astral must've left it for me!

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.530
The rest is up to you.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.530
Feel the flow yuma.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.660
I will.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.090
I promise, astral!

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.930
I'll fight this duel
like you're still with me!

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.990
We'll win this thing...
and we'll do it together!

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.990
I activate the equip
spell gagagarevenge!

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.730
By doing that,
I'm able to return a

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.330
gagaga monster
from my graveyard!

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.330
C'mon back, gagaga magician!

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.690
But I'm not done yet!

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.030
I summon flelf!

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.560
It's as mighty as a cyclone!

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.290
Once a turn, I
can send a monster

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.790
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.790
and then flelf gets boosted
by that monster's level.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.160
Overlay eater is level 2, so
when I send it to the graveyard,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.630
that pumps up flelf to level 4!

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.260
This... isn't good.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.560
And it's gonna get even worse,
'cause I'm gonna overlay flelf

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.860
with gagaga magician in order to

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.860
xyz summon NUMBER 39: Utopia!

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.860
That again!

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.990
Astral left me this
number to help me stop

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.890
you and to give me hope.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.060
What hope?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.460
You only have
400 life points left.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.660
That doesn't matter.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.360
If I had one point left,

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.190
I'd still keep trying
to win this duel.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.830
I'll never give up Trey,
'cause I am so feelin' the w!

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.090
Now I activate the effect of
my equip spell, gagagarevenge!

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.060
Since I used gagaga magician to
xyz summon, my xyz Monster Gains

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.260
300 attack points, bumping up

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.290
utopia's strength!

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.860
You're all set, utopia!

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.760
Take it to machu mech!

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760
Rising Sun TWIN blade blast!

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.490
Way to go utopia!

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.490
What?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.460
How can you duel like
this... without astral?

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.060
You don't understand, Trey.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.830
Astral will always be a
part of me no matter what!

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.260
Nothing you can do to
me will change that.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.930
It doesn't matter.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.360
Your luck is all used up!

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.330
You're the one out of luck!

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.890
I still have plenty of
surprises up my sleeve.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.030
You'll see!

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.990
Here's how a great
duelist gets it done!

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.760
I tribute my Cabrera catapult

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.830
so I can summon
chronomaly Sol monolith!

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.230
By Summoning my monolith,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.360
I can pick another monster on my
field and change it to level 6!

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.360
And that's what I'm
gonna do to mud golem!

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.260
Then I'll overlay my level six
mud golem with my Sol monolith!

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.960
With These two monsters,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.330
I build the overlay
network and xyz summon!

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.660
It's hopeless, yuma!

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.060
You and your puny monsters are
about to get squashed like ants!

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.060
Reveal Yourself, number 6:
Chronomaly atlandis!

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.690
Whoa... I'm
in big time trouble now.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.760
That's an all new number.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.590
Now atlandis, it is time!

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.930
Atlandis Can equip itself with
a number card from my graveyard

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.930
and gain its attack points!

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.390
You're equipping it
with machu mech?

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.390
That's right!

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.390
5000 attack points?

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.430
How is yuma gonna survive
an attack by that?

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.890
Atlandis, take out utopia!

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.690
Eternal devastation!

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:45.460
Utopia, now, use an overlay
unit to stop that attack!

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.560
Go Light wing shield!

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.190
Yeah!

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.530
Hold it!

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.760
Atlandis has more
power than you realize!

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.130
It's gonna use
Its other ability!

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.360
And you're taking a direct hit!

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.330
By Using one overlay unit,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.390
atlandis wipes out
half your life points!

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.390
Orichalcum gate!

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.330
Yuma!

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.030
I knew you'd never
survive without astral!

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.030
This Duel is over!
