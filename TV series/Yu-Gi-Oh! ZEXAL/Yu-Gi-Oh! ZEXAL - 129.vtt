Yuma, Tori!

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.683
(Yuma) Where are we?

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.686
I lack sufficient data
to answer.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.201
It's Alito!

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.738
So you thought you could run
away from me, did you?

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:21.074
We still have a score
to settle, you little chicken!

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:25.178
I'm not a chicken, but I'm not
gonna fight with you, Alito!

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.279
Not even to get back at me

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.348
for what I did
to your friend Nistro?

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:33.053
I guess that big oaf never knew
what a coward you are, Yuma.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.689
Don't you
talk about my friend Nistro.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.758
So then I guess you
don't want me to tell you

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.294
what a lame and pathetic
duelist he was?

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.764
Alito, why are you acting
this way?

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.065
What happened to you?

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.667
Nothing's happened, Yuma.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.737
Maybe you're only seeing
the real me for the first time!

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.539
Perhaps but unlikely.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.307
You were once like Nistro.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.409
Children looked up to you.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.245
They wanted to be like
you like a hero.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.748
Don't pretend to me know me,
because you don't!

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:02.649
Yes, I do.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.752
He must be referring
to the legend

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.683
(screaming)

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.726
(cheering)

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.228
(Astral)
Alito, you once made
a big difference

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.763
in the lives of many children.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.099
You brought them smiles
and inspired them

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.034
with your great courage.

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:55.535
I do not think they
would approve

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.637
of your current actions.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.439
You were their hero, Alito.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.575
Just as Nistro had been.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.709
The kids.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.212
My life touched their lives.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.614
Do not let them fool you.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.983
Your past life had no
great purpose!

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:13.754
It brought you only
disappointment and sorrow!

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.088
I remember now!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.757
I was tricked and lied to.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.760
Just like you're trying
to do now.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.695
But it won't work!

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.700
You're not going to save
yourself!

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.136
Time to duel, Yuma.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:29.736
No way, Alito!

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.607
I told you before I'm not
dueling with you!

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.608
Coward.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:38.411
Maybe this will change
your mind.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.751
(screaming)

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:48.755
Tori!

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:49.756
Yuma!

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:51.758
Well?

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:55.362
If you want to save her,
you have to duel me.

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:59.666
Alito, isn't there
any goodness left in you?

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.168
We have no choice.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:04.204
Rescuing Tori is our
top priority.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.706
Yuma!

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.575
All right.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.744
(yelling)

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.445
Duel Disk, go!

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.620
Duel Gazer, let's roll!

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.725
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.568
All right, I go first.

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.736
I draw!

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.373
I summon Gagaga Magician!

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.179
Now I summon this little fella!

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.617
I can do that when there's
a Gagaga monster on my field.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:55.121
And when summoned, it becomes
the same level

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.290
as Gagaga Magician.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.695
Gaga!

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.764
And now, I overlay my
Level 4 Gagagas

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:07.500
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.038
I Xyz Summon Number 39:
Utopia!

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:23.750
Now I play
a facedown and end my turn!

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.752
It's your move, Alito

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.721
Same old Utopia!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.055
It hasn't changed

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.324
But I have.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:36.062
I'm very different!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.764
I feel something weird.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.767
Yuma, you can sense it as well?

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:41.201
Yeah.

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:45.438
It's like he's possessed by
some kind of evil spirit.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.740
Quite so.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.074
Prepare yourself, Yuma!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:52.445
I call upon the dark
powers of my Barian ancestry!

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.282
Soon the power coursing
through my hand

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:58.485
will knock you off your feet!

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.254
I draw!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:07.360
And the card
I got will crush you!

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.731
I activate Rank-Up-Magic
The Seventh One!

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.234
Oh, no...
Not that card!

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.535
Oh yes, Astral!

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:18.004
This is the card that puts
the combined power

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.207
of the seven Barian
emperors at my command

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.678
and allows me to call
forth my Number!

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.680
(laughing)

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:33.353
I summon Number 105:
Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus!

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.626
Astral, I've got an incredibly
bad feeling about this!

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.762
Your bad feeling
will soon get much worse!

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:46.766
Rank Up Magic The Seventh One
ranks up Star Cestus

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.569
into a Chaos Xyz Monster!

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.741
Go Chaos Xyz Evolution!

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.248
I summon Chaos Number 105:

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:05.752
Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus!

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.662
We must be on guard.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.198
I sense a great evil.

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.166
(laughing)

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.601
I know who that is.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.270
It is all becoming clear now

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.338
What is it Astral?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.407
As Barian World fuses
with your own,

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.976
new details
are being revealed to me.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:34.748
The Barian Numbers
were created by Don Thousand.

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:38.118
And he is the one controlling
Alito!

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.753
Don Thousand?

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.254
I know you are here!

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.356
Show yourself, Don Thousand!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.758
Huh?

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.064
Whoa, what's happening?

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.400
(Don Thousand laughing)

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.101
Finally.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:58.571
It has been a long
time, Astral.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:02.509
And you must be Yuma Tsukumo.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:04.411
So you're the one
behind all of this?

00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:07.747
That means you're the reason
Alito's acting weird!

00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.748
Very good.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.984
I should
reward your cleverness,

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:13.586
but I am afraid all I have
to offer you

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.555
is misery and defeat!

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.757
Yeah, then bring it on!

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.639
So you're the one
behind all of this?

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:29.076
That means you're the reason
Alito's acting weird!

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:30.077
Very good.

00:09:30.077 --> 00:09:32.079
I should
reward your cleverness,

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:34.882
but I am afraid all I have
to offer you

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:37.084
is misery and defeat!

00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:37.618
Bring it on!

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:40.988
If you want to battle anyone,
it should be Astral!

00:09:40.988 --> 00:09:44.091
It was his world that
caused all this fighting!

00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:46.026
Astral World created
Barian World

00:09:46.026 --> 00:09:51.098
when it exiled countless souls
to rid their world of all chaos!

00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:52.099
But we had reason to!

00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:55.602
We hoped without chaos our world
would be pure order!

00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:58.705
You and the people
of your world are fools!

00:09:58.705 --> 00:10:02.409
Order and chaos, like day
and night, are inseparable!

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:05.512
And attempting to split the two
has set in motion

00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:07.781
the destruction
of Astral World!

00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:10.083
Your people seem quite
fond of working

00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:12.085
to hasten their own demise!

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.087
Especially you, Astral!

00:10:14.087 --> 00:10:15.088
What?

00:10:15.088 --> 00:10:15.923
Yes!

00:10:15.923 --> 00:10:17.958
You and your friend Yuma
released

00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.027
the seven Mytherian Numbers.

00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:24.965
By doing so you broke their
seal over my powers.

00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:26.567
I should thank you.

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:32.105
Your actions let me grow
infinitely more powerful!

00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:33.640
We helped you?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.908
No, you're lying!

00:10:34.908 --> 00:10:37.478
Why would we
ever do anything for you?

00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:41.748
Because you are
both shortsighted fools!

00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:46.086
Fools soon to fall prey
to my vast powers,

00:10:46.086 --> 00:10:49.490
just as my servant Alito has.

00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:55.028
I activate Comet Cestus'
special ability!

00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:58.465
Once per turn, I can
use one Chaos Overlay Unit

00:10:58.465 --> 00:10:59.666
to destroy a monster

00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:03.036
and inflict damage equal
to its attack points!

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:05.606
Good riddance, Utopia!

00:11:07.908 --> 00:11:10.077
Utopia has 2,500 attack points,

00:11:10.077 --> 00:11:14.815
so your life points are gonna
take a pummeling!

00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:20.354
No, Yuma... Astral!

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:21.655
I'm not through.

00:11:21.655 --> 00:11:24.658
Comet Cestus can still attack!

00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:28.829
And it'll knockout
the rest of your life points!

00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:31.698
Celestial Burst!

00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:36.103
Alito, this battle's not over
by a long shot!

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:40.040
I summon Gagaga Gardna!

00:11:43.677 --> 00:11:44.945
When we are attacked directly,

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:48.582
we can summon Gagaga Gardna
to defend ourselves.

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:51.818
Yes, but your defense will
soon meet its demise!

00:11:51.818 --> 00:11:54.021
And your end is not far behind.

00:11:54.021 --> 00:11:55.956
You see when I destroy
your monster,

00:11:55.956 --> 00:11:59.092
you take damage
equal to its attack points!

00:11:59.092 --> 00:12:01.094
Goodbye, Yuma!

00:12:01.428 --> 00:12:01.762
Hold up!

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:05.065
I activate Gagaga Gardna's
special ability!

00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:08.068
By sending one card in
my hand to the graveyard,

00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:11.505
Gagaga Gardna isn't destroyed!

00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:16.677
(screaming)

00:12:17.077 --> 00:12:18.845
No!

00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:25.085
Oh, no!

00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:28.922
Yuma only has 200 life points!

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.760
That was a lucky break

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.096
Your last one!

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.098
Yuma
Hey, are you okay, Astral?

00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:43.437
Yes, though I did not anticipate
the ferocity of his attack.

00:12:43.437 --> 00:12:44.504
I know.

00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:45.105
When you duel with Alito,

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:48.508
you gotta be ready for just
about anything.

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:51.078
Yuma, are you enjoying this?

00:12:51.078 --> 00:12:54.481
Well, no, I wouldn't put
it that way.

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:55.082
Thing is...

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:56.383
I sorta had a thought.

00:12:56.383 --> 00:12:58.619
See, Don Thousand's
controlling Alito now,

00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:00.454
but something's telling me
that beating Alito

00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:02.823
will break
Don Thousand's hold over him.

00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:05.092
That is a very interesting
theory.

00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:07.894
Now what
makes you say that, Yuma?

00:13:07.894 --> 00:13:09.096
Call it a hunch.

00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:12.432
It's a chance, but it's one
we've gotta take.

00:13:12.432 --> 00:13:14.668
Observation #23.

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:17.104
The human "hunch" is peculiar.

00:13:17.104 --> 00:13:19.106
Though it holds no basis
in fact,

00:13:19.106 --> 00:13:20.941
human belief
in it can drive them

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:23.443
to turn their "hunch"
into reality.

00:13:23.443 --> 00:13:26.680
I hope this
is one of those times.

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:35.656
I've got to win this duel...

00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:37.858
for everyone that
fought so hard

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:40.460
and put every ounce
of themselves on the line

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.095
to get me to this point.

00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:45.098
All of them, like Nistro.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.402
Nistro.

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:49.102
Nistro?

00:13:49.336 --> 00:13:49.670
That's it!

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.073
I think I've figured out a way
to get through to Alito!

00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:55.942
When Dextra and I
dueled Nistro at Spartan City,

00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:57.077
Dextra fought her heart out

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.683
and that did the trick to make
Nistro come to his senses.

00:14:02.683 --> 00:14:04.918
And that's just
what we've got to do.

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:07.087
We've gotta dig into the bottom
of our hearts

00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:09.089
and give it our all!

00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:12.759
All right Alito...

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:14.428
I draw!

00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:17.097
I'm summoning Tasuke Knight!

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:24.104
I overlay Level 4 Gagaga Gardna

00:14:24.104 --> 00:14:25.839
and Tasuke Knight!

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.476
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:14:29.476 --> 00:14:34.514
I Xyz Summon Heroic Champion
Excalibur!

00:14:34.514 --> 00:14:38.085
This means
it's lights out for you!

00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:49.029
Alito, we've battled each other
before as friends.

00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:53.033
You may not remember it
yet, but we're still friends!

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:55.102
You're my enemy.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.670
Get set to get decked!

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.373
Excalibur, attack Comet Cestus!

00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:03.510
I'm activating
Excalibur's special ability!

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.612
By using all its Overlay Units,

00:15:05.612 --> 00:15:08.381
its attack
points double in battle!

00:15:10.417 --> 00:15:12.085
4,000 attack points!

00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:14.988
Double Shock Sword Slash!

00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:21.495
Well, Alito?

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.798
Did that knock
some sense back into ya?

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:26.099
(laughing)

00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:28.101
Sorry to burst your bubble

00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.604
But by summoning
Battlin' Boxer Veil,

00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:32.806
I take no damage from
your attack!

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:37.043
And don't forget, only
a Number can destroy a Number.

00:15:37.043 --> 00:15:39.079
So my Battlin' Boxer
Comet Cestus

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:41.915
will be sticking around
for another round, Yuma!

00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:43.917
What it all means is that
your big attack

00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:45.952
was totally pointless.

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:48.388
It's gonna take a lot more
than I thought

00:15:48.388 --> 00:15:51.525
to get through to Alito.

00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:52.592
Okay, Alito

00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:54.094
I'll get ya next time!

00:15:54.094 --> 00:15:55.095
Too bad, Yuma.

00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:57.764
There won't be a next time.

00:15:57.764 --> 00:16:00.100
Astral I really hope
he's wrong about that

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.969
Yes, I believe he is.

00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:04.938
When Excalibur
used its Overlay Units,

00:16:04.938 --> 00:16:07.941
Tasuke Knight was sent
to the graveyard.

00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:09.643
When we have
no cards in our hand,

00:16:09.643 --> 00:16:14.080
its special ability allows us to
summon it and end a battle.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.652
As long as we have
Tasuke Knight, we can survive.

00:16:20.086 --> 00:16:22.088
Let's finish this.

00:16:22.088 --> 00:16:25.458
I summon Battlin' Boxer
Headgeared!

00:16:31.331 --> 00:16:34.334
(Don Thousand laughing)

00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:36.803
Don Thousand!

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:41.107
I overlay Level 4 Battlin' Boxer
Veil and Headgeared!

00:16:41.107 --> 00:16:44.477
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:16:44.477 --> 00:16:49.416
and Xyz Summon Number 80:
Rhapsody in Berserk!

00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:06.099
Very unusual.

00:17:06.333 --> 00:17:08.602
That Number doesn't have
any attack points!

00:17:08.602 --> 00:17:11.838
Why would Alito wanna
use a Number like that?

00:17:11.838 --> 00:17:12.372
Oh no!

00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:15.609
Rhapsody in Berserk has
a special ability

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.344
that'll win me this match!

00:17:17.344 --> 00:17:21.748
By using one Overlay Unit,
I can choose either spell,

00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:22.916
trap or monster cards,

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.452
and all cards of that
that type are banished

00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:28.088
from your graveyard.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:30.023
I think I'll pick...

00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:32.025
monster cards!

00:17:35.862 --> 00:17:39.599
So you'll never get a chance
to protect yourself

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.601
with Tasuke Knight!

00:17:44.604 --> 00:17:46.106
He guessed our plan.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.075
Not only can you no longer
protect yourself,

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:50.543
things are gonna get even worse

00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:52.712
when I activate Rhapsody
in Berserk's

00:17:52.712 --> 00:17:54.781
additional special ability!

00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:57.984
I equip it on to Battlin' Boxer
Comet Cestus

00:17:57.984 --> 00:18:01.087
and give it 1,200
more attack points!

00:18:06.092 --> 00:18:07.594
His Number!

00:18:07.594 --> 00:18:08.628
Yuma be careful.

00:18:08.628 --> 00:18:11.031
I sense Don Thousand's power!

00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:12.499
You mean...

00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:17.404
you mean Don Thousand's
powering up Comet Cestus?

00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:17.971
Correct!

00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:19.706
And in moments you
will both snap

00:18:19.706 --> 00:18:23.543
under the full weight
of my colossal might!

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:27.948
Comet Cestus, attack Excalibur!

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:31.718
Yuma!

00:18:31.718 --> 00:18:34.054
You're through!

00:18:34.054 --> 00:18:35.422
Oh, no, you don't!

00:18:35.422 --> 00:18:38.825
I activate the trap XYZ Pieces!

00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:40.560
When my Xyz Monster's attacked,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.963
this card totally blocks it!

00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:50.103
My Comet Cestus' attack!

00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:53.106
Now by tributing my Heroic
Champion Excalibur,

00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:55.108
I can summon two
Level 1 monsters

00:18:55.108 --> 00:18:56.576
from my deck to the field

00:18:56.576 --> 00:19:00.847
and all I have to do is negate
their special abilities.

00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:04.050
Come on out,
Darklon and Kurivolt!

00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:13.093
You don't know
when to give up, Yuma.

00:19:13.326 --> 00:19:16.096
But you soon will I promise!

00:19:16.096 --> 00:19:19.899
We cannot break Don Thousand's
control over Alito.

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:21.534
I'm not so sure.

00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:23.103
We can't give up, Astral.

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:25.672
We've just gotta prove that
the power of our friendship

00:19:25.672 --> 00:19:27.974
is stronger
than Don Thousand's power.

00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:32.879
Yuma, how are you planning to
accomplish that endeavor?

00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:33.413
Simple.

00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:35.081
I'm gonna play a blast
from the past!

00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:37.083
Our Lionheart!

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:39.386
Lionheart?

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.087
We should not use that Number.

00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:43.923
It would be extremely
dangerous for us.

00:19:43.923 --> 00:19:45.091
I know it is, Astral

00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:47.093
But it used to be Alito's card,

00:19:47.327 --> 00:19:50.764
so maybe using
it will jog his memories.

00:19:50.764 --> 00:19:51.798
Of course.

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:53.533
Lionheart used
to be Alito's Number

00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:56.102
before Don Thousand gave him
Comet Cestus.

00:19:56.102 --> 00:19:59.439
