you made with the other sections

tossed it in the recycling?

Please no!

I don't want to deal

[ARATA]
Who's Aida?

46
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,333
[THEO]
Aida Koharu.

47
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,500
She works here
in General Affairs.

48
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,791
It says here her kid
is having chronic nightmares.

49
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,208
Isn't that more of a job
for a therapist?

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,000
Senda thinks
we should handle it,

51
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,208
which means using a therapist
would be the wrong call.

52
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,833
So, should this be our priority?

53
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
Absolutely not!

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,958
Budget sheets are our priority!

55
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,458
Back me up? Please.

56
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,125
Uh...

57
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,666
Arata, can you handle this
on your own?

58
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,916
Huh? Should I?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,583
That's up to you.

60
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,916
You can always call us
if you need help.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,250
Tell you what,
I'll let Aida know

62
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,458
you'll be out there
to talk with her soon.

63
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,875
Roger that. Thank you.

64
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,125
I got this.

65
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,375
Trust me.

66
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,375
[THEO]
Am I going crazy,

67
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,416
or have we dealt
with something like this before?

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,916
We have.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,208
Though it was actually
much worse

70
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,541
when we were
at Ota Wards in Nerima.

71
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,666
Oh, now it makes sense.

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,166
It's a lot easier to handle
if you've survived it before.

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,625
Very true. Also, he's been
at it long enough

74
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
that he should have
more confidence in his work.

75
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,458
So, if that's honestly
how you feel about the guy,

76
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,333
then why were you
so hard on him

77
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,458
during that whole
Azazel situation?

78
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,208
I've already said
I feel bad about that.

79
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,375
Oh?

80
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,750
I definitely
underestimated him.

81
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,458
Though I didn't expect him
to refuse my apology.

82
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,500
So it still feels like
I'm in debt or something.

83
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,208
-Well, if that's the case...
-Ow!

84
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,166
...free yourself
of these chains.

85
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,833
Be a good leader to him.

86
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,333
Copy that.

87
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,541
So, how much do you know?

88
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,166
Just that
it's about dreams

89
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,875
and that there's a reason
you were sent to our department.

90
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,083
Yeah.

91
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,333
It's happening to one
of my two little boys.

92
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,500
The younger one.

93
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,750
His first name is Ryo.

94
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,708
His school called and said
he's been falling asleep

95
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,708
in class a lot lately.

96
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,875
What did I tell you
about staying up so late?

97
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,625
Not to, but when I sleep,
I have nightmares.

98
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,208
Yeah? Let me guess.

99
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,916
Was it about a haunted house
like the kind

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,583
you went to
with your father?

101
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,166
I don't know where it is,

102
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,375
but there's a monster
that's chasing me.

103
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
And everyone knows that
if it finds you

104
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,708
three times, it eats you!

105
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,333
I know it's real because
it already ate my friends

106
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,708
Acchan and Yo!

107
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,625
I know you miss your friends,

108
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,125
but they'll get better soon
and be back

109
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,375
at school before you know it.

110
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,375
It'll eat me next!

111
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,875
I don't want to die!

112
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,666
And the monster already
found me twice.

113
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,666
The thing is,
both of his friends

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
that he mentioned
had the same dream

115
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,916
before they stopped
coming to school.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,291
I see.

117
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,666
[AIDA]
I tried to explain to him

118
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,958
that getting hurt in dreams

119
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,333
doesn't actually hurt you
in real life.

120
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,875
But then several days ago,
Ryo wouldn't wake up.

121
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,416
He's still lying in a coma
as we speak.

122
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,208
The doctors can't find anything
physically wrong with him.

123
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,000
[ARATA] That must be
extremely hard on you.

124

Explains why you haven't been
to work in a while.

125
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah.

126
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,041
When I told Reiji that none
of the medical experts knew

127
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,416
what was going on,
he said...

128
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,416
Sounds like
it's a case for us.

129
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,625
What?

130
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,000
It's unusual for doctors

131
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,208
and detectives
to be this stumped.

132
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,458
Which means it may be
beyond their comprehension.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,333
I'll talk to my staff
about it as soon as I get in.

134
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,041
Someone'll be in touch soon.

135
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,208
I was so mad at myself.

All right.

So let's start by gathering

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,708
That's great,
but what makes you so sure

491
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,291
he's not going to do it again
to others in the future?

492
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,833
I don't know.

493
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
But...

494
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,625
that wasn't right.

495
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,750
You basically killed someone
who'd reformed.

496
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,500
As if that could erase
their original crime.

497
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,541
Pointless.

498
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
[SATORU]
Anothers are not people.

499
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,708
Trust me.

500
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,875
They're more like
unfinished ideas,

501
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,083
and they always repeat
the same actions.

502
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,625
The only way to stop them
is to eliminate them.

503
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,791
[ARATA]
Eliminate them?

504
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,208
You've also made it
abundantly clear

505
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,041
that I can't trust
your judgment.

506
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,541
[ARATA] Oh, so now the Ears
of Sand are a giant lie?

507
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,833
[SATORU]
No.

508
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
I've heard a lot of stories.

509
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,041
For instance, the one
about the evil Another

510
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,166
that calls itself your friend
so it can manipulate you.

511
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,375
And so, how do we know
you're not trying to trick us?

512
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,625
You might even be helping your
friend bring chaos to society.

513
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,375
After all, you are
a known servant

514
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,083
of the god of chaos
and deception, aren't you?

515
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,666
You might even claim
you didn't realize

516
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,625
he was the destroyer
of civilization.

517
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,791
What the hell?

518
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,166
Are you saying
you can't trust me?

519
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,125
[laughing]

520
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,625
[SATORU]
Come on.

521
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,666
Do you think I'm the only one
who feels that way?

522
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,708
You're defending
the integrity of Anothers?

523
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,125
Then you're surrounded by people
who aren't honest with you.

524
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,416
What exactly are you getting at?

525
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,916
I'll tell you.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,541
I don't need you
or the Ears of Sand,

527
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,833
Arata Miyako.

528
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:44,958
