That's exactly right.

159
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,166
He swore his eternal love
to her, but she passed away,

160
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,666
and now he's trying
to bring her back from the dead.

161
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,833
It's been years now.

162
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,333
[sighs softly]

163
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,791
Who's that? And where am I?

164
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,625
-[SHIORI] Shh!
-Huh?

165
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,375
Be quiet.

166
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,000
[gasps softly]

167
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,958
[IZUMI]
I can't move my left hand.

168
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,375
[energy shimmering]

169
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,625
Finally done.
All her limbs are ready to go.

170
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,250
-And now...
-[BOTH gasp]

171
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,333
[AZAZEL] Don't worry.
It won't fail this time.

172
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,750
Don't worry. It's okay.
Don't worry.

173
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,208
[gasping softly]

174
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,333
[THEO] So the one girl's leg
and the other's voice were...

175
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,125
[ARATA]
Yeah. Apparently, they're like

176
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,083
the parts needed
to bring her back to life.

177
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,666
But it's not
as simple as that,

178
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,333
because a lot of the parts
keep getting rejected.

179
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,000
That's why he kept looking.

180
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,750
That makes sense.
If he could have used anyone,

181
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,125
he would have stopped
after kidnapping

182
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,125
just a handful
of these girls.

183
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,250
Yeah, and what's more,

184
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,291
he didn't care about the ones
that didn't work

185
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,791
or were used already
and gave them to Kohaku.

186
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Which explains
what those girls

187
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,750
were doing in Toyama Park
that night.

188
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,166
Huh?

189
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,458
Flowers?

190
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,250
Huh? Really?

191
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,625
Flowers in a weird place
like this?

192
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,125
Let me see. Is that wolfsbane?

193
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,166
[grunts]
Hold on just a minute!

194
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,958
Is this "guard dog" Cerberus?
Give me a break!

195
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,333
[KYOICHI]
What's wrong, Theo?

196
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,875
[THEO] Wolfsbane blooms
from Cerberus's drool!

197
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
This isn't exactly
its natural environment,

198
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,750
so if there's this much of it,

199
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,041
that means Cerberus
has to have been here recently!

200

-[liquid sloshing]
-[soft growling]

201

[KOHAKU]
What now?

202
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,000
Will you leave
before you're found?

203
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,291
Or keep pushing onward?

204
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,416
[CERBERUS]
This smell.

205
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
It's been so long
since I've had meat.

206
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,833
Where is it?
Meat. Meat!

207
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,041
Where is the meat?
Not just that.

208
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,958
There's the smell of Coyote
and sweet candy, too.

209
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
Is that thing Cerberus?

210
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,041
[roaring]

211
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,625
Yes. That's right.
Have fun running!

212
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,291
Have fun what?

213
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,666
[CERBERUS]
Is that you I smell, Coyote?

214
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, crap.

215
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,250
Found it!

216
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,500
Good thing I had this.
It loves sweets!

217
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,125
We can use it to distract it!

218
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,291
Book it!

219
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,583
[panting]

220
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,208
That was actually
a nice little distraction.

221
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,583
-However...
-[growling]

222
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,000
[KOHAKU] You're gonna
need more than that!

223
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,083
We won't last a second
if that thing catches up to us!

224
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,416
[KYOICHI]
We know!

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,208
-Great!
-[growling]

226
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,375
[AZAZEL]
Now it's all here.

227
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,458
The arms, the legs, the hair,
the body, everything.

228
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:01,000
I finally have the parts I need.
She'll be just as she once was.

-My lovely.

[AZAZEL]
All that's left are the eyes.

233
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,958
These are hers.

234
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,333
So I'll be taking them back.

Shut up!

You can't have this one.

-That was close.
-You're so difficult!

I told you it would kill you
if you let it.

Next time, you had
better listen to me.

I can't always step in.

I honestly never thought the day
would come when I'd thank you.

But, thanks.

It's not like I care
about your little friends.

I just can't have
you dying on me.
