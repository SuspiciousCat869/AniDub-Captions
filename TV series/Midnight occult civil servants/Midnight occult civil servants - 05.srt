1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,916
[YOKOYAMA]
So, your newbie hasn't quit yet?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,333
That's pretty impressive.

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,125
[SENDA] Nope.
He's hangin' in there.

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,916
-[YOKOYAMA] That so?
-[SENDA] Yeah.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Look, think whatever you want
about me,

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,375
but I'm a good judge
of character.

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,708
[YOKOYAMA]
Sure you are.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,875
That's why everyone younger

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,625
than Kyoichi's quit on you.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,958
[SENDA]
Wait, I think I found it.

11
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,416
Yeah, right here.

12
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,500
What does that look like to you?

13
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,750
Honestly, I have no idea.

14
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,125
Is that our jurisdiction?

15
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,958
I think you should look into it.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
The thing is, I'd love to.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,250
But no. Every time I request
to investigate that scene,

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm rejected for some reason.

19
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,791
And you think
you'll get approval

20
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,291
by getting us involved?

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,208
[chuckles, slurps]

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,041
Yeah, that sounds about right.

23
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,958
Great.

24
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,083
[THEO]
You're talking about the north

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,916
and south elevators
in City Hall?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,291
That's right. We've officially
gotten clearance to investigate.

27
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,916
Well, It's about damn time.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,041
-So, this is good?
-Huh? [sighs]

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,291
Really?

30
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,375
Did you just ask
that question out loud?

31
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,541
This is
The Parallel World Elevator!

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
Please tell me
you've at least heard of it.

33
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,041
I can't.

34
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,583
-Sorry.
-[sighs]

35
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,166
Wow, that's unfortunate.

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,875
You should consider it
a part of your job

37
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,541
to research what's happening
in the world of the occult.

38
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,958
Here, just do a search.
It'll pop up right away.

39
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,875
Okay, thanks.

40
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,875
[THEO] Someone posted about it
on our business page.

41
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,458
Basically, someone took the lift
to the Observation deck,

42
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,500
and when the door opened
they were in a different world.

43
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,791
We have a page?

44
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,333
-Yeah, and I designed it.
-Huh?

45
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,083
[THEO] This guy was posting
every time

46
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,625
something would happen
with this elevator

47
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,875
as it was happening.

48
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,500
And then one day
he just stopped

49
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,708
and couldn't be traced.

50
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,916
Rumors say it's because

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
he's mysteriously
gone missing.

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
Ever since his disappearance,

53
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,125
a few others have posted
about similar incidents

54
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
happening to them
on these same elevators.

55
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,125
Some of these
were obviously trolls

56
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,625
fabricating
to get attention,

57
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,625
but there are other accounts
where it's not as clear.

58
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,083
[SENDA] And there are more and
more alleged reports every day.

59
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,625
The police are finally taking
the case seriously

60
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,083
and actively looking
for the missing people.

61
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,250
Really?

62
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,500
So, then, why don't
we just let them

63
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,958
handle the investigation?

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,541
Because there could be more
to these disappearances

65
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,833
than the police
are equipped to deal with.

66
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:00,916
Watch.

67
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,125
-[THEO gasps]
-[ARATA] What the...

68
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,083
[SENDA] At first,
I thought it was because

69
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,000
she was in
the Parallel World Elevator

70
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,166
and this was the point
when she teleported.

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,541
[THEO gasps]

72
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,041
But she came back.
Same place.

73
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,291
[SENDA] With no visible injuries
or signs of struggle.

74
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,666
And for some reason,
she has no memory of any time

75
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,333
spent in the observatory.

76
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,083
We have similar reports from
several other visitors as well.

77
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,625
[THEO] Looks like
there are a group of people

78
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,916
who have gone missing

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,291
and a separate group
with lost memories.

80
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,875
[ARATA] Could that mean
there are two separate

81
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,500
Anothers at City Hall?

82
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,166
[THEO]
It's possible.

83
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,916
But I hope that's not the case.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,083
Right. Kyoichi's on his way now

85
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,000
to meet the girl
we just watched.

86
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,291
Apparently, she's someone
he kinda knows.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,708
[GIRL] I remember getting out
of the elevator

88
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,791
and walking
to the south observation deck,

89
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,208
and then
it was like I blinked

90
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,083
and was suddenly
on the north deck!

91
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,833
I mean,
talk about freaky, right?

92
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,958
Was there anything else
unusual about it?

93
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,583
Seriously?

94
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,041
Is teleporting from
one observation deck to another

95
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,916
and having no memory
of it not enough?

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,708
Have you been around
anyone else recently

97
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,458
who's experienced
something similar?

98
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,958
Um, something similar?

99
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,250
Well, my friend told me that
she got into the north elevator

100
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
and ended up
in some bizarre cloud land

101
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,125
with a woman holding a box.

102
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
You know, like all those stories
that came out?

103
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,375
Right. So your friend actually
remembered the full incident,

104
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,666
but you don't remember anything

105
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,041
between standing
on the two different decks?

106
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,333
Are you sure?

107
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,833
[GIRL]
Hmm? Yeah, I've got nothing.

108
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,250
Wait. Aoi.

109
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,166
Hmm? Yeah, what is it?

110
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,083
Why are you acting all serious?

111
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,416
[KYOICHI]
What happened?

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,875
Did you make up with him?

113
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,375
-[AOI] Hmm?
-Your maybe-ex-boyfriend.

114
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,958
Uh, no, Mr. Nosey-Pants.

115
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,458
But if we're done talking
about freaky elevators,

116
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,125
there's a girl at my work
that you have to meet.

117
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,625
Seriously.

118
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,208
I'll have a thing at my place
and invite you both!

119
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,250
[THEO]
So what did Aoi say?

120
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,625
Anything major?

121
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,041
[ARATA]
Who's Aoi?

122
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,791
[KYOICHI] She was a customer
when I was a host.

123
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,083
[ARATA] Oh.
That's cool, I guess.

124
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
[KYOICHI] She didn't say
anything to help clarify

125
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,208
how the disappearances
are happening,

126
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,083
but she did say something

127
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,708
that disturbed me a little.

128
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,416
She was engaged to a guy
she'd been with for a while,

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,916
but just the other day, he broke
up with her out of the blue.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,291
She was devastated.

131
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,666
But when I met up with her,
she didn't seem bothered

132
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,041
by it at all.

133
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,958
You would never guess
she had been suffering.

134
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,166
[THEO] You don't think
she just got over it?

135
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,708
No.

136
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,291
It felt more like she'd
forgotten that it had happened.

137
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,708
So, do you think she lost
her memories of that guy

138
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,666
all together or just that
they had been engaged?

139
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,666
She remembered that
she had a boyfriend,

140
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,541
and she was aware
that they broke up,

141
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,000
but it was like
she completely forgot

142
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,000
how heartbroken she was
and that she was working

143
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,708
through a depression
only days ago.

144
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,291
Like the sadness was deleted.

145
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,250
Anyway, that's
a secondary issue.

146
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
We need to examine
the scene first.

147
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,000
What do you think, Theo?

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,583
[THEO] So far, I'm not finding
any signs of crests or spells

149
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,250
-that could've been used.
-[elevator chimes]

150
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,125
Which means it's highly unlikely
this was artificial.

151
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,500
What do you mean?

152
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,458
Like incorporating magic
to turn this elevator

153
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,250
into some kind of device.

154
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,500
I still don't get it.

155
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,708
Well, then, I'll give you
an example.

156
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,125
If someone's worshiping
an Another

157
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,583
and needs to give it
a sacrifice,

158
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,375
they could turn those doors
into a magical gate

159
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,958
in which to throw
their offerings.

160
