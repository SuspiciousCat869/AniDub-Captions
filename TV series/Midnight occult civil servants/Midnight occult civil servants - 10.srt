about what Kohaku said.

He mentioned something about
an impending festival?

-Yeah.
-What a puzzle.

It's in Izumo.

Kaminashizuki,

It's called the

by the old
Japanese calendar, anyway,

[THEO]
Yeah.

342
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,666
And that's why in September
of the old calendar,

343
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,416
Anothers always start
going missing

the festival in Izumo...

358
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,458
[THEO] Then the Anothers
are using those cocoons
