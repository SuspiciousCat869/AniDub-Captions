it isn't quite that

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
But I thought all grown-ups
had to know what words mean!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
Words can be tricky.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
As people use them, they grow
and evolve just like we do,

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
so the original
meaning can change!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
Did "harassment" do that?

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
It did, and so much more.
It's a special kind of word.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
"Harassment" mutated so much
that it developed superpowers!

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Do you mean
"harassment" can fly?

Now "harassment" is
starting to freak me out.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
We all learn not to
do things to others

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
that we wouldn't want
them doing to us,

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
but when we grow up,

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
we see each other breaking
that rule all the time.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
So much that we gave
breaking it a name.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
That's how grown-ups deal
with confusing things.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
What's the point of
giving names to things

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
when they're confusing?

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] To grown-ups,
an idea without a name

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
is like a big invisible monster.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
And so, they have to
splash it with color,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
and that color is its name.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
But then things change.

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
Because giving it a name
makes it much more powerful,

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
and soon, it's too strong for
even grown-ups to control!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
Grown-ups are dumb, aren't they?

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't need the word
"harassment" if they weren't,

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.772 position:50% align:center
because the concept
would be extinct!

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
You mean like dinosaurs?

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
Just like dinosaurs.

It's bad to hit people,

even if they're acting

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center

The grown-up world can
be confusing like that,
