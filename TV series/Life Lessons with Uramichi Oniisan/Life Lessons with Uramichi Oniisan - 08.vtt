00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] All right,
who's ready to start the show?

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.562 position:50% align:center
<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
I'm Uramichi, and I'm
your gymnast Oniisan!

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
It's time for
<i>Together with Maman</i> ,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
so let's have some fun!

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
Everybody, gather round!

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
Time to come hang out
with your big bro!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
Is he more pumped up than
usual or am I imagining it?

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.831 position:50% align:center
[GIRL B]
It's hard to watch.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] Uramichi Oniisan
has his ups and downs.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
Now it's time for everyone's
favorite part of the show.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
Let's all do the ABC Exercise!

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Ready? Follow me!

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.100 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A] Ooh, I think he
just crashed pretty hard.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
Hey, kids! Wow!

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
This seems like a great
learning moment to me!

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
[GIRL B]
Huh. Guess he's okay now.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
See, once you get to be
as old as your Oniisan,

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
your brain has already scheduled
your moods for the day

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
by the time you wake up.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.617 position:50% align:center
I couldn't say why.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.826 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's to prevent itself

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
from pushing your body
beyond its limits.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.748 position:50% align:center
But sometimes,
fail-safes can fail.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Uh?

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
So right now, I'm on
pace to burn through

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
70% of today's energy
supply before lunch.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.214 position:50% align:center
And as my brain
shakes itself apart,

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
my mood starts to become
erratic, like you saw just now.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C]
Please don't die, Oniisan.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
But it's all
<i>daijoubu</i> , kids!

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.892 position:50% align:center
I can run on fumes till the
end of the day if I have to!

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.394 position:50% align:center
That's what grown-ups do!

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
[BOY A] I don't wanna be
that kind of grown-up.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Okay! Time to gather
round, kids!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
[KIDS cheering, laughing]

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
Easy! No pushing
or shoving, please!

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter,
Kazuki- <i>kun</i> ?

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
You look a bit down.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll feel better
if you come play with us.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Mh-mh.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
You don't feel like it, huh?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
Well, if you don't wanna
play with everybody,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
do you think you
can explain why?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Umm... Mh-mh.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hm?

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
We should just leave
him alone, Oniisan.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
He's been like that
the whole time today.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
He won't talk to anybody.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
Forget him! We all wanna play!

00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
Look, buddy, to be honest,
there's a lot of times

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
when I just don't feel like
doing something, either.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
But no one ever says,
"Leave him alone."

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
And it's not because
they're concerned for me.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
It's because if I'm
not doing my part,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
business grinds to a halt.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
That's why we have to
learn an important skill

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
we call "going along
to get along."

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
It's where you do
what you're told

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
even if you don't want to,

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
so you can say it's
done and clock out.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
Try and learn it in a nice,

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
low-pressure environment
while you can.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
Kazuki- <i>kun</i> , one day,
you're going to miss the times

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
when people saw you
in a bad mood

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
and decided to give
you some space.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
That's truly a privilege.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'll play, too.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
You wanna play, too?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! Good news.
Kazuki- <i>kun</i> wants to play!

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
That's great! Let's all give
him a big welcome, okay?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Okay!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Now, we're still waiting
on a few friends.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Usao- <i>kun</i> and Kumao- <i>kun</i> .
Should we call them?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
I'm seriously asking
if you want to,

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
'cause we don't have to.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
Wait, we don't? Seriously?
But we should, right?

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
You think?

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't you a good kid,

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
thinking about your
friends like that?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Now, let's call out to
Usao- <i>kun</i> and Kumao- <i>kun</i>

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
as loud as we can,
okay, everybody?

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
Ready and...

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Usao- <i>kun</i> ! Kumao- <i>kun</i> !

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] C'mon, Kumatani,
I'm beggin' you, man!

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
I swear, I'll pay you
back next month,

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
no matter what I gotta do!

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Get off me.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Seriously,
I gotta pay my rent!

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, my landlord
is legally obligated

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
to throw me out on the street!

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You're heavy.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
And it's your own damn
fault you're broke!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
Who burned all your money

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
on pachinko and
mahjong, exactly?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
You did.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh, yeah, but--

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
There is no "but"!

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
And either way, you already
owe me 20,000 yen!

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Wait, you remembered about that?

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Buy a tent.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Please, Kumatani.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
We're friends,
aren't we? BFFs, right?

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
That's the last approach

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
you should be trying
to take right now.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I'm sorry, okay?

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Go ask Uramichi for the cash.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Ugh. "Die," you mean.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Man, this has me
missin' our dorm days,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
back before I had
to think about rent.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50% align:center
It was so easier to
get everyone together

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
for drinks back then, too.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
Uramichi's apartment
is just far enough away.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
Making the whole trip is
kind of a pain in the ass.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
It's a real pain in my ass

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
when you make the trip, too.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Huh? Ah!

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
But missing your cue in
two different languages

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
is the biggest pain of all.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Ah! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! We're coming!

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
Also, while we're here,
I could use some help with rent.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
You think this is
the time? Seriously?

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA chuckles]

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Okay, kids!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
I finally found
our furry friends,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
Usao- <i>kun</i> and Kumao- <i>kun</i> !

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
Let's enjoy the time
we have with them

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
because they might not
be back tomorrow!

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
And if they're not, remember,
they're just hibernating,

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
so there's no need
to worry about them!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Please. I can't
afford to lose this job.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
Where do you two live anyway,
Usao- <i>kun</i> and Kumao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
In a grrrreat big forest!

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
But Usao- <i>kun</i> might
get kicked out

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
'cause he's been
a bear-y bad bunny.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
But that's so sad.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna be okay?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
Usao- <i>kun</i> has it pretty rough.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
Um, if the forest kicks you out,

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
I can ask my mommy if we
could adopt you, okay?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
And if she says no,
I'm gonna build

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
a little house for
you in our yard,

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
right next to
Poochie's doghouse!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
[BOY B]
I wanna help, too!

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
[GIRL D] I'll ask Mom
if we can have a bunny!

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
You guys.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I think
Uramichi's having feelings.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
What? Is he sick?

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
I'm just picturing these kids

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
blowing their rent on pachinko.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
And getting ditched
on a group date,

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
and drinking themselves
into oblivion,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
and passing out by the road,

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center

Honestly, there have been
a few things bugging me,

to your back?

a twinge in my lower back,

double-loaded my bar.

done that, right?

[GIRL F] Uramichi Oniisan,
what does "servile" mean?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] It means...
you try to do what people want.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
And at first, that sounds
like a good thing,

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
but then power dynamics
come into play,

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
and there are so
many people to please

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
that your own will
gets shut out.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
Till eventually, you're breaking
your back for someone

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
higher up the food chain
than you can even see

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
in hopes that it's
what they want.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
[GIRL F] So that means
you're servile, doesn't it?

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
Sure does.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
It can be weird listening
to grown-ups talk as a kid.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
When you hear adults
having a conversation,

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
it always sounds too complicated
to ever understand, right?

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
Yeah, true.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
All smoke and mirrors.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
'Cause most of the things

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
they're talking about
are dead simple.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
But the goal isn't
to be understood.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
They wanna distract each
other from the truth,

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
not discuss it.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
So instead of getting
to the point,

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
they hide it under a
pile of grown-up words.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
And the bigger they
make that pile,

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
the less likely anyone will
be willing to dig through it.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
You know when your parents are
scolding you for something

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
and you try to get 'em off your
back by changing the subject?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
It's basically the grown-up
version of that.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
As you get older, you kids
are gonna be picking up

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
lots of difficult new words.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
Words people made up

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
to keep their old excuses
sounding fresh.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
Or at least,
that's what I think.

I wanted to go!

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] And he said
something genuinely kind.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
No venom at all.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
It could have been a line
out of a kids' movie.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
It was so un-Uramichi.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
Not gonna lie,
I was kinda creeped out,

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
but I'm pretty sure he meant it
from the bottom of his heart.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
I don't know if he can
even believe kind words

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
when he hears them,

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
and society and
authority might have

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
ground his soul down to a stump,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
but being a gymnast Oniisan
on a children's show

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
really means something to him,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
so he fights to keep what's
left of his conscience,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
for the kids' sake.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Uramichi, I know
I'm mostly just guessing,

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center

Yeah, that's right.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you
didn't know that.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
Earlier, the mother
approached me.

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
She said she was a fan of mine

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
and she wanted to get
in touch, privately.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
I told her that would be
inappropriate, unprofessional.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
I shot her down.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI, UTANO]
Uh.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] Well, thanks, guys.
It's been an honor.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yeah. Same.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Chin up, bud.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
[GOD] But the GM's daughter
showed no desire to punish him,

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
saying, quote:
"I can work for my snack."

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center

No, I'm good.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
But you wanna know how
old your brain is, don'tcha?

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
Actually, I wanna
get to my gig--

[GIRL G] Daddy, is Uramichi
Oniisan really gonna be here?

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] And, yeah, that's
basically the end of it.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
So, in other words, I am
definitely makin' strides.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Uramichi.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
Whoa! There you are!
<i>Ohayoo gozai</i> -morning...?

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Morning. Balloon, anyone?

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
I'll pass.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
How can a children's
television actor

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
look that weird
holding a balloon?

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
What?

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA gasps]

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
Time to get in
costume, everybody!

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Well, you heard her, Uramichi.
Gotta get in costume.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Ow. Ow. Ow...

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
I'd been meaning to ask you.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
The new <i>Man-Eating</i>
<i>Salmon</i> , seen it yet?

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I checked it out.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
When they tricked him
into swimming upstream

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
into the giant somen waterfall?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
I loved that.

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
Why do you guys
watch that garbo?

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
Those movies suck!

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Why aren't you
changed yet, Usahara?

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Dude, why aren't you?

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, are the
singers not part of this?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] From what I hear,
they'll be recording today.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
[MC A] Welcome to our
Father's Day event!

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
<i>Jump Out! Together with Papan</i>
will be starting right now!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
Gather around,
kids and families!

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Please come and take a seat!

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
For today only, your gymnast
Oniisan and his forest friends

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
are jumping out of the TV studio

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
and bringing the show
straight to you!

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
Now, let's call them
to the stage, okay?

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
Uramichi Oniisan!
Usao- <i>kun</i> ! Kumao- <i>kun</i> !

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] <i>Konnichiwa</i> !
How is everybody feeling today?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad we're
all feeling <i>genki</i> !

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
Or at least our bodies
and our minds

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
aren't actively melting down,

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
which seems to be
where we've set the bar

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
for <i>genki</i> in this
modern society!

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
Now, we're jumping
out of the studio

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
to bring you our ABC Exer--

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
[TAKKUN]
Uramichi Oniisan!

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
Settle down, Takkun.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
Don't interrupt them
during the show, bud!

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
But you always say

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
that I'm supposed to
tell people "thank you"

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
when they do something
nice for me, Dad!

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
My dad always has
a lot of stuff to do,

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
but today he finally
took a day off

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
so he could bring me here
to see <i>Together with Maman</i> !

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
I get to spend the whole day
with my dad because of you!

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Oniisan!

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Uh. I-Is he
crying? For real? Why?

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
And now, it's time to take
a look at the pictures

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
all our friends in the
audience drew of their dads

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
before the show!

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
Wow! Good job, everyone!
These are great!

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
[MC A] So, now it's time for
Uramichi Oniisan and his friends

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
to draw their dads for us,
too, live and in person!

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, uh, I don't think
the script mentioned that.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Since when do we gotta draw?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
I bet all these boys
and girls wanna know

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
what your dads are like,
too, don'tcha, kids?

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
[MC A]
I knew it!

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
She's working this crowd hard.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
Dear old dad!
I hope I draw him okay!

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Question, guys.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what your
dads' faces look like?

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] I mean, I think I
mostly know what he looks like?

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Doesn't mean
I can draw him, though.

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
Why are you acting
like you don't know

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
how to draw your
dad's face, Oniisan?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
As you get older, you tend
to spend less and less time

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
looking closely at
your dad's face,

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
so it gets harder to remember!

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Will I stop liking him?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
No, you'll still like him!

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
But you will feel awkward
just staring at him.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
That's a dad.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Yeah, I'm finished.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Um. You're in character, guys.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
And your dads look
kinda... human-ish.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
[BOY F]
Those look like regular dads.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
[TAKKUN] Wait, you guys are a
bear and a bunny, aren't you?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't your dads
be the same things?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
My dad is a bear, fur sure!

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
If he's not a bunny,

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
then why do his ears
stand so high, hip-hop?

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I started thinking
about how long it's been

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
since I've seen him
and got hyper-focused.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] I have never thought
about my dad that hard.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Oh, uh, hey!

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Let's hop over and have a look
at Uramichi Oniisan's dad!

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
Hippity-hey! That sure
looks like a dad.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
Ah! God!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
Dude. This is horrifying!

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
What are we lookin' at here?

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
My dad was a very strict man.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
When I was little,
he'd fling me onto the mat

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
if I skipped training.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] You're the ragdoll
he's flingin' around?

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] It was more than
my little sister could handle,

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
and she left home at 16.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Uh, oh. So the
other one's your sister. Heh.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
I don't think you'd
ever mentioned her.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it make you feel sad
that you had a dad like that?

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
I don't know what it
would have been like

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
having a different dad,
but if I had,

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
I bet I wouldn't be here
talking to you now.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
We all tend to dwell
on past mistakes

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
and what could've been,

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
but none of us has more
than one life to live,

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
so we can only guess how
things would've turned out.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
We have to look forward
and try to find happiness,

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
because that is our proof
that we made the right choice.

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Your mommies and
daddies have made

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
wrong turns in their lives
just like everyone else,

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
but they can't turn around,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
so you kids have to find the
way forward for yourselves.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
Even if we can't live
for the sake of others,

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
I think it's best if
we can at least live

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
without blaming them
for their missteps.

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:06.011 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Good job, team!

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:10.348 position:50% align:center
Let's go grab a drink, Uramichi!
You, too, Kumatani!

00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:13.101 position:50% align:center
Before we go, let's
play rock-paper-scissors.

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.103 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
What? Why?

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:18.231 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Listen,
I want you to throw after me

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:20.066 position:50% align:center
and lose on purpose.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yeah. 'Kay.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:25.113 position:50% align:center
Here goes. Ready and throw.

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:25.822 position:50% align:center
Throw.

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.365 position:50% align:center
Ready and throw.

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:28.783 position:50% align:center
Throw.

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
--[URAMICHI] Throw. Throw.
--[USAHARA] Throw. Throw.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.037 position:50% align:center
--Throw.
--Throw.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.788 position:50% align:center
--Throw.
--Throw.

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
Heh. I like this version.
Makes me feel like a winner.

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:41.504 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I'll go for drinks
if you take the balloon.

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
Ah. Bro, why would I
wanna take the balloon?

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:46.301 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kumatani,
I'll play you normal

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center
rock-paper-scissors
and the loser has to--

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
No way.

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.597 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Wait, c-come on,
just this one time, please?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.598 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Nope.

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.724 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
This one single time!

00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:54.225 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Not happening.
