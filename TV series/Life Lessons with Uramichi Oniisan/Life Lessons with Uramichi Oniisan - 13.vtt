Looking back on it,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.948 position:50% align:center
it feels like I've been a
gymnast Oniisan forever.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
And at the same time,
it's like I just started.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
Uramichi.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
But no matter how
long it's been,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
my time with you has
been precious to me.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being my
reason to stay swole.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
I discovered my true
calling in this job!

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A]
Uramichi Oniisan!

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
Dude's growin'
some arm-melons!

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
It's the age of Uramichi!

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
You're a runaway train!

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
[STAFF B]
Beefcake!

00:00:58.308 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A] You got a permit
for those guns son?

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.269 position:50% align:center
[STAFF C] His abs are
like monkey bread!

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
Usahara, why aren't you
shouting like the rest of us?

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
Just start shouting, Usahara!

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
What? Why would I?

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
Usahara. Usahara!

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Stop it! I don't understand!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Hey. You still asleep?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
Whoa. I've been dreaming.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
And I think...
it meant something.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.599 position:50% align:center
Why was it about
Uramichi's farewell party?

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
Was this some kind
of divine revelation

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.895 position:50% align:center
that I'm supposed
to organize it?

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.280 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
What?! I had it wrong?

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
So he's quitting his old gym

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.036 position:50% align:center
'cause they're moving locations
to somewhere out of the way?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Yep.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
Jeez, man.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.626 position:50% align:center
Wait, have you known
the whole time?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.003 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.422 position:50% align:center
Then why would you not tell me?

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.715 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You never asked.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
Bro, are you serious?

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.307 position:50% align:center
For real, dude. Why would you
not say anything if you knew?

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.852 position:50% align:center
Why would you assume
instead of asking?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Hey, Uramichi!
That was so not cool.

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
What was?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.195 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you don't know.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
You're allowed to come
out and say stuff

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
instead of being
cryptic all the time.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
Great. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
Wait, come back!

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
Ah, man.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
I know what you're thinkin',

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center
and yes, I get that
it's my own fault.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You're fine.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
[sighs] How many times are they
gonna bring this one back?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
Hey. Who's there?

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
[AMON]
Uramichi.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
[AMON]
Please. I... I'm begging.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
Help me. I need...

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
I need ideas to
put in the show!

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Mister Amon?

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
[AMON] The thing you
thought up last time,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
that Yakumi Shinobi sketch,
has been killing it, hasn't it?

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I still don't
know how that happened.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
I was just rambling.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
[AMON] I want to create
a piece to surpass that!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
But if I hope to eclipse
my own greatest work,

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
my abilities alone
won't be enough!

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to
do it without your help!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Um, you do see me, right?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
Surpassing this
shouldn't be hard.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
There is no going
back to the world

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
as it was pre-Yakumi Shinobi.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
For better or worse,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
that segment set a new
bar for this show.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Where was it before?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
[AMON] So please, I need
your help to make a--

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
Welp, I'm gonna go.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
Don't walk away!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
Does my reputation not
matter to you at all?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
Your reputation... your problem!

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[AMON]
Aw...

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
Uramichi!

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
Stop running away!

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Do you not understand

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
that both our very lives
are at stake, here?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
You can't abandon me, Uramichi!
Please come back!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Hey. Let's dip
before he notices-- Uh.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
I've never seen anybody
run away that fast. Huh?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
Hey! Woodland friends!

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
Did you see Uramichi
come through here?

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Yeah.
I saw him going that-a-way.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Thanks, guys!

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
Uramichi! Please!
I need your help!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
So he's a moron.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's even dumber
than I thought.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
I'm almost impressed.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the heck did you do to
get him all riled up like that?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
I swear, I didn't do
anything. I did nothing!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You're not helping yourself.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
But more importantly, uh,

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
you wanna go grab
some din-din with me?

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
It's been a while and I'm
totally broke this month.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] So what?
You're always broke.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Hey, I hid you
from that guy, didn't I?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
Ahh.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
I still wish I was funny.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Everything okay?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
Well, I feel like somebody's
been watching me.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Have they?

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Probably not.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
Let's go again
sometime, Uramichi!

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
Night, Uramichi.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Night, guys.
Be careful going home.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
For sure!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Dude. Walk straight.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
This is straight.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
So, where to next?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Home.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thank you so much!

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
[AMON]
I'm not proud of this, Uramichi,

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
but for the children's sake,

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
I have to come up with
my greatest work yet.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
No matter what depths
I have to sink

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
in order to make that happen!

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm gonna be
watching you for a while.

So like, with your costumes?

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
Why did they dress
you like that?

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center

he can gladly bid
this world adieu.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
Now, I hope everybody's ready
to sing the Hello Song!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you all to say
"hello" as loud as you can!

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
That's right, boys
and girls, so let's...

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
Let's all just... I'm sorry.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
Bonjour.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] Don't-Don't look
me in the eye like that!

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
What a tire fire.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
[AMON]
We did it.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
This was greater than
I could have hoped for!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
This work will be the imprint
that I leave upon the world!

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
Bravo!

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
[GOD] Indeed, the Hello
Squad would overtake

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
the Yakumi Shinobi
in popularity,

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
and the baguette body pillow
would become a punching bag.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan.</i>

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
This is an emergency!

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I let this happen!

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I should do.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
Do you think we need to
contact the authorities?

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he couldn't have
gotten very far yet, ma'am.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
We should conduct a thorough
search of the building!

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
I would be in your debt!

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
Ahh, dude. I can't believe
it's over already!

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
What's over?

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
Bro, you're not watching
the one show

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
everyone's been talkin' about?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
I guess not.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I'm kinda sad,

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
but I'm also pretty hyped
for the last episode.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
Wonder what they're gonna do.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
It was a slice-of-life
drama, right?

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't expect a curveball
just 'cause it's the finale.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
You clearly know
nothing about TV!

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter what
genre your show is in,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
you gotta go big on
the series finale!

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
Like, for instance,
with our show,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
there could be a big panic
over a missing child.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
We would all search for them,
to the point of exhaustion.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
Until we found them
in a quiet park,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
conveniently during
the magic hour.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
And the show would close with
a tearful parent-child reunion

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
thanks to our heroic efforts!

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
Perfection!

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
And we would call it, "Together
with Maman: Lost Children."

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
That's some grade-A schlock.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Give your
audience a little credit.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Hey, it wasn't that bad.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
We got a problem, team!

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
One of the kids who came in

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
for today's taping
has gone missing!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uh?

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
It's going to be all right.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he hasn't gone far.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
Of course. I just...

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Utano Oneesan!

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Uramichi Oniisan!

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're here.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
There's a little boy
who just went missing.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
I barely took my eyes off him
for a second and he was gone.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
What'll I do?

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
Stay calm. It'll be all right.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
We should split up.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
Where are some places
a kid might run off to?

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
[EDEI, USAHARA]
Uh...

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Hey. Why is everyone
just standing around?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
Is that him?

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Honey, I told you,
you can't wander off like that!

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Sorry, Mommy!

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the show, you guys!

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
Sorry about making it a whole
big thing there at the end!

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, everybody!

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA chuckles]

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Well, good job.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
The lost boy and his
mother were reunited.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Yeah, true enough.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
It was kind of an
anticlimax, though.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
Guess it was too much drama
for a kids' show, am I right?

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, I think we're
missing an Oniisan.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
[EDEI] Oh, Iketeru said that
he was headed to the studio

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
to talk to the stagehands.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
That's all I know.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
[clattering]

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU yells]

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
With the stagehands?
Do we need to be there?

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
No, Director Derekida
said it wasn't necessary.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
Sweet! No argument from me!

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, speaking of the
director, why's he calling me?

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Hello? Do you need something?

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
I guess he changed his mind.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Uh! Guys, this is bad.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
He says Iketeru
has been injured!

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
He's bleeding!

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
This feels like a dramatic
twist, fit for a final episode!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
Quit talking about TV! Come on!

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
Iketeru Oniisan!

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Over there!

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI, UTANO]
Iketeru Oniisan!

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong, guys?

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
You look all flustered.
Everything <i>daijoubu</i> ?

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA chuckles]

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA] Apparently,
he got his hangnail

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
caught on something
and ripped it.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
Use some antiseptic on it

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure it'll
heal up in no time.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Antisep-dick.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
Exactly. Use some antiseptic.

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
No, I know,

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like it has
the word "dick" in it.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
I'm glad it wasn't
a serious injury.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
That would be a sad
way to get canceled.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
Just shut up.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
Man, I was freaked.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
I kinda thought the whole room

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
would be soaked in
blood or something.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
It sounded so sinister
on the phone,

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
but I'm glad
Iketeru's all right.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
"Spinster"?

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
No, no, "sinister." Okay?
I-I just said "sinister."

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
So, uh, does the
shoot start soon?

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
Nope. It's still early.
We'll be stuck here for a while.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
How long?

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
Holy crap. It's happening...

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Am I going to die unmarried,

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
or is five years just
not enough for you?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that your boyfriend?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Mh-hm.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up? Everything cool?
Hang on. Slow down.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait. About us? Really?

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
He's gonna ask.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
He's gonna ask.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
He's gonna ask!

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
Tell me he's not popping
the question over the phone.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
But, hey, there's no better way

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center
for a series to go out
than a wedding.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
Proud of you, Oneesan. So proud!

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
So when you said
it's "about us,"

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
you meant it's about my money

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
and you spending it on a
wedding gift for your buddy?

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
That really took a turn.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
We need to get clear
before she hangs up.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
Come on, we're not safe here.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Sorry, wasn't paying attention.
What's going on?

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]

[DEREKIDA screams]

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] Um. Wait,
shouldn't Utano be here, too?

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I think she needs
some alone time right now.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
Any guy who would pull that with
her is out of his damn mind.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.479 position:50% align:center
Dude, you've got
zero room to talk.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
Wait, what does that mean?

00:14:58.148 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI sighs]

Iketeru!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] Hey! What are
you doing here, Mabui?

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
It's Sayuri.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
[MABUI]
She just...
