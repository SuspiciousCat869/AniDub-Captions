[URAMICHI]
Bar soap's almost gone.

Looks like I'm low
on hand soap, too.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
I need to stop at
the drug store.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
Hopefully I'll remember.

[URAMICHI]
Morning.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
Now, this is where you
bring the kids on

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center

[KUMATANI, USAHARA]
Good morning.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing! Here.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center

Huh? Iketeru!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
Huh?

This is your costume.

[UTANO] I'm glad you've
got so much energy!

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling kind
of icky, though.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
My tummy is hurting
a lot for some reason.

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
I wonder why.

[KUMATANI]
Are you okay, Utano Oneesan?

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
Maybe your tummy hurts
'cause you ate a snack

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
without washing your hands.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I saw Usao- <i>kun</i>
smack his toe on something.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that happened.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] I know! Let's get
somebody to go inside...

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center

He's definitely still hurting.

[YUKA]
Poor bunny.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
Great, but who do we call?

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Okay, kids,
call out as loud as you can!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
One, two...

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Jerminator!

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
I am here!

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
When you need bacteria busted,
you call Jerminator!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
It's Jerminator! Heh. He's here.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Who's that?

[URAMICHI]
You think I'll simply let you

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
put a stop to my plans?

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
Well, think again, Jerminator!

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
This woman's digestive system

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
is going to be conquered
by me, Bacterian!

At last, you show yourself!

But you are the one who's
going to be conquered.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
Soap bubble attack!

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
Take that!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
--[URAMICHI] Ow!
--Oh. Um...

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I think...
your aim was a little too good.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
I'm... so sorry.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] You think that
puny attack could hurt me?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center

It looked like it hurt bad.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center

Real bad.

Can I really throw it at him?

you can. Don't hold back!

Did he mix them up?

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure he did.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Now, come at me
with everything you've got!

constant smoldering rage,

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
he's a pretty decent
guy, isn't he?

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Good work!

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
Begone, Jer--Bacterian!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
Both of them mixed up the names?

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
Twice in one minute.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Ow! Just you wait, Jerminator!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
No, seriously, wait a sec.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
You've won the day,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
but you haven't
seen the last of me!

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
Retreat!

Thanks, everyone!

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
You drove off that
evil bacteria

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
and now my tummy
ache is all gone!

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Always remember
to wash your hands

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
and gargle, kids!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] And they lived
happily ever after.

Great hustle!

You okay, Uramichi Oniisan?

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
I was told you look more like
Bruise-a-michi Oh-no- <i>san</i> .

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Our target audience
probably doesn't care

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
if you throw at less
than full force,

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
but I care if you knock.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Since my theatre days,

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
I've always had to get fully
immersed in a character.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] That's the kind
of character you get into?

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI sighs]

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Wonder if they'll
bring that segment back.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Who knows?

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
Man, I hope it bombs.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] We did sort of just
look like two weirdos

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
playing with balls.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yeah.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] That compress
definitely isn't gonna stick.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yeah...

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
What's that even mean?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Uramichi's apartment is
where toes go to die.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
You visit him, you're gonna
stub your toe on a dumbbell.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
It's a free-range
dumbbell ranch!

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
And what's he even
got to show for it?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
Girls want guys who make 'em
laugh, not meatheads, y'know?

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Hm?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
Man, I wish I was funny!

--Usahara.
--Sir!

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
Are you proud of
"Bruise-a-michi Oh-no- <i>san</i> "?

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
Because it doesn't work,
on any level.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Wait. How did
he know that was mine?

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Anyway, it seems
like there'd be easier ways

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
to remind kids to wash
their hands and gargle.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
Wash your hands. With soap.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Soap?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
And some compresses.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
Welcome!

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan</i> ! Ha-ha!

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Coming!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
Young man, how's your
relationship with God?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
Nonexistent.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
Does your life suffer
from a lack of purpose?

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
Are you caught between
a past full of regrets

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
and a future that promises
nothing but uncertainty?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
That sounds like me.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
God will lift all those burdens
from you if you let Him, dear!

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Oh, will He?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
And all you have to
do is believe in Him

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
and accept Him into your heart!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
I can't even believe
in myself, ma'am.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh. Well, uh...

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Now, if you'll
excuse me, I've got work.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] Uh, if you don't
mind me asking, sir,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
what is your work, exactly?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
My job is to earn
the trust of children

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
and help them learn
about the world.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I get in bed
every night not knowing

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
if I'll have the will to get
out of it the next day.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, a different
bus pulls up to my stop

before the bus to work and
I feel a strong urge to jump on.

I'll go back and try some
food I remember liking,

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
and when I taste it,
it's nothin' like my memory.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
I sometimes forget how to read
and write grade-school kanji.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
I should know me
better than anyone,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
but I can't trust me
to understand myself,

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
and if I can't believe in
myself, who can I believe in?

it's ABC Exercise time!

Hm? Can I help you?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
Is it true that
you're a good drawer

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center

He said that you could draw
KiraPure perfect from memory!

I wanna see you draw
a perfect KiraPure now!

KiraPure?

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I'm pretty sure
it's a Sunday morning anime

never heard of KiraPure

until you said it just now.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
I think KiraPure Pink is the
best out of all the KiraPures!

[URAMICHI] I don't know how
to believe in myself anymore,

And building them back

all gross-looking!

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
I think you're a bit young

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
to be exposed to
things like this.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
But maybe it wasn't his fault,

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
'cause drawing them
right is really hard.

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center

any better, but I'll do my best.

Wait, I didn't say this before,

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center

too hard for her to draw.

Honestly, I feel
like your drawing

Huh? I, uh...

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I was told that
if I had faith in God,

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
He would free me from regret
and anxiety and idiot coworkers.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center

better chance of freeing myself.

do you mean by...? Ah!

a "come in to work early"
type or a "stay late-r"?

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
Um. Would "neither"
be an option?

hypothetical, it's not.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center

[URAMICHI] Sometimes, in the
middle of whatever I'm doing,

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
I think to myself,

00:14:55.562 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
"What am I doing, really?
Is it what I should be doing?"

[sighs]

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Then I notice,
whatever I'm doing,

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
it doesn't feel like it's
making a difference.

[URAMICHI]
Ow!

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Which means I'm forcing myself

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
to suffer, constantly,
for nothing.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
And I start feeling guilty

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
for not doing something
more meaningful.

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
But then I realize that I
don't know what something

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
more meaningful would be.

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
And without meaning,
I don't know how to live.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
So I guess... I have to
try and find meaning...

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
...in whatever I'm doing.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center

I hope you're all ready
for the results.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
Let's see how you did!

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
If your house was a mansion,
or maybe even a few houses,

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
that means you've got big
ambition and high aspirations,

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
and those can take you
a long way in life!

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
And for those of you who just
drew a single, modest home,

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.215 position:50% align:center
remember, you can never
get more out of life

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.508 position:50% align:center
than you put into it.

Moving on!

00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:24.969 position:50% align:center
Did you draw a smiling couple?

00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:28.056 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you've posed them in a
way that shows their affection?

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:29.557 position:50% align:center
If you did, you'll be successful

00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:31.851 position:50% align:center
in romantic and
social encounters!

00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:35.021 position:50% align:center
And you can bet that'll carry
over into your marriage.

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:37.065 position:50% align:center
But you might have drawn
them with dull expressions,

00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:39.734 position:50% align:center
or left lots of distance
between them.

00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:41.903 position:50% align:center
Which could mean you're
keeping too much distance

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.614 position:50% align:center
between you and the
people in your life.

00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:48.076 position:50% align:center
And for a marriage,
that's poison. Sorry!

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:50.245 position:50% align:center
You might wanna get
used to being alone,

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:51.621 position:50% align:center
for everyone's sake.

00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:54.416 position:50% align:center
Last, we'll talk about
the pet you drew, and no,

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
it doesn't matter if you're
a cat person or a dog person.

00:22:57.669 --> 00:23:00.880 position:50% align:center
What does matter is that people
can recognize what you drew,

00:23:00.964 --> 00:23:04.092 position:50% align:center
which indicates a low
level of neuroticism!
