Okay!

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
Great hustle, everyone!
That's a wrap on today's shoot!

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
Thanks for makin' it happen!

[ALL chattering]

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yet another exhausting day.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
Yo, Uramichi!
You wanna go to the--?

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.823 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
Let me finish my
sentence, at least.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
What up, Kumatani?

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
I heard we're havin' a Christmas
party at Uramichi's again.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
Who exactly did you
hear that from?

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
It's either that or
another Christmas alone.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:44.961 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
Ow.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
Uh, I mean, you don't have
plans, right? Nothing goin' on?

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
Right, Kumatani?
Kumatani? Right, my Bro?

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
C'mon, man! You'll be
alone, right, Kumatani?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
Won't you? Answer me!

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
[YUUTA]
Uramichi Oniisan!

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Oh, hey.
You were at the taping today.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuuta! I'm three years old!

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hi, Yuuta- <i>kun</i> !

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
Do you need help?
Where's your mommy?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
The toilet!

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
I don't need help.
I'm waiting! All by myself!

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
And you're doing a
great job, Yuuta- <i>kun</i> !

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
And, hey! Hey, listen!

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
I wrote Santa what I wanna
get for Christmas!

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Oh, did you?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
I hope he brings you
everything you asked for.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
Does Santa bring you
presents on Christmas?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Well, I'm a grown-up,
so he doesn't come to my house.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
So he did when you were little?

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
What kinda stuff did you
used to ask Santa for?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
I mostly asked for toys
like any other kid would,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
but for some reason,
Santa would always show up

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
with an air mattress or a set of
dumbbells or something instead.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
[YUUTA] Does that mean
Santa made a mistake?

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
I suppose so. I must've
gotten a sloppy Santa.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuuta! Look at you,
waiting like a good boy!

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mommy's back!

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yuuta- <i>kun</i> .

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
It's important to have
things you want

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
and things you want to do.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
Remember, your wants matter.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Bye-bye, Uramichi Oniisan!

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Uramichi Oniisan!

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
Uramichi Oniisan.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hi.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
A second ago... I overheard you
talking about your sloppy Santa.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
My Santa messed up
like that all the time.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
You think they were
the same guy?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hm?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
Each year, I would ask
Santa for toys or games,

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
but he would never
bring what I asked for.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
He'd bring me sheet music
and pitch training CDs.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.099 position:50% align:center
I never met anyone
with a sloppy Santa.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
I thought it was just me.
Did we have the same one?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
I remember being
disappointed at the time,

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
but he's probably the reason
I got into music school,

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
and my theatre troupe, too.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
Without him, I wouldn't be able

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
to work on this show
with everyone,

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
so maybe our sloppy Santa
didn't get it wrong after all!

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Iketeru... Seriously,
you don't still believe in--?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Shh!

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
Hey, Uramichi!

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
Someone mentioned that Kikaku
over in Merchandising

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
was trying to find you.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um, sure.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU gasps]

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
Uramichi Oniisan is here!
So nice to finally meet you!

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
Feel free to have a seat.
Sorry about all the clutter.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
Get outta my damn way!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
Heh. Now, let's get straight
to the point, shall we?

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
We're about to get
into the company's

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
best merch-moving
season of the year

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
and a decision was made
to bring out a new line

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
of branded goods
to put in stores

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
for Christmas and the New Year.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
And it seems that decision
came straight from the top.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
Not sure why they waited
till the last minute

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
to mention it to us, though!

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway,
Boss left for the day

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
without finishing this
Kotori- <i>san</i> merchandise pitch.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
And it turns out, the design
is due tomorrow morning!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
And I'm still here,
which means it's my job!

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
But wait, there's more!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
The pitch is for a
full-body plushie,

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
but we don't know what our
birdman's legs look like,

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
'cause the designer
didn't draw any.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
So naturally,
we needed to find them.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't want to
mess up this design!

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
Then I found out the
preorders are already open,

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
and I thought I might take
a cue from Kotori- <i>san</i>

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
and fly out the window!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
'Cause he's some kinda
bird or whatever!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU chuckles]

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU] But in any case,
I started looking into it,

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
and lucky me, turns out
the original designer

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
was working right here
in the building!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
So there's some background.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
Can you help me
with this, Oniisan?

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Dude, I'm dying.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
Thank you so much, buddy!

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
Now get right on that, okay?
Draw those birdie legs.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
So, then, what's
the tape's about?

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU] I gotta make sure
you see this through!

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
I won't leave.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
They all leave.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center
My boss left me here.
My main girl walked out.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
My whole band bailed on me.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
You don't realize how quick
people are to run away

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
at the first sign
of inconvenience.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
I'm just here to
watch your process.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
Act like I'm not even
in the room, okay?

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
This guy is kind of terrifying,

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
but somehow, it feels like we
could understand each other.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hey.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
Christmas is coming up, right?

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
Yeah.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
You got plans?

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
Or you just gonna chill
at home by yourself?

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
Hm?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Dude, I specified my main girl
walked out for a reason.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
I've still got my side girls.
I'm not a loser.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
[YUUTA]
Mommy! Daddy!

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center

from Santa Claus!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
Wow! Good for you, Yuuta!

Yo, Uramichi!

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
Uh. Do I wanna know why you have
a mountain of creepy plushies?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
Merchandising had
them sent here.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
You're both welcome
to take one, or more,

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
but please take at least one.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center

But we're finally home free.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
the official <i>Together</i>
<i>With Maman</i> page

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
for the channel's site.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
They're gonna need
to get pictures

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
of all the cast members.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
When do we do it?

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
Today.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Would this have even happened

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't said anything?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Nothing!

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
This freaking sucks.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Can you see how godawful
my makeup looks right now?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
What do you mean? You look
pretty, like you always do!

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
Aw, really?

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
No way, dude. Seriously?

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
Okay, I promise that was a joke.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
I realize now that
it was uncalled for,

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
and I'm very sorry.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
I-I didn't mean to say that.
Please don't hurt me.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
[UEBU] Hi. I'm Uebu
from Digital Planning.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
Taking the picture.
Three. Two. One.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50% align:center
[rapid clicking]

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
[UEBU]
These will be fine.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your time. Bye.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
Hey. Where's Uebu?

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
He just walked out.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
Jeez, in and out already?

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
Seems like youngsters these days
don't know how to socialize.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI sighs]

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
So, hey, Uramichi!

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
Year end party.
We gonna see ya there?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
When is that again?

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Right.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
But the new guys haven't gone
to a single social function

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
since they were hired.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
I figured I could ask
you to invite 'em

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
to the company holiday party.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
I don't want to.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
So, the new guys are
Uebu, who just left,

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
and Kikaku from over
in Merchandising.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
Then I really don't want to.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
Thanks a million!

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hey. Hold on.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
I'll be sure to tell the GM

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
that you were more than happy

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
to take full responsibility
for getting them to show up.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Uh--

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I'm not doing crap
until I change and have a smoke.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C]
Uramichi Oniisan is coming out!

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
It is him! <i>Konnichiwa</i> !

<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
Did you leave something?

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I tried to ask them
not to impose on your time.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
Children, am I right?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
No worries!

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
Um, I have something that
I really need to tell you

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
before we leave!

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
It's that we had a
super fun time today!

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll keep doing
your best at work, Oniisan!

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C, BOY B]
Bye-bye!

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
[GIRL C, BOY B giggling]

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Like fresh water
soothing a dry throat.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Or medicine clearing
up a nasty cold.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
There are moments
that breathe life

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
into even the most
exhausted heart.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA] I know that job's
in good hands, Uramichi!

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
Thanks! Always glad to help!

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
He's not as complicated
as he seems, is he?

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
He really isn't.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
[UEBU]
A holiday party? No thank you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
Hey, asshole! How many
times do I gotta tell you?

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
If the pitch hasn't
even been approved,

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
then the product doesn't
need a preorder page

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
on the damn web store!

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
Who'd've guessed Uramichi
Oniisan would be here?

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
How's your day goin', bud?

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Decent? By the way,
are you going to--?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Son of a bitch! What did
I say like 15 seconds ago?

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
This thing doesn't exist,

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
and if there's any good
in the world, it never will!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
Just because someone
dropped this steaming heap

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
in a pitch meeting
doesn't mean anyone's

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
gonna pay money for it!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
[UEBU] But they are.
Preorders are pouring in.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU] From who? What the
hell is wrong with people?

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
[UEBU]
There's another one.

[KIKAKU]
Has the whole world gone ins--?

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Scary.

Now, I'd like to thank everybody

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
for their hard work throughout
these past seasons.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
And after that, we can
all enjoy the festivities

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
and be done thinking
about work for the year.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it if you all
would join me for a toast.

Hey, guys.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
We gonna get to see some
back handsprings this year?

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
I tweaked something in
my back again yesterday.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
Can we save it for
next year, please?

for my behavior last time.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
Oh, not in the least.
I should apologize.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I've seen
several of your plays.

Have you, really?
I'm happy to hear that!
