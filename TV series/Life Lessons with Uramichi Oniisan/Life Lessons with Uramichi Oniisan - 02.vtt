I'm sorry. I didn't mean it!

That was the script.

fire me if I didn't say it!

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
That, I did say.

[KUMATANI]
Who said I was faking anything?

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
I did have heart palpitations

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
and a headach and
abdominal pain and nausea

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
and dizziness and
hallucinations,

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center

Aren't you being a bit judgy

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
about people's
hobbies, Kotori- <i>san</i> ?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
As long as we're on the subject,

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
why don't you tell
everyone about yours?

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Huh? We're still going?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
Is he just gonna pretend
nothing happened?

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
And you can't say "reading"

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
or "watching movies"
or "listening to music."

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
You see, when a
grown-up's "hobbies"

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
amount to consuming
mass-market entertainment,

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
those aren't really hobbies,

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
they're just distractions
from their mediocre lives.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
Imagine going to a
mixer and saying,

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
"Hey, we're into the same
stuff!" as an icebreaker.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
But then it turns out
she's into it into it,

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
and you can't keep up.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
You hope she doesn't notice

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
till she comes back
from the bathroom

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
and sits down way at the
far end of the table.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I can picture it.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
And that makes you realize

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
that you really
would be better off

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
if you went out and
mastered some new hobby.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.533 position:50% align:center
But ten years of adulthood
have sapped you

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
of the curiosity and drive
you would need to learn how.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Yeah. I feel that.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:33.790 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
When we're children,

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
we see the wall called
"adulthood" in front of us,

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
and we think, "Someday, I'm
gonna climb over that wall,

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
and then I can do
whatever I want!"

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
But then we get to
the top of the wall,

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
and we don't have enough
energy left from the climb

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
to survive on the outside.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
So remember, kids,
whenever you find yourself

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
feeling trapped,
feeling suffocated...

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center
...that's okay!

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
Fish get eaten in the ocean,

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
and they choke on their own
waste in undersized tanks.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
If you're not dead, that means
society's done its job!

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
The end!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center

Yes. I'm fine.
Sorry to bother you, sir.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
So you want me to
find you a big one?

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
Right, biggest stick they got?

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU laughing]

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
So big and hard.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
[SUGOI]
But by the time I noticed,

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
I had already fallen asleep!

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
Then wake up!

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
[DOI]
Anyway...

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
[SUGOI]
That's us.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Thank you for coming out today!

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
We're the Kadoma Amigos!

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
Huh? What was that?

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
Hold on, it's really
loud in here!

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
I tell you what, I'm gonna
step outside real quick!

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Huh? You caught some?
Nice, party at Uramichi's!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
Huh? Do what?

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Nah, I figured I'd quit
while I'm behind.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
It's not like he'll be
doin' anything anyway.

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
Liftin' alone. Drinkin' alone.
Makin' curry alone.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
That's his life.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, bud!

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
Dunno if you knew, but my
parents run a liquor store,

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
so the booze is on me.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
Also, I grabbed a cro-yaki
by the pachinko place.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
Like a croissant <i>taiyaki</i> ?

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
I don't really have
much of a sweet tooth.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
More for me then.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
Thanks for havin' me!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh, it sounded like Kumatani

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
would be gettin'
here pretty soon.

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
So what are you
up to this Sunday?

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Not a lot. I just hit the gym.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Heh. Called it.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Huh?

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Huh? Uh. Nothing.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, what time is it?

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
I think the afternoon
rebroadcast might be airing.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.583 position:50% align:center
And that'll bring us to
our last letter for today!

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
From three-year-old Tohru- <i>kun</i>
of Ehime Prefecture...

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, man! It's almost over
already. That sucks.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, hey, that
must be Kumatani!

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
Guess we're puttin' this
conversation on ho-- Ah!

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA crying]

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uramichi. Gym etiquette, bro.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
I know you live here, but, man,
you gotta rack your weights.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone! Wasn't
today super <i>tanoshii</i> ?

00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Holy crap, dude.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
I've never been
in this much pain.

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
What's this?

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
We have to go away now,

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
but we hope you'll come play
with us again someday!

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:11.831 position:50% align:center
--[bang]
--[USAHARA screams]

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:12.832 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You gonna keep doing that?

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA screams]

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
All right, kids, till next time!

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
This is serious.

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure my toes are
broken. Uramichi, please!
