[USAHARA yawns]

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
I'm beat.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center
So, you're sure about that?
I mean, it's a pretty big move.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:03.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I just don't think
I can keep it up anymore.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.001 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
Huh. I see.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.545 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yeah.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.257 position:50% align:center
So then, I'm out at
the end of this month.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.800 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
Guess that's that.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure you'll be
able to find your way

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
to a place you
belong soon enough.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
I'll be pulling for you.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, man.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Wait, he's out?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.484 position:50% align:center
For real? Uramichi's out?

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Huh?

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
Maybe you missed something.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.658 position:50% align:center
You weren't there, bro!

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
He was making this
super serious face.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
He's gonna give up being a
gymnast Oniisan, I know it!

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA groans]

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] It was such a
shock hearing him say it.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
At first, I wondered
if I was dreaming.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
Well, you know him
better than I do,

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
but he never struck
me as the type

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
to just walk away from a job.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
Yo, dude, come on!

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
Digging all the peanuts
out of it is not cool!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA sighs]

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] I'm seriously
gonna miss that nutjob

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
if he bails on us.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
We do go back a pretty
long ways, huh?

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
Uramichi! Please don't go!

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Who are you even yelling at?

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
When I think back,

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
it's crazy how things just
happened to come together

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
like they did when
you guys met him.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
Man, those were the days.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
Kinda weird thinkin' about it.
That one coincidence.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Dude, this is the
last favor I'll ever ask!

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
There are some serious
hotties comin' to this thing

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
and we need one more guy.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
I only need you to meet
us at the first place.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
I'll even pay for
your dinner, okay?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
So come socialize for
once instead of studying

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
or plucking your bowstring!

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
I don't want to.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Awesome! Meet me at 8
in front of the station! Bye!

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Uh. Hey!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
You putz.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] 'Scuse me.
I think you dropped something.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Huh?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry about that.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
All good.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Also, do you have the time?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Uh. Yeah. It's 1:22.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
Great, thank you
very much! See you!

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] He definitely
had a watch on. Weird dude.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] So, like, what do
you do in your spare time?

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Uh. I'm kind of into movies.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
No way! I am super into movies!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's cool! So have you
seen anything good lately?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I mean, uh...
Where to start?

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
What's that one I saw?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
<i>Red Flamingos</i> !

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
And <i>One Flew Over</i>
<i>the Shrike's Nest</i> !

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what a flick.
Basic stuff, I know.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Nah, those're great!

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
And, hey, I mean,
who doesn't love bird movies?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
Total classics, those two.
With the guy and... that lady.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN C]
Kumatani?

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm just getting a vibe

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
like you feel out of place on
this whole group date thing.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
And, to be totally honest,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling pretty out
of place here, myself.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you and I
could go somewhere else?

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I have class tomorrow.
I should leave.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
Uh, already?

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Thanks for the invite.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Huh? Kumatani,
you're bailing now?

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry, ladies! I, uh,
f-forgot about something!

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA sighs]

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
Man, I wish I was funny.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
How does a guy keep a cute girl

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
interested in a
conversation, anyway?

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm totally stumped.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
Knowing enough about something
to actually have a conversation

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
would help a lot with that.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
You don't have the attention
span to watch a two-hour movie.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
Totally unrelated. Got the
Sports Science homework?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
Huh? You mean the one
that's due tomorrow?

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It's the last
favor I'll ever ask!

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
How many "last favors"

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
would that make, exactly?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Friendship's not about
keepin' score, man! C'mon.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Don't even try with that crap.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Come on, Kumatani!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Gross.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
You are so cold.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
And Nekota's pretty much gonna
be a stranger from now on.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
"Later, guys, I'm movin' out of
the dorm to live with my GF!"

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
I'm so frickin' jealous!

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I hope we get
another roomie soon

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
'cause being alone
with you is torture.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
Harsh, bro. Hey, by the way,

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
did you see that banner
they had hanging up?

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] That Uramichi Omota's
some kinda big shot, right?

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
Like, I don't know much about
gymnastics, but he's gotta be.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
It seems like you don't
know much in general.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think I saw
him in the cafeteria.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
Who's comin' by this late?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
What's up, Mister Super?

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
Sorry for coming
by here so late,

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
and for not giving more notice.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
We're renovating the east dorm.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
We're going to be
starting work tomorrow.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
Since a bed just
opened up in your room,

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
we were hoping to put one of the
residents with you for a bit.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
I think we'd be okay with that.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER A] He's a few years
ahead of you, but don't be shy.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
I guess we're roommates.
I'm Uramichi Omota.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Ugh...

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA hiccups]

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uramichi, you dumb idiot.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Are you gonna get up?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm leaving.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
You know I've always
looked up to him.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna puke.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Bro! What the hell was that?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, crap!

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
For real. What can
I do about this?

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Uramichi.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
I've looked up to him ever
since our college days,

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
and I still do.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
And now we get to work
in the same place.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
Not that that can't
be nerve-wracking,

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
but at the end of
the day, I enjoy it.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
I feel that.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
And honestly,

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
whatever kind of brilliant
gymnast he might be,

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
you know everything else
is a struggle for him.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] You'd lose a few
teeth if he heard you say that.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I'm not makin' fun of him.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to be real here.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
Gymnastics is kind of
all the dude's ever had.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
Last one!

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA grunts, groans]

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A]
Tobikichi! Are you okay?

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this hurts.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
That feels like a sprain.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A] Oh, man, that sucks.
Should we call someone?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
Nah, I think I can just put
ice on it. It'll be fine.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure. I'll grab a bag.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
The summer of my freshman year.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Huh? Whoa,
that's a lotta rain clouds.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] My roommate was
the biggest deal on campus.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
But we'd barely
talked to each other.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A]
Hey...!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] And the renovations
to the east dorm

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
were almost finished.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA sighs]

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A] So is it true
what I've been hearing?

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
Are you really roommates
with Uramichi Omota?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
Bet you never
would've guessed, right?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, I would
love to meet him.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Huh? Why do you want to?

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
Um, because he's gorgeous?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
I wish I could've been
the gymnastics manager

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.304 position:50% align:center
instead of track and field.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
Seriously? That's the
kinda guy you're into?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
I guess so?

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Ask him if he's got a
girlfriend for me, okay?

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
No way he doesn't, right?

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
I mean, he couldn't
not have one!

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
So... question.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Nope.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
Damn, bro.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
Reporting live from the field!

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
The massive typhoon has
continued to build in strength

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
as it approaches Japan,

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
bringing heavy rain, with wind
speeds reaching as high as-- Ah!

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Ms. Doshabu, are you with us?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
Viewers, please stay indoors and
take all possible precautions.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Looks like it's
a total mess outside.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Yep.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Y'know, I wonder
if there are people

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
who would be out
in this on purpose.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
And there are!

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
Whoa, holy crap! Did somebody,
like, set off a bomb?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
I'll go check it out.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
Uh. Me, too.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Ouch!

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hm?

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Uh, go ahead.
I'll be there in a bit.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Cool.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA sighs]

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER A] It's the sacred
tree from the shrine out back.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.302 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Does that not seem
kinda ominous to anyone else?

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER A] We're
fortunate that the building

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
had been vacated for renovation.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
We would've had casualties
if there had been anyone inside.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
So there is that silver
lining, at least.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
Needless to say,

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
you won't be moving back
anytime soon, Uramichi.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Was this just random chance,

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
or was it some
act of divine will?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
So our campus's star had
no dorm to go back to,

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
and it wouldn't be rebuilt
till after his graduation,

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
meaning the three of us were
gonna be full-time roommates

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
until Uramichi finished school.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
That's how it started.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hey, Usayama? Usagami.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure you mean
me, and it's Usahara.

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
Tobikichi Usahara.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
Usahara... So, what did
you do to your foot?

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
Hm? Oh, yeah, I might have
twisted it in practice earlier.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I tried putting ice on it,
but it started swelling anyway.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Let me see.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
Whoa, slow down a sec.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] No breaks, but the
ligament might be messed up.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
Why not go to the hospital?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Well, it can't be that bad if
I can still walk on it, right?

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Um...

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
Are you not worried?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
A bad injury could be
the end of everything.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
Jeez, man. That's a
little overdramatic.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
At worst, it's the end of
my track and field days.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] He didn't scold me
or try to change my mind.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
But I didn't know what to
think of the childlike purity

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
in his eyes as he asked me.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] You should go
to this clinic tomorrow.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
The doctors there do good work.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Cool.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
By the way, have you
seen Kumatani around?

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Where'd he go?

[NURSE A]
Careful, now.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
I guess this means I'm gonna
have to learn to use a crutch.

Whoa, you've got a crutch!
Jeez, was it that bad?

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal,

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
but we wouldn't want
it getting any worse.

[MANAGER A]
Oof.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center

Hey, Uramichi!

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I went to the clinic
you recommended

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
and got all sorted out!

For some reason,

I kept thinking back
to those words.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
Maybe gymnastics was
everything for him.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center

his didn't reassure me.

All right!

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
Thinkin' about it this
much isn't gonna help.

terrified of him.

I'm serious.

Gymnastics is all
Uramichi has ever had.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] That's true,
but I guess that side of him

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
never really bothered me.

Easy.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
and it's been gettin'
lonely at home.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
Plus, I brought you somethin'.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Nice, thanks!

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA]
Whoa, you got a <i>kotatsu</i> ?

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the heater here
is kinda garbo,

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
and my parents were tryin'

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
to get rid of their
old <i>kotatsu</i> anyway.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA]
Score! Let's set it up!

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA] Ahh. So much
better than a space heater.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] And now you're
gonna be here all day.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
Where you off to?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
Gonna get a coffee.

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
Ooh, cocoa, please.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
Plum <i>kobucha</i> .

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
Hey. Kuma...

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
The name's Kumatani.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Kumatani.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] You've already
gone back to training?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Oh. Yeah.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Have you been
training alone over the break?

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
Eh.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
So you didn't go home, right?

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.966 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
What's up with him?

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
Usahara and the others treat
him like the campus superstar,

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
but when I actually
talk with him, it's...

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
...really uncomfortable.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I learned to be
cynical at an early age.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
I thought lying and
laziness made up

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
the bigger part of human nature.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
My grandad was a fisherman
and Dad was a chef.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
It may have been
that artisan spirit,

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
but the rules seemed to get
tighter at my house every year,

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
so I pushed back.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
I became a delinquent.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
[DELINQUENT A]
Yo!

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
I don't recommend it.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
It's best to have something real

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
to devote yourself
to when you're young.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
But dealing with
expectations sucked.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
[glass shatters]

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI'S DAD] Dammit, Mitsuo!
You little delinquent!

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
You realize they called your
mother into your school!

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI'S MOM] Honey, I'm
fine. Please, just let it go.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Of course, this was a low point

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
for my relationship
with my family.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
Hey, finally, you're home!
Video game time?

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] But I was still
close with my little brother,

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
like always.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
It was one random
conversation with him

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
that got me to join the Japanese
archery club at school.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
And that got me to stop
getting in fights

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
and defying my parents.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI'S BROTHER]
Mitsuo!

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center
You should join a club like
I'm gonna do in middle school.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Which one?

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
Not sure. I'll pick
one out of a hat.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I thought maybe
getting into a sport

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
could teach me something
about stoicism

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
and the traditional work ethic,

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
though the fact I was
expected to learn it

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
still pissed me off.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
You ass.

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure
where you're headed,

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
but I've gotta go
grab some groceries.

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
[URAMICI]
Huh?

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] That totally sounded
like an invitation, didn't it?

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Actually, you should
probably get back to the dorm.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
I can come with.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
So when you're
finished for the day,

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
what kind of things
do you do to relax?

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
What do you mean?

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
Right, never mind.

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
Is it hard being that
serious all the time?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm not
serious at all.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
Doing what's expected of you
isn't the same as being serious.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[SAYURI barks]

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI, URAMICHI]
Hm?

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Thanks for the assist.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
I wanna give her a name
as soon as we get back home.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Definitely.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I always thought
of you as the serious type.

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
Getting your papers turned
in on time and stuff.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I just don't
wanna come off as...

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
I think he was just lonely

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
after spending winter break
on campus by himself,

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
so he went grocery shopping
with me for the company.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
That's my guess.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Kumatani, where've you
been? I'm starvin' over here!

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
Hey! Happy New Year
to you, Uramichi.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're Uramichi Omota?

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
You know Kumatani makes

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
restaurant-quality
hot pot, right?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Don't volunteer me to cook.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Come on, of course
you wanna play chef for us.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
So you ready to work
in my kitchen, then?

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA chuckles]

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] And did you get
that paper finished yet?

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh, let's not talk about that.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
Ah, crap. My head's splitting.
I had way too much to drink.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Good morning.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A]
Good morning!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Hey. Morning, Uramichi.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Morning.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
You all right?
You look kinda pale.

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
What? Whoa, do I really?

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Don't tell me. Hangover?

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Not necessarily.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Here. They'll help your stomach.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, thanks a lot.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
But, like, you're
being weirdly nice.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
Am I? Didn't notice.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Yeah. So, did
something good happen?

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Hm. Guess so. I found
a good place for myself.

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Really?

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Maybe even
the best place for me.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Hey. Break a leg out there.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
Uramichi, are you
okay with this?

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think I'm good with it.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Usahara.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up?
You're staring at nothing.

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
Did you have to skip breakfast?

00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:13.500 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Barely even slowed down.

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
[UTANO, IKETERU]
Hm?

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:18.421 position:50% align:center
It's over. Uramichi's
quitting the show.

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.008 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Huh?
