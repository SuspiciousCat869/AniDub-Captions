00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Scripts come and go,
but I've only got one throat.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
[GOD] Uramichi Omota,
31 years old. Single.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
He works as a gymnast Oniisan.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
As an award-winning gymnast

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
with a degree in
physical education,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
his body is extremely
stable and balanced.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
Especially... when compared
to his emotional state.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
As of late, whenever
I raise my voice,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
I kinda feel something
get torn away.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
What's that?

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
My soul.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] I don't get it.
Why does he still work here?

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uramichi, you were a hero

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
at Sports Science University.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
As your juniors,
we both looked up to you.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
But now... Well, remember
what Professor Anzai told us?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
"If you give up early,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
the game'll be over
before it starts."

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
But it turns out there
are some games that go on

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
long after you've given up.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
Like the game we call "life."

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
That's a wrap for the day!

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
Way to go, everyone!
Good hustle!

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Where's our star?
He comin' out tonight?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Heh. Doubt it.
He's already gone home.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He does tend to be
the first one gone, huh?

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
You could call me two-faced,

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
but every adult has
a hidden side.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Don't rat me out.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Just pretend you didn't
see, okay, kids?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
[alarm beeping]

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Why? Why does
the sun keep rising?

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Welp, I don't know about you,

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
but I'm raring for
some ABC calesthenics!

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
Why not the [bleep]RAC Song?

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
Are you not fighting
them anymore?

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] That wasn't a fight.
It was a reckless provocation.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
Did I abandon my
principles overnight?

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Yes, because that's what
grown-ups do when they're weak.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
Good. Good. Now gather
around, everybody!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A] Is that your
real voice, Oniisan?

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Are you asking me if
I have to force myself

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
to sound this
relentlessly cheerful?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
No way, I'm happy!

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
[BOY D laughs]

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
That wasn't a joke,
ya lil goober.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Hey, Oniisan! Did something
good happen to you today?

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Of course not!

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
"Of course not!"

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
Also not a joke!

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
But if nothing good
happened to you,

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
then why are you smiling so big?

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] It's precisely
because I have nothing else

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
going for me that
I need to smile!

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
Behind my smile is the
knowledge that after this shoot,

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
I'll retire to a lifeless,
empty home,

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
where I'll sit and numbly wonder
why playing with you kids

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
is the only thing that
makes me feel alive.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
That last part was a joke!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
I may be alone, but I don't
think that makes me

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
some kind of anti-social
creep who's failing at life.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
Why, I often meet weird men
in bars, much older than me,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
who theorize that
a lifelong bachelor

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
is the happiest thing
a man can be.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
In other words... it doesn't
matter if you have a partner.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
You aren't actually a loser

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
until you let
yourself feel lonely.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
Like when you apply some
sports tape to your own back

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
and accidentally scrunch it,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.905 position:50% align:center
then stare at your own
dead-fish eyes for hours.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of
moment when loneliness

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
can knock you out cold.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
Did that happen?

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Mh-hm.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
My life is K.O. after K.O.--
with no ref to stop the fight.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan.</i>

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
Well? You ready? C'mon, kids!

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
Let's call Usao- <i>kun</i> the bunny
and Kumao- <i>kun</i> the bear!

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
And go!

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
What do we do? Go out sooner?

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
If we wait too long,
he's gonna get mad again.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I'm a pro, dang it!

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
I won't be threatened
into ignoring the script!

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Usahara.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI, USAHARA]
Huh?

00:12:56.776 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] We're coming!
We'll be right out! I'm sorry!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Hey, kids!

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
Our friends Mister Bunny
and Mister Bear

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
say they wanna play
a game with you!

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Yeah, that's okay!

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Wow!

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
You sure are lucky these kids
are so nice, Mister Bunny.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
What kinda game do you
wanna play, buddy?

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I...

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA RECORDING]
I want to play something

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
fun and exciting, hip-hop!

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI chuckles]

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
In that case, I've got
just the perfect thing!

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Seems to me that you and these
little rascals should play tag!

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
Bunnies are real fast,

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
so if you wanna catch him
you'll have to be relentless!

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA RECORDING]
I can't wait, hip-hop!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
And every time they catch you,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
you'll do something
funny for them, right?

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Okay, kids! Go crazy!

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[KIDS laughing]

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
Great hustle, guys!

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uramichi!

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
I know we're your juniors,
but you've gotta stop hazin' us!

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
That's just how I communicate.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Well, your method of
communication is dysfunctional!

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Goodness, Usahara.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
You're the one who's always
saying you wanna get funny.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I have never said that.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
I was just helping
you practice.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Never said it! Not once!

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
You say it whenever
you get drunk, silly.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
You think it'll make
you popular with girls.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
He's lying, right?

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
No, you say that a lot.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
No way.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Why not take off
your costume? Isn't it hot?

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Huh? Oh, um--

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] He says he doesn't
like to talk to you face to face

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
without getting drunk first
because your eyes are so scary.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
The hell, bro?

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
How can you stab me in
the back like it's nothin'?

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
We were never allies.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
This is ridiculous!

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
You kept your mask on
for the same reason!

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's his deadpan face!
That's the worst one!

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Ugh. Uramichi,
just gimme a hint.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to do, huh?!

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
Tobikichi Usahara, 28 years old.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.733 position:50% align:center
This man behind the bunny suit

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
was Uramichi's <i>kohai</i> ,
or junior, in college.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
He still uses a piggy bank.
It is frequently empty.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
C'mon, tell me.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, waiter? Could we
get a couple hot sakés?

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
Mitsuo Kumatani, 28 years old.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
Graduated from the same college
as Usahara and Uramichi.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
He's actually quite observant,

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
but he isn't the type to put
his perceptiveness to use.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
He wears the bear suit.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
And a couple saké cups, please.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] If I was funny,
I'd get all the girls.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
He needs some water.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
Bring us a big glass
of water, too, please!

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA snoring]

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
Thanks for joining us today!

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
We'll see you kids next time!
So take care until then!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
We hope you had fun!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
If you enjoyed the show,
then keep tuning in!

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Bye-bye!

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Bye-bye!

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[GIRL F]
Bye-bye!

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
Okay. Cut!

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
Great stuff, guys.
Another good hustle!

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[GOD] Iketeru Daga, 27 years
old. A singer Oniisan.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
He used to act in
musical theatre

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
and is a very talented
singer with a strong, deep,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
and objectively beautiful voice.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
He has the looks of a blue-blood
and the mind of a pig.

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
He loves crass, dirty jokes

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
and he's incapable of reading
a room or catching a hint.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
So, what time is it?

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Is that just a bracelet to you?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
[GOD] He also has a difficult
time with analog clocks.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
[GOD] Utano Tadano, 32 years
old. A singer Oneesan.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
She graduated from a
prestigious music school

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
and then proceeded to fail,
first as a pop idol,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
then as a singer of
traditional <i>enka</i> ballads,

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
and finally as a
nightclub jazz singer.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
Now she's here.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
[GOD] Incidentally,
she has now been living

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
with her unsuccessful comedian
boyfriend for over five years.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
I gotta get married.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
You hear me?

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Huh? 'Fraid not.
Had something on my mind.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
And cut! Such a good hustle!

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
Take yourself a break while we
set up for the next session!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Seriously, Uramichi is so-- Uh!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Suspicious and rude
as he's acting right now,

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
I just don't have the energy
to deal with him.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
This is heartbreaking.
I must be nearing my end.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Nothing?

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
I'm even more scared now.

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
As best I can tell,

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
it's when you stop fighting
that you start getting old.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
I don't mean that literally.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
It's more a question of
spirit than aggression.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
Struggle, hardship, and
competition help people grow.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
Even when we eat dirt.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
When that rabbit locked eyes
with me, then jerked away,

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
I knew what was going on.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
He was about to start
bitching about me.

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
First, he wanted to make
sure I wasn't around,

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
but I was around.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
He thought, "Oh, shit,
he's literally right there,"

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
and panicked.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
I'm used to that kind
of treatment by now,

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
so it's not that upsetting.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
What I do find upsetting

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
is how long it took
for me to react at all.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] It feels like the
things that happen to me

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
and my emotional response
to those things

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
have somehow drifted
out of sync.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
I still feel the seed of rage,

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
but it's been buried
by indifference.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
How's it going, Uramichi?

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Pretty good, Iketeru.
Please knock next time.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
Now, what brings ya here?

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
The physicist Richard
Feynman. You know him?

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Uh.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I've heard of him.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
He studied tiny particles
of light or whatever, right?

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Right.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
So, I only just found out
about him a little while ago...

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
...and I laughed so hard
I could barely breathe.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
'Ca-Cause his nickname, it...

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
It would be "Dick."

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
Dick Feynman.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU laughing]

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey!

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
If you guys are ready,
we should head on back.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Y'know Dick Shiner?

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Wait. Wait.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Dick Lord?

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU laughing]

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
Hm?

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
No, I'm okay.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Dick Hardwood.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU laughs]

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Please. You gotta stop.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
We're about to shoot.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
Dick Seaman.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU laughs]

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Seaman. Oh, no. No, no.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan.</i>

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
[EDEI] Okay. Let's get
back to it, people!

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there, kids!
<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
Are ya ready to create
some art with us?

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Iketeru Oniisan is
gonna join us soon.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
He just needs some time
to get it together.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
[BOY B] Is Iketeru Oniisan
not together right now?

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Nope, not even a little!

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
In fact, he's on the
verge of collapse.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
Learning moment, kids.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
If you don't make time for
breaks when you're at work,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
you'll end up burning out.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
That's when exhaustion
gobbles up your brain cells.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
Should we warn Iketeru?

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
It's too late for him.

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
[GIRL G]
That's so sad.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
Let's move along. Utano Oneesan!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna draw anything
in particular, today?

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
Since you asked, yeah!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
I was thinking we could
draw our friends today!

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't mind
going first, would you?

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Just draw one of your pals and
introduce them to the class!

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
You wanna meet my friend?

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Done!

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
What is this?

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I can't--
But why? Just why?

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Let me explain!

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
Technically, it's hard
to say if we're friends,

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
but I do know this little
bird man pretty well.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
He haunts my dreams!

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
So <i>kawaii</i> !

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Are you okay?

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
If I slip up and
admit that I'm not,

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
it'll jump to take
advantage of my weakness.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
There's no trace of
pity in those eyes.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should go
take a break, too.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan</i> ?

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
Okay, cut!

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
We're gonna call it a wrap
for the day, all right?

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
Great hustle, team!

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I mean, like, seriously.

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
What's Uramichi's deal?

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have a single hobby

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
aside from weight
training, right?

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
One of these days, I'mma sit
him down for a talk. Heh.

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
I'll let him know
that the reason

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
those muscles don't get him laid

00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
is cause he acts like
a mopey killjoy...?

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:21.966 position:50% align:center
[GOD] In that moment,
indifference was buried in rage!

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA screams]
