00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
Green means go, but even
if the light says "go,"

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
you can't always trust it!

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
Just 'cause the signal is
telling traffic to wait for you

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean the
drivers will listen,

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
so remember to look both ways,
green light or not!

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
That's true in life, too!

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center

somewhere they wanna be,

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center

The crosswalk signal has
a blinking green light,

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
but they both mean "stop."

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
That's important.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
They don't mean "go with
caution." Just stop!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center

It means "you need to stop,
or someone's gonna get hurt"!

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, even the
tiniest lapse in judgment

can ruin entire lives!

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
get out of the road
and stay put, okay?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
Even if everyone at the
crosswalk starts crossing,

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center

don't move for anything.

Did you ever have something

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
you dreamed of doing,
Uramichi Oniisan?

00:09:58.682 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
A dream?

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
I did. I played in
a band for a while.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
Then, one of my
bandmates told me

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.106 position:50% align:center
he was tired of
chasing stupid dreams,

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
and we all ended up going
our separate ways.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
Pretty soon after, I saw him on
some garbo late-night TV show

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
with a bunch of other
B-list comedians.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
I was in a four, five-year
relationship at the time,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
and the girl I was with

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
swore she was never getting
married or having kids.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
Guess she changed
right after we split,

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
'cause I saw on F(bleep)
she was posting wedding pics

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
and baby glamour shots.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
She made it very clear
when she walked out

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
she never wanted
to see me again.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
But recently, she found out
that I'd gotten a job at MHK,

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
so she reached out
to me to get her kid

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
into a <i>Together</i>

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center

is more fulfilling
the way it is now,

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center

little bit more at ease.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center

been chasing was actually

What do you wanna be when
you grow up, Uramichi Oniisan?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
I'm already a grown-up,

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
so the question is
"What did I wanna be?"

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, that's rough.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
So, then, what should
I do if I grow up

and my dream doesn't come true?

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say,
but one thing I do know

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
is that the longer you
carry a dream with you,

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
the heavier it starts to feel.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
Some people's dreams are
what keep them on track

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
to the place that they
belong in the world.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
Others only find their way

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
once they learn to let
their dreams go.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
So don't be afraid to
hold onto the dreams

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
you have now, and if
they get too heavy,

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
remember that it's all
right to leave them behind

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center

He's making these!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
And he said not to
tell the other kids!

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Wow, Kikaku.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan</i> .

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Hey, Nekota.
Can I vent on you for a minute?

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA]
Sure.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] So Uramichi sends
me to run some errands,

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
and I do, and he gets pissy!

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
And that friggin' sucks!

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
Like, okay, maybe
it's not so cool

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
that I took the change to the
pachinko parlor or whatever.

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
But I bought him
a taiyaki, okay?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
And that should
count for something.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Nekota, for real.
I'm not the bad guy here, right?

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
You're fine, Usahara.
Not the bad guy at all.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
I know, right?

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
That hurts.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I can at least count
on you to back me up on this.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Unlike this dude.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
Kumatani's all, "You couldn't
be more the bad guy here."

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
What the hell, man?

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
Still, though, I'm uber jealous.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
You're actually friends
with <i>the</i> Uramichi Omota.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
So not fair. Why couldn't
I have been his roomie?

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
We only ended up as his roomies
'cause you moved out, remember?

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
Yeah, to move in with
my girlfriend, bro.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
Better than living in a
sweaty dorm full of dudes.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
Speakin' of which, you guys
could use a marriage or two

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
under your belts.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
Doesn't adding the "or two"

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
kinda defeat the
purpose of marriage?

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
That's how you end up
with two ex-wives.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
And two child support
payments along with 'em.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
So, who wants another round?

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA]
Speaking of Uramichi,

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
was all that stuff I
heard about him true?

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
All what stuff?

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
You know, like knockin' out

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
an alligator barehanded
at training camp.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
Or having a fan club at the
girls' high school nearby.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
A fan club?

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
No way in hell Uramichi
had a fan club!

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
More likely than the alligator.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
The alligator totally tracks!

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Except there are
no alligators in Japan.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU] Ah! This is why I
said it's a waste of time

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
to try and talk it out!

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
You think I won't take
your ass to court?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, don't you
even think about it?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
The prick hung up on me.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
Give me five minutes with him.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
I'll crack open that
thick skull of his

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
and eat his brains
like a bowl of stew!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
Bastard.

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
Double tequila.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
You're quick.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh...

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
Hey! There's somebunny I know!

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
How does the scary merch
guy know who I am?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm Kikaku with the MHK
merchandising department!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
Is it the tequila,
or just boundary issues?

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
Help me, Kumatani!

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
Remember when we were little?

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
We'd be way out in the woods

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
digging up roly-polies,
looking for <i>tsuchinoko</i> .

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA] Oh, man. Summer
break was the best, right?

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
And anytime you flipped over
a rock, there would--

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
Bro! I need a way outta
this conversation!

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Do I know you? Back off.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
Don't destroy what faith
in humanity I still have!

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
Sir, why are you touching me?

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
Hey, bud, let's
hippity have a drink

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
while you tell me about your
whole philosophy on life!

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
That's not really first
conversation material.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's the tequila,

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
but your way of breaking the
ice feels a little bit off.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan</i> .

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
[KIKAKU]
You're pretty good friends

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
with Uramichi Oniisan, right?

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
We've known each other a while.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
"Friends" might not be
the right word to use.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
But even if you know
someone really well,

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
there'll always be some things
you might never know.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
I ran into him once.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
(bleep) r Us,
if you can believe that.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh. Doing what?

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
I thought about saying
something to him...

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
...but then I noticed he was
taking a very close look

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
at a bunch of little
girls' dress-up dolls

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
and checking out accessories.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
He ended up buying a few dolls
and some cute, frilly dresses.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
And I'm not sure I was
supposed to see that.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA sighs]

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess what a guy
does on his own time

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
is his own business, right?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm really glad that I
learned that about him tonight.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
Now I know he
wouldn't take offense

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
if I pitched an Uramichi
Oniisan dress-up doll.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
A what? And who's the
target demographic?

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
Not sure, but hopefully nobody.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA] Man, I don't wanna
judge, but it is a shock.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
This is Uramichi, of all people.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
I thought I knew the guy,

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
but that caught me
completely off guard.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a
weird day at work.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Now my buzz is gone.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
Nekota! Gimme something girly!

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
[NEKOTA]
You got it.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
Ready, everybody?
<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
[GIRL F]
Hey, Oniisan!

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, hello there!

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
Look at my new dress!

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
My grandma bought it
for me! Do you like it?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It's super frilly,
and I think that's really cute!

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA gasps]

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
Usao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Is there some reason you've
been acting so weird today?

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Uh. Everything's great, hip-hop!

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[EDEI]
All right, let's call it a day!

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
Great hustle, everyone!

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
Hey, good work today.

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
You, too.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to ask you

00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
if everything went all
right with your niece

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
and her birthday present.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] Yeah, thanks again
for lookin' into that for me.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.742 position:50% align:center
I still barely know
what I bought her,

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
but apparently it was
the right thing.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
So, on another note,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
Usahara's been kinda
standoffish today. Any idea why?

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.921 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Damn, Uramichi. For real?

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:19.798 position:50% align:center
Say it ain't so, bro.

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:20.965 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Nah.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Thought I knew you, man. Ugh.
