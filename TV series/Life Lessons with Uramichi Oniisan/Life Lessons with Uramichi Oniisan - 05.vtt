Hey, Uramichi Oniisan?

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
Hey, buddy!

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
Um, my daddy said
that he got a day off

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
from work next week like
he asked, and so, uh...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
He told me he was gonna bring me

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center

gettin' to work on the weekend.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
I could be out on
the town with a girl.

[KUMATANI] Hypothetically,
if you had a girl.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center

[FURITSUKE] We're less than
an hour from go time, people!

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Oh, let's fix that

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

[USAHARA] Our choreographer
always gets so intense

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
when concert day rolls around.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Furitsuke is serious
about our concerts.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
That's why we keep running
rehearsals day-of.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Which, we maybe shouldn't

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.234 position:50% align:center
since the cast is half-dead
when the show starts.

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
That's it. I can take
a vacation after this.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
Use a little PTO.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
That rehearsal must've done
something to your brain

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
to make you think we get PTO.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
[UTANO] On the other side,
once this concert is over,

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get married.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center

So, hey, Iketeru Oniisan,

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
why don't you tell everyone
about something you're good at?

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Hmm...

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know! I'd say I'm
pretty good at singing!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
But you're totally lost
when it comes to reading

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
Well, that's not...
I mean... Yeah.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
Everybody has some
things they're good at

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
and some things they're
not so good at,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
and that's what makes
all of us special!

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
That's what our

Ow.

I didn't even know crabs
could be this small.

Yeah. You could walk down to

Is that where they

have an umbrella,

and it's going to keep
getting colder tomorrow,

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
