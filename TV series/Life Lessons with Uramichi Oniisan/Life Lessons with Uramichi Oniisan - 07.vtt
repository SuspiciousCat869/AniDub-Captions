00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
As an educational program,

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
we need a segment
for arts and crafts.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
Right? I'd been thinkin'
the same thing.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Right, so I was thinkin'
about it, and I had this idea.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
Right, right.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
[FURODE]
So, insects build their nests

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
out of little cut-and-pasted
leaf bits, right?

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
Huh. 'Zat right?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
Sure! I'm pretty
sure that's right.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
So we take Iketeru Daga
and Uramichi Omota

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
and we dress 'em up like bugs

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
and have 'em do
simple papercrafts!

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA]
Right!

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
And the kids and parents
at home can follow along!

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
[FURODE] And I figure we would
have Utano playin' the part

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
of the teacher for this
segment, don't you?

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
[DEREKIDA] Oh, yeah.
She's definitely the teacher.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
Nothin' about her says "bug."

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.598 position:50% align:center
[FURODE laughs]

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
Look at these costume
designs I came up with.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Heh.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
[FURODE]
Ha! Right? Ha-ha.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.949 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Crafting with Maman!

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
Hey, kids!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
Today, we're gonna do a fun arts
and crafts project together!

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
[KIDS laughing]

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:48.460 position:50% align:center
And what we're making is this!
Do you know what this is?

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
[GIRL L]
Chains?

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
Like the ones that will bind us
when we reach adulthood?

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
Exactly right!
It's a pretty necklace!

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
So let's have some fun
making necklaces together!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
We can make those?

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
How do we do that?

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
Now, hold on.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
Before we get things started,

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need some help
from my trusty assistants.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> !

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
That's me!

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
The longhorn beetle.
I'm Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> !

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
And I'm really good at going
"snip, snip" with my scissors!

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
If I got a chance, I'd snip
this whole world apart.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
But I always snip within
the bounds of the law!

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
For if I were ever to snip
away my sense of restraint,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
well, then my life
would be snipped short!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
[KIDS laughing]

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
Okay, kids!

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
Time to introduce you to my
other assistant: Uramino- <i>kun</i> !

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
That's me!

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
Hi, my name is Uramino- <i>kun</i> !

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
I'm a bagworm, and I love to
stick things together with glue!

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
But I really hate when people
try to stick labels on me.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
Aren't your legs getting
cold, Uramino- <i>kun</i> ?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
They're freezing!

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
I wish I could just stitch
myself into my bag

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
and wait for death.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Great! Our assistants are here.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
And these are the
materials we'll need!

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
Get some paper and some glue.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
You'll need scissors, so have
a grown-up with you, too.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
For the first step,
cut an origami sheet

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
into four long,
evenly-sized strips.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Show us how, Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> !

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI, UTANO]
Huh?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
[UTANO chuckles]

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Ooh, looks like you got

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
a little nervous there,
Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> !

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
We wanna cut it into long
even strips, just like these.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
You can do it!

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
we all make mistakes.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
But if they're mistakes
you can fix,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
you should fix 'em
and keep going!

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Sorry.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Uh?

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
It looks like
Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> 's scissors

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
are having a bit of
trouble going snip-snip!

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's it.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
I can't read an analog clock,

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
but I could fake it well enough
to make it through a scene.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Are you okay?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
This role. This longhorn beetle.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm completely
out of my depth!

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
I found a personal weakness that
I can't cover up with my acting!

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
[UTANO] Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> , you're
putting way more of yourself

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
into this role than
it can support.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
I can't do this.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
to play this bug!

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
Dude, you can't take a deep
dive into the kiddy pool.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
This isn't helping anyone.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
You totally look
like a cockroach

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
when you're doubled
over like that.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Kumao- <i>kun</i> ! Emergency
mental support, please!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Everything's
<i>daijoubu</i> , bud!

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
Take a sip of water
and a deep breath.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
Whatever kind of
longhorn beetle you are,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
you're still totally valid.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
Just 'cause they're bugs
doesn't make them the same.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
You can be yourself and
still be a longhorn beetle!

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
How did so many freakazoids

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
end up on this one show?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
[GIRL D] Uramino- <i>kun</i> , what's
wrong with Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> ?

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Hm. You see,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
good people usually try
and live up to expectations

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
of people around them,
and when they fail,

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
their self-image is shattered
and their brains go all wacky.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
You kids might have some
rare hidden talent yourselves,

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
and that could get a lot of
people's attention someday.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
But those people
don't define you.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're the one
in charge of your life.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
And sure, there may be moments

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
when your paths through
life cross, or even merge,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
but others can't
carry your burdens,

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
and you'll separate
again in time.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
When we reach the end of
our road, we're alone.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Children, listen well.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Don't try to live for
somebody else's sake...

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
...or you'll end up like me.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
Whose sake does Utano
Oneesan live for?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI] I'm not at liberty
to talk about that.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
[UTANO] Wow, you all did such
a good job making those!

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
And how about our
friends at home?

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Did your necklaces
come out good?

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
Then go get 'em!

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
I apologize, kiddos.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to have
a meltdown like that.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
You're allowed to give
yourself a break.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] I hope you can forgive
me, too, Uramino- <i>kun</i> .

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
What's to forgive?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
Kamiteru- <i>kun</i> ,
it's great that your talent

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
can bring joy to so many people.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
But sometimes, it's better
to keep expectations low,

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
'cause life is easier that way.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
Uramino- <i>kun</i> .

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
You lost me.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
--[EDEI] Great hustle, today!
--[KAYO] You, too!

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU] Sorry, but I was
hoping you could teach me

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
how to cut paper like that.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Sure thing.
Watch how I do it, okay?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
You're a sharp guy, Iketeru,

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
you'll catch on quick.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI] Hey, could you
shut up for a minute?

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
[USAHARA]
Dude, why can't I talk?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
[KUMATANI]
He needs to focus.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU sighs]

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
So, practice paying off for ya?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50% align:center
Well, it's nothing special,
but I managed to make this.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
What is this guy?

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[URAMICHI]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan</i> .

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Time for our show!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
I'm Iketeru Oniisan!

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
And I'm Utano Oneesan!

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
Now that we're here,

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
what kind of song do
we wanna sing first?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
[UTANO]
Uh... Iketeru Oniisan?

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
[IKETERU]
Uh. Um...

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
