but sometimes she can't
remember people's names!

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:56.500
The other day, I was with
her at the supermarket...

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.625
...and there was a man
buying pickled mackerel

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.500
and burdock root and
it looked like milk,

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:03.417
but Mommy said it was alcohol
that comes in a milk carton.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.709
And me and Mommy thought we'd
seen him somewhere before,

but we didn't know where.

00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:09.959
And Mommy said she couldn't
remember who he looked like,

00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:12.333

and I finally said,

"He looks like Uramichi Oniisan
from <i>Together With Maman</i> !"

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.291

You know, I've never
actually played this game.

00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:01.667
Oh, crap, hold on a sec.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.458
Iketeru, listen.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.542
Okay.

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:05.959
These guys go into
serial killer mode

00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:07.583
whenever there's a competition.

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.583
Okay.

00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:11.208
So, what are we waiting for?

00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:12.834
You two scared or somethin'?

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:14.166
Utterly terrified.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.083
I don't know why I
suggested ping pong.

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:20.458
Protecting your face
is priority one.

00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:21.709
Huh?

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.500
[IKETERU]
Here goes.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.208
[KUMATANI]
Not bad for your first time.

00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.166
But not good enough for me!

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.750
[gasps]

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:35.959
[IKETERU]
This is hard.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.875
[USAHARA] They're like
wolves circling a lamb.

00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:41.166
[KUMATANI] Widen your stance.
Don't lock your knees.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.417
It isn't about your hands.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.875
You have to turn your
whole body into the hit.

00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:46.625
Like that?

00:19:46.709 --> 00:19:49.083
But your mindset
matters most of all.

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.792
So I need you to
imagine you're a pro

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:52.834
playing your farewell match.

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:54.333
[gasps]

00:19:54.417 --> 00:19:55.875
Let's go!

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:04.834
Yeah. That's great!
Just like that!

00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:08.125
What can't he do? Damn.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.041
[IKETERU grunts]

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.250
[UTANO]
Hi.

00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:12.000
So, picking it up with
a tissue and tossing it

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.875
would've been way faster
than all those texts.

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:16.625
Well, sadly, I took the bus,

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:20.625
but I'm sure you can deal with
the big scary stinkbug yourself.

00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.500
[UTANO groans]

00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:26.458
Seriously, it can be
pretty hard to like a guy

00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:28.291
who can't even deal
with a bug on his own.

00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:31.959
I guess it's not exactly
a point in his favor.

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:32.959
[KAYO gasps]

00:20:33.041 --> 00:20:34.959
Eww, stinkbug!

00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:37.417
[UTANO] Gross, did it hear
us talking about it?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.083
[IKUKO] Oh my gosh,
where are the tissues?

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.875
[FURITSUKE]
Beyond man and woman

00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:53.333
lies the irresistible
power of a queen.

00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:54.583
[UTANO]
My queen.

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:56.542
[IKUKO, KAYO]
My queen.

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.375
Dang, I'm gonna pass out!

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:01.208
[KUMATANI]
That was a pretty close game.

00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:04.333
[USAHARA] Mainly because
of Iketeru's hidden powers.

00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:05.959
We worked up a sweat.

00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:07.667
Maybe we should go
take another soak.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.000
Hell yeah, bro.

00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:12.917
[URAMICHI] These are gonna
be some weird muscle aches.

00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:17.166
[KUMATANI] I heard
<i>Man-Eating Salmon Three</i> 's

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.291
gone into production.

00:21:18.375 --> 00:21:19.959
[URAMICHI]
Yeah? When's it coming out?

00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:21.500
[USAHARA]
Ah! A stinkbug!

00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:22.709
Huh?

00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:25.792
What about it? Don't
freak out over a bug.

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.250
[USAHARA] They move all
weird and it's gross!

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:31.208
That thing's crawlin' all over
the only towel I brought!

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.834
Just leave the stupid towel.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.625
The bug will fly off
before we're done.

00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:35.875
Are you kiddin' me?

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:37.959
What, I just gotta
hang dong until then?

00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:40.583
[IKETERU]
Dong. Hang dong?

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:41.417
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.583
[IKETERU laughing]

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:45.000
[URAMICHI]
Look at that. You got a laugh.

00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:47.458
[USAHARA]
Wasn't looking for one.

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:48.959
[URAMICHI] And then a death
stare from the guy

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.250
right next to him.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:52.583
[USAHARA]
Wasn't lookin' for that either.

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:03.333
So... penis?

00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:07.125
[IKETERU chuckling]

00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:09.208
[IKETERU]
He just...

00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:10.875
...just said it.

00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:15.125
[USAHARA] I wonder if that
stinkbug flew off by now.
