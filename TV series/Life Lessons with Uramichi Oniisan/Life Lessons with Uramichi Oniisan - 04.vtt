00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:11.542
[NEWSCASTER A]
And now, the weather.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.041
Multiple stations across Japan

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.041
are reporting record
low temperatures.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.625
Including below-freezing
temperatures in some regions.

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:20.709
Anyone traveling is advised
to prepare for winter weather.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.458
Okay! Excellent.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.000
How are we this morning, team?

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.250
Today, we're shooting a music
video that's all about summer,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.250
so we can air it in the summer.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.458
But it'll take a while
'cause the videographer

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:37.959
is particular about his work.

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.709
That is brisk!

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:45.458
So, anyway, point is,
we gotta get this done.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.333
The song's called
"Long, Hot Summer."

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.417
So I'm gonna need you all
to look like you're havin'

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.208
a summery good time, cool?

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:57.166
All right! It's time
to get summery, team!

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.125
Remember, your body
language needs to be

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:01.208
warm and sunny, right?

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.709
Make me feel it!
Make it burn me!

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.667
[DEREKIDA]
That is brisk.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:10.709
[USAHARA]
Ah, on days like this,

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm actually glad
that they stuck me

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.917
in the big ol' fuzzy
bunny suit, y'know?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.542
Makin' someone do this shoot in
a tank top is a form of torture.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:23.000
Ah! Stop! Stop! Don't stick your
icy death hand in my neck hole!

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.875
Too much. Too much.
I can't. I can't...

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.709
You are one a heck of a
trooper, Uramichi my boy.

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:31.417
There were definitely
some decisions made

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.834
that could make this shoot
a bit tough on you.

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.417
Nothing tough about it.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.583
[DEREKIDA]
Great! Really? You're not cold?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.417
Nope. I'm not.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.750
Oh, wow, Uramichi
is really amazing.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.917
I figured I had built up
a decent amount of muscle,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.458
but I guess it's not enough.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:52.834
I'm still cold.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:54.166
[KUMATANI]
No, yeah.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.375
I don't think even Uramichi's
muscles are enough

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.333
to fight this off.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.166
[USAHARA] They're not, but
he's too stubborn to admit it.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.834
His hand was like an ice
cube against my neck.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.250
I am not bothered in the least.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.208
[USAHARA]
You'll see the goosebumps

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.166
if you look close enough.

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:13.625
The sea's big.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.083
[USAHARA]
You hear that?

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.750
The vocabulary part of his
brain is getting frostbite.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.041
[USAHARA]
<i>Uramichi Oniisan.</i>

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:23.333
[EDEI] To really sell
the summer feeling,

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:26.125
we wanna shoot you
smashing a watermelon.

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:29.291
But we don't have one, seeing
as it's not actually summer.

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:30.667
[URAMICHI]
That checks out.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.625
So I bought a winter gourd!

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.959
Winter gourd.

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.250
[DEREKIDA]
Draw some wavy lines on it

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:37.875
and we're most of the way there!

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.709
Squeak, squeak...

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:42.834
Oh! Ha. Who could even tell?

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.291
[DEREKIDA]
Man, that's brisk.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.333
[UTANO, IKETERU]
Ahh...

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.542
[IKETERU]
Huh?

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.500
That's a watermelon
if I've ever seen one!

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:52.375
Hey. What is it?

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:53.583
I need you to say:

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.542
"Better idea, how 'bout
I smash your head?"

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.750
Oh, okay. Better idea,
how 'bout I--?

00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:01.166
[KUMATANI] Slow down a sec.
Try not to get yourself fired.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.667
That thing's gonna be way
harder than a watermelon.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.083
It won't work.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:06.500
[USAHARA]
Totally unrelated, uh,

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:07.750
what're you supposed
to be again?

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:10.083
I'm the sun spirit.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:11.709
[USAHARA]
Ah, it'll be fine.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.500
Uramichi can smash that
gourd like a raw egg.

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.834
You know he trains
for stuff like this.

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:20.166
It's basically the only thing
he does outside of work!

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.667
Better idea, how 'bout
I smash your head?

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.250
[USAHARA]
Sorry!

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.500
[USAHARA] This is supposed to be
an educational show for kids,

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:31.542
not a snuff film!

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:33.250
You'll wanna clench your teeth.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:34.875
[USAHARA]
He's plannin' to kill me!

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.041
The watermelon's just a pretext!

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:38.792
Huh?

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.166
Hey, cut it out.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.125
Don't act like I'm dead when
nothing's happened yet.

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:45.667
Well, he wouldn't have
wanted us to dwell on it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.792
Action!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.375
[UTANO] Little to your
left. A little more!

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:53.792
[KUMATANI]
To your left!

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:54.709
[USAHARA] Wait a minute,
when the hell are you three

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.375
ever on the same
page like this?!

00:03:56.458 --> 00:04:01.250
[USAHARA screaming]

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.750
[VOICE A]
Melon smash!

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:06.667
[USAHARA whimpering]

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.542
Just remember, I let you live.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.041
[USAHARA] I know you can
get away with saying that

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:16.291
since we're not shooting
audio, but please don't.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.250
Great! Now, then, moving on.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.750
This next scene goes over the
"lost track of the mosquito"

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:22.375
part in the chorus.

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:25.625
We've got the location,
so let's make the mood work!

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:28.959
You gotta be out there
havin' a beachy good time!

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.750
Y'know, like the movies!

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.333
Young people at the beach going
all, "Teehee!" and, "Haha!"

00:04:33.417 --> 00:04:35.375
splashin' each other!

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.166
What I'm saying is splash
water on each other

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.333
so I can shoot that.

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:41.166
[USAHARA screams]

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.667
[USAHARA]
"Long, Hot Summer"!

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.834
Great! Good work, gang!

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.500
Now that you're in
costume number two,

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:50.166
we're ready to start
shooting again!

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.417
No! Shut up!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.917
No, it's not too cold,
and no, you can't go home!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.750
But I haven't even
said anything.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.208
[EDEI]
All right, Team UsaKuma,

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:05.083
you'll be using
these water guns.

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:07.917
[USAHARA]
Huh? We're using the water guns?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.125
This is it. He'll kill us.
We need a plan.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:13.333
[KUMATANI]
My plan is to miss.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.083
[USAHARA]
Whoa, nice.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:21.083
The water's nowhere near him,
but it'll look great on camera!

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.959
[GOD]
On this day, at long last,

00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.375
the intense concentration
and elite motor skills

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.709
Kumatani had developed
through his archery training

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:31.583
would carry over from
college to his job.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.375
[USAHARA whimpering]

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.542
[USAHARA]
Okay.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.333
[USAHARA]
If I hit him, he'll kill me.

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:41.417
If I hit him, he'll kill me.
If I hit him, he'll kill me!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.291
[USAHARA]
Hyah!

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.333
[USAHARA screams]

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.208
[GOD]
On this day, as on many others,

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.041
the strong kinesthetic sense
which Usahara had developed

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:58.250
through his high-jump training
would prove entirely unhelpful.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:00.875
The shoot continued and
many more such hijinks

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.500
and pratfalls would ensue.

00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:07.417
[USAHARA]
I can't see in front of me.

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:12.500
Okay.

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:14.250
So the sun's set and we've
got a great night sky here,

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:15.417
which means it's time for

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.917
the "watching fireworks
in yukata" scene.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.250
But obviously, we don't have
nearly enough in the budget

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:23.166
for an actual fireworks show.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.417
We figured we could
just CG that part in.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.542
[ALL] Then why couldn't you have
just CGed the entire video?

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:31.917
Now, try and make it look like

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.250
there are fireworks
going off overhead.

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.917
Also, like you're having fun!

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.583
[UTANO gasps]

00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:45.667
[grumbles]

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.875
I don't feel like I'm looking
at people watching fireworks.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.625
You guys are professionals!

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.834
Make me believe you're
seeing fireworks!

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:56.750
What is that?!

00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.250
I don't even see even
a faint hint of summer

00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.709
in your expressions!

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:02.041
Give me more! Where's it at?

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.333
Come on, people! Summer!

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.208
[ALL gasp]

00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:09.458
[DEREKIDA]
That's the shot!

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:11.792
[EDEI] We're wrapped
on "Long, Hot Summer"!

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.709
Great hustle, everybody!

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:14.625
[URAMICHI]
I'm cold.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:15.709
[UTANO]
I'm hittin' the baths.

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:16.834
[IKETERU]
Huh?

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.333
[IKETERU]
Wha--?

00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:23.959
Guys, there's an actual
UFO right in front of me!

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.583
[KUMATANI] Iketeru is
hallucinating from the cold.

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.083
That's bad.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:29.875
[IKETERU]
No, just look!

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.667
[IKETERU coughing]

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.375
[IKETERU] I'm really sorry
for letting you down

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:43.875
like this, everyone.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:46.834
[IKETERU coughing]

00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:49.917
[IKETERU] I'm supposed to set
a good example for the kids,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.458
but in the end, I couldn't
even keep myself healthy.

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:58.166
I've failed as a
singing Oniisan.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.125
Easy, Sayuri, this is an
important conversation.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.792
[IKETERU coughing]

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:05.500
[IKETERU]
That tickles!

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:06.750
Well, now that we know

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:08.917
Iketeru will be out with
a cold for the day,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.166
it's time to figure out

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.959
what we're gonna have to
change for the taping.

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:14.917
[USAHARA]
Who's this Sayuri with him?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.208
[KUMATANI]
The dog.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.667
Instead of going on like normal

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.750
and hoping nobody
notices he's missing,

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:22.917
we thought we'd try working
this situation into the show.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.834
Huh? Do we really need
to do a full shoot?

00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:27.750
Isn't there enough footage
and music videos

00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:29.250
to make a clip show?

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.333
Getting through a full shoot
of <i>Together with Maman</i>

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:35.333
without Iketeru Oniisan here
is absolutely off the table!

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.333
[ALL]
Huh?

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:41.792
Do we want to teach those
kids that their <i>kyodai</i>

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.500
are interchangeable parts in
the entertainment machine?

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.166
I say we don't!

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.458
Let's teach them that
every person is precious.

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:52.875
Let's show them that no
human is replaceable!

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.291
That was terribly moving!
Good speech, Utano!

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.583
You're a lucky guy.

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:03.333
Sounds like your
coworkers have your back.

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:07.125
[IKETERU] Huh? Sorry,
I didn't catch a word of that.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.125
[IKETERU]
Hah! Sayuri, cut it out!

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.375
We're so glad to see you!

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.125
<i>Konnichiwa</i> !

[KIDS laughing]

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:25.458
Uh. Huh? Hey.
Where's Iketeru Oniisan?

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:27.250
He had to go somewhere
kind of far off,

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.083
and it's a very long trip,

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:31.875
but I promise he's right
here with us in spirit!

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:35.583
Slow down, Utano Oneesan.
They might get the wrong idea.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:38.375
Do you mean Iketeru
Oniisan is gone for real?

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:40.333
Did he finally get fired?

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:42.333
I feel bad for him.

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:44.542
[USAHARA] The guy was running
around half-naked on the beach

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.875
for a whole day in
the middle of winter.

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.500
The human body wasn't
built for that.

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:51.166
[KUMATANI]
Uramichi's fine.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.000
[USAHARA] Don't let the
hot-dude mask fool you.

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:56.000
He's a hundred percent
gorilla under there.

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.625
Sayuri, please, can I
have my blanket back?

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:03.250
[sneezes]

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:08.750
Oh, man, I'm freezing.
I think I'm gonna die.

00:10:08.834 --> 00:10:10.125
Hey, Iketeru,

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:12.500
are you going to have some
of the porridge I made?

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:15.083
[IKETERU]
Huh? Thank you.

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:20.834
[USAHARA]
Ah! It really hurts, hip-hop!

00:10:20.917 --> 00:10:23.000
Uh! What happened, Usao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:10:23.083 --> 00:10:25.542
[USAHARA] I fell down
and hoppity hurt myself.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.625
I hippity hope it
doesn't get infected!

Will you be okay, bunny?

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.083
That poor bunny rabbit!

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.291
I know just who to call.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.625

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:41.083
[USAHARA]
Hop. That voice!

00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:44.208
[URAMICHI] Jerminator won't
be coming to your rescue!

00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:45.709
You wanna know why?

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:47.542
He's been laid low
by the common cold,

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:51.458
thanks to none other than
yours truly, Bacterian!

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:54.667
[KUMATANI] What a truly
unbearable villain, grr!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.208
[URAMICHI chuckles]

00:10:56.291 --> 00:11:00.125
Call me whatever you'd like.
As for you, foolish rabbit....

00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:01.375
[USAHARA]
Huh?

00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:03.291
[URAMICHI] Now you will
understand what happens

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.500
when you call people gorillas
behind their backs.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.667
[USAHARA]
Wait. You heard that?

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.667
Ah! Please don't reach
into my neck hole

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.917
and pinch my cheek like a vise.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Oh, no!

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.875
Unless we can do
something to stop him,

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:20.166
Bacterian's going to
infect the whole world!

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.458
And yet, something isn't right.

00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:27.125
It's no fun unless he's
standing in my way.

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.500
Bacterian, I--

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:32.959
Could it be that I only
do all these bad things

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:35.792
just because I want somebody
to try and stop me?

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:37.333
So, for the attention?

00:11:37.417 --> 00:11:39.542
That's a toxic character trait.

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.291
[URAMICHI] I'll leave
you for another day,

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:44.458
when I can fight him
on even terms!

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.458
Don't become a big coward
like Bacterian, kids!

00:11:57.542 --> 00:11:59.166
Remember, there's
nothing courageous

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.625
about sticking to
your principles

00:12:00.709 --> 00:12:03.500
if you're only doing
it out of obsession!

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:06.583
If your real goal is just to
have somebody to compete with,

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.166
you've already lost
the competition

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.417
before it even began.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.709
So Bacterian is a loser?

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:14.125
He's a huge loser!

00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:15.875
He could've conquered
the whole world,

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:17.917
but he chose petty
rivalry instead.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.083
That was blunt.

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.000
This guy's ruthless.

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:22.875
There's no way you
can reach the stars

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.542
if you shackle yourself
to other people

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.166
with some misguided
fear of loneliness!

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.083
[USAHARA] I guess that's a
decent enough explanation

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.959
for his chronic singleness, huh?

Thanks.

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:58.542
I was having this dream.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:02.125
It was that time when I
caught a fever as a kid.

[IKETERU] Be careful not to
catch my cold, okay, Sis?

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.291
So what's with Iketeru?
Is he just kinda sickly?

00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:24.709
I heard he's caught fever easily
ever since he was a little kid.

00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:26.959
Huh? Maybe he is then.

00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:28.667
But he mentioned that
he's got his older sister

00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.667

They'll know there's some random
person in that bear suit.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.458
And that we lied!

00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:50.542
His fellow cast members would
know far more about Kumao - <i>kun</i>

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:51.959
than the crew would.

00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:53.500
Stop and think for a second.

00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:55.959
If anyone can imitate his
gestures and mannerisms,

00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:58.375
it's gonna be one of us!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.917
More specifically,
the most likely candidate

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.208
would be his college
roommate, Usahara.

00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:04.667
As the closest one to him,

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.583
you seem like the
obvious choice here!

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.542
[USAHARA]
Huh? Do I, though?

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:12.583
I mean, I wouldn't really
say he and I are close.

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:15.458
[KUMATANI] Are we gonna make
this a daily thing from now on?

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.041
Who knows?

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:22.417
You guys. I think Utano Oneesan
makes a really good point.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.125
[USAHARA] Okay, are you
getting in on the gag,

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:25.792
or did you miss it?

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.250
[gasps]

00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:28.625
[USAHARA] 'Cause Utano's face
is saying you missed it

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:32.417
and, uh, sent the show
completely off the rails.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.417
I would just hate
to make Kumatani sad.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.875
[KUMATANI]
That's definitely not an issue.

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.375
So let's try our best
to make it work.

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:41.792
After all, it's possible he
caught that cold from me.

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:44.834
[URAMICHI]
Wait.

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:50.750
[KUMATANI]
Hey.

00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:54.959
Sorry. I forgot and went
to the gym like normal.

00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:57.125
Jeez. Aren't you getting cold?

00:16:57.208 --> 00:17:01.041
Honestly, I barely noticed.
It's no big deal.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.542
Anyway, here's that movie.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:07.250
[URAMICHI] Thanks.
Don't get sick, all right?

00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:13.834
[URAMICHI]
Yeah... That would do it.

00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:21.291
[UTANO] So you wanna
know why I never shut up

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:23.500
about marriage, huh?

00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:26.000
It's 'cause nobody
else will, 'kay?

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:29.625
And every time it comes up,
I die a little inside.

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:34.125
Like, I know you can't tell,
but back in my 20s,

00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.917
I couldn't see myself as this

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.375
drunken, basic-ass 30-something
desperately chasing a ring.

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:44.041
[URAMICHI] Dude. Why would you
bring up marriage around her?

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:46.750
[UTANO] But that's what
I am now, I guess.

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.417
How did that happen?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.375
How did I turn into one of those
women I used to laugh at?

00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:56.875
How did I not notice until it
was too late? I had a chance...

00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:59.542
Please stop.
It's gonna get stuck.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:02.291
[UTANO] The world kept
pushing me toward mediocrity

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:05.959
and I don't have the strength
to push back anymore.

00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:09.166
Why's it so damn hard to live?!

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.125
[UTANO]
I'm oh-so sorry!

00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:15.917
It's just a bit chilly.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.208
Honestly, it's not
that of a big deal.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:21.709
B-But I pretty much just dumped
that whole beer on your crotch.

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:23.083
Sorry, for real.

00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:24.542
[KUMATANI]
It's 'cause our idiot coworker

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.542
had to ask that idiot question.

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.000
[USAHARA]
Huh? Who, me?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.041
[UTANO]
Yeah. That would do it.

00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:37.792
[USAHARA sighs]

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.417
Hey, there's snow,
Uramichi! Look at it!

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.041
There are even a few decent
piles on the ground!

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.166
Let's have a snowball
fight, you guys!

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.041
Let's not.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.375
[USAHARA]
Gotcha!

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:52.792
[USAHARA laughing]

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.667
Gotcha.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.750
Ah! Dammit, Usahara!

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:04.041
Shoulda payed more
attention, loser. Oh!

00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:05.458
[URAMICHI laughs]

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:07.125
[URAMICHI]
Direct hit!

00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:12.041
[USAHARA]
That'd do it.

00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:14.709
[ALL grumble]

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:16.291
Okay!

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.625
Kumatani couldn't be here today,
so let's all do this for him!

00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:20.417
[UTANO, USAHARA]
Do it for him!

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.875
[USAHARA
It's okay, Kumatani.

00:19:21.959 --> 00:19:24.208
I promise I'll do you proud!

00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:25.959
[UTANO]
That's right!

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.583
Today we're really gonna go
for it, for Kumao- <i>kun</i> 's sake!

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:32.625
[KUMATANI] Guys... you're
making it so much worse.

00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:34.750
<i>Konichiwa</i> , everyone!

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:36.333
Guess who came to play
with you today.

00:19:36.417 --> 00:19:38.083
Your bunny buddy, Usao- <i>kun</i> !

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:40.834
[USAHARA] Let's have
some fun, hip-hop!

00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:42.750
[BOY A]
Uhh...

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:45.333
Where's Kumao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:48.041
[URAMICHI] Actually, Kumao- <i>kun</i>
and Usao- <i>kun</i> had a big fight,

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.125
and they didn't wanna
come here together.

00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:52.375
Even friends fight sometimes!

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:53.333
I don't like it!

00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:54.709
Where is Kumao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:56.750
Kumao- <i>kun</i> 's the cool one!

00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:59.875
Couldn't Usao- <i>kun</i> have
gone away instead?

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.166
[USAHARA]
I'm done!

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.709
It's bad enough that women like
Kumatani better, but kids, too?

00:20:13.792 --> 00:20:15.291
What if you took stock
of your failings

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:17.291
and tried to improve yourself?

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:19.041
[USAHARA] My suck aura's
already strong enough

00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:20.667
to see through a mascot suit.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.583
Game over, bro!

00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:24.625
Yeah, that's fair.

00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:26.458
Whatever. Put it on.

00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:31.250
[USAHARA]
Huh? You mean put on Kumao?

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:33.583
[URAMICHI] It's what the
kids want, isn't it?

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.583
[USAHARA] You really enjoy
watching me suffer,

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:39.250
don't you, Uramichi?

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:42.208
I'm not sure why you would
say that like it's news.

00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:44.125
[USAHARA]
Yeah, me neither.

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:48.500
If I try my best to play Kumao,
will people respect me?

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:49.333
[URAMICHI]
I won't.

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.250
[USAHARA]
Didn't think so.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.667
[URAMICHI]
Look, everybody!

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.166
Kumao- <i>kun</i> came out
to play with you, too!

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.083
[GIRL C]
Yay! Kumao- <i>kun</i> !

00:20:57.166 --> 00:20:58.417
[BOY D]
He's here!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.000
Settle down, you guys,

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:03.041
'cause now it's time
for some ABC Exercise!

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:04.375
You ready?

00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:06.583
Hold on.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.750
Kumao- <i>kun</i> , is that you?

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:15.709
[GIRL D]
Has he... gotten taller?

00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:18.250
[GIRL E]
Yeah. And the way he moves...

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:21.041
It's more annoying somehow.

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:23.333
[KIDS]
Who're you?

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:29.500
[USAHARA screaming]

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:31.125
[USAHARA]
I can't do it!

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.375
They clocked me before
I could even speak!

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.959
Damn. You can even make kids
hate you in a bear suit.

00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:37.208
[USAHARA]
I'm a failure!

00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:38.500
In a bear suit.

00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.917
[USAHARA]
Please quit saying that.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.542
Screw it, I'll tell 'em.

00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:44.000
I'll tell 'em
Kumao- <i>kun</i> got sick

00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:46.375
and couldn't make it
to the shoot today.

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.417
[USAHARA]
Hey, everyone!

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.041
I have something
important to say!

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:52.417
[KIDS]
Huh?!

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.417
[GIRL D]
Is that Usao- <i>kun</i> 's head?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.125
[BOY F]
On Kumao- <i>kun</i> 's body?

00:21:56.208 --> 00:21:58.542
[USAHARA]
Hip-- Oh, crap.

00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:01.417
[URAMICHI]
Usao- <i>kun</i> ?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.959
[USAHARA]
Sir!

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:35.458
[USAHARA]
Kumatani.

00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:38.291
I've never told you, um,
how much I need you.

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.875
[KUMATANI]
Huh? Well, that's creepy.

00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:43.750
[USAHARA] I'm just so
grateful to have you around.

00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:44.709
[click]

00:23:44.792 --> 00:23:47.917
[USAHARA]
Huh? Oh. He hung up.
