00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,291
I've decided we shall
name the child Tokaku.

00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,916
[TOKAKU'S MOTHER]
She can't be the Azuma heir.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,750
I don't want her
to become a killer.

5
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,083
She can't be like us.

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,000
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
Tokaku, if you ever think

7
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:46,375
of killing someone again,
just remember this shrine.

8
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,625
What'll that do?

9
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,125
You won't be able to kill
because inside that shrine,

10
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,875
your mother will
be watching you.

11
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,125
Tokaku? What are you...

12
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:04,166
I just-- I don't understand why.

13
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,208
You honestly want to kill me?

14
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,416
This is wrong! This doesn't
make sense, Tokaku!

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Why do you-- Why now?

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,916
[TOKAKU]
Because I couldn't before.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,458
I was incapable of killing.

18
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,416
[TOKAKU] But now, the spell
on me has been broken.

19
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,125

path to follow now.

Or let live and die?

Or have you decided to attempt
to let live and live?

25
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,125
Aw, Tokaku. You've already
figured it out, huh?

discussed, they're the things

I have one question
before you do it.

36
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,708
Are you going to kill me
'cause you think

37
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,750
I betrayed you?
Is that the reason why?

38
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,166
Do you really believe that?

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,416
That I controlled
you with my power?

40
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,958
I don't know. And I need to.

41
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,083
This is the only way
to find out for sure.

42
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,416
The only way that I can
prove it to myself.

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,625
[HARU whimpers]

Wait, Tokaku?

47
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,750
What the hell is
she trying to pull?

48
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,875
C'mon, let's go!

49
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,916
Tokaku, hold on.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,500
What's happening?
How can there be two of you?

51
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,791
[TOKAKU]
Because that's Nio!

52
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,958
Huh?

53
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,000
Try to think back
on what she told you.

54
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,583
About the Azuma
and Kuzunoha clans.

55
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,208
The two most powerful
families of assassins.

56
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,250
[TOKAKU]
The Azumas have long specialized

57
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:26,000
in combat-assassination
techniques. While the Kuzunohas

58
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,875
are well-known
black arts practitioners.

59
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,458
Like black magic?

60
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,166
They say that, but it's just
hypnosis and mind games.

61
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,500
[TOKAKU] They psychologically
manipulate their targets.

62
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,916
Rob them of their ability
to know what's real,

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,291
then drive them to their deaths
or make them kill other people.

64
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,125
So, that other
Tokaku was really Nio?

65
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,541
That's my guess. Think about it.

66
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,125
[TOKAKU] She probably put these
lights and incense down here

67
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,791
because they have
a hypnotic effect.

68
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:00,250
Look around, this place is
like a stage set just for her.

69
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,041
But still,
assuming that was Nio,

70
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,875
why would she try to kill me?

71
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,208
I mean, she's the
arbitrator of Class Black.

72
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,833
[TOKAKU] But she never
said that she wasn't

73
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,583
an assassin, right?

74
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,791
From the very moment
Class Black ended,

75
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,708
her plan was to betray
you and kill you.

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,958
And do it while disguised as me.

77
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,041
It's exactly the type
of scheme a Kuzunoha

78
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,375
would come up with.

79
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
Even here, the clan is still...

80
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,583
Hey, come on...

81
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,958
[HARU] And you're okay
with helping me?

82
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,541
It could still be true.

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,750
I really might have manipulated
you into protecting me.

84
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,541
I don't even know
the truth of it.

85
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,625
I might have...

86
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,916
I might have done
something awful

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,708
and completely
unforgivable to you!

88
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm aware of this.

89
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,625
And maybe it's true.

90
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,208
Maybe you did use your
power to make me help you.

91
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,208
I wish that I could
deny that, but I can't.

[TOKAKU]
But still.

93
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,583
With you, I was able to find
something I'd never had before.

94
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,541
The feelings that led me
to become your friend,

95
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,833
they made me
the person I am now.

I made a vow that
I would protect Haru!

105
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,916
There's nothing that could
make me want to kill her!

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,875
That's where you're wrong!

107

it's the only way to help her.

[HARU gasps]

Well I've gotta be honest...

I really thought that you
were a more logical person.

111
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,416
This is the most
logical means.

112
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,125
Killing her is the only
way to prove anything.

[HARU gasps]

114
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,000
This is the only way
I can find out for sure.

--Prove what?
--The truth!

116
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,791
Haru doesn't even
know what she is!

117
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,375
Which is why she questions
whether or not all this happened

118
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,583
just because of the Primer!

119
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,625
[TOKAKU]
You heard her.

120
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,375
She said the Primer
can exert itself

121
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,166
without you even being
conscious of it.

122
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,083
And it only gets stronger
the more danger you're in.

123
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,041
So...

124
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,541
All of this time protecting her,

125
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,583
and that's why you
wanna kill her?

126
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,291
Killing her and protecting
her are one in the same.

127
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,500
Heh.

128
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,375
[TOKAKU] I have the
ability to kill Haru!

129
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,791
I always have!

130
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,958
It doesn't matter how
much she wishes to live!

131
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,125
Or how much she
exerts her Primer!

132
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,916
But living is her greatest
wish, and you'd kill it?

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,666
If I have to. Her wishes
can't control me!
