Death is not the end
of a person's life,

There are still over 24

Thanks! There's no way
I could have done it

316
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,208
without your help though.

317
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,625
Of course they end up with
the best grades in the class.

318
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,125
It's always the ones
who are convinced

319
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,500
they completely failed.

320
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,833
Yeah, talk about obnoxious.

321
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,250
Drumroll please.

322
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,666
The highest score of
the midterms goes to:

323
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,666
Haru Ichinose!

324
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,833
[HARU]
Seriously? So that means...

325
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,375
I'm at the top of the class now?

326
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,291
[SHIENA]
Wow. Good job.

327
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,208
[MAHIRU]
Really. That's great.

328
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,583
[HARUKI] I'm not surprised.
Girl worked pretty hard.

329
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,083
[MIZOROGI]
Okay, ladies, settle down.

330
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,875
It's time to start class.

331
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,500
[MIZOROGI] I hope you do just as
well at your next school, Kouko.

332
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,125
It's too bad about Kouko.

333
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,750
I guess she just
wasn't really suited

334
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,916
for Class Black after all.

335
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,333
Is that...

336
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,958
It's the checkout card.

337
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,541
Maybe it'll help
Kaminaga find happiness.

338
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,041
[TOKAKU]
I don't see how it'll work.

339
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,291
She didn't write her name on it.

340
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,666
[HARU] It'll work.
The most important thing

341
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,500
about magic charms
is to believe in them!

342
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,083
[TOKAKU]
Is that right?

343
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,291
Yep!

344
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,041
[TOKAKU sighs]

345
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:57,041
[KAIBA] Baby pink, milky pink,
smoky pink, light pink.

346
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,375
They all look like the
same damn color to me.

347
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,583
Women make things
so complicated.

348
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,541
Not to name names, but if you
wipe your hands on your skirt

349
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,333
instead of a handkerchief,
you're a bit of skank.
