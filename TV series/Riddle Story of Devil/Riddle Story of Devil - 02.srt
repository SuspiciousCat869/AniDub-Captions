[TOKAKU gasps]

3
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,083
[KAIBA] It's seriously
starting to get exhausting

4
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,041
dealing with such a child.

5
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,833
[KAIBA] Like hell there's
one correct answer

6
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,166
to such an ambiguous question.

7
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,083
The only right answer
would have to come from

8
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,208
the mouth of another.

9
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,958
An answer that you
would clearly never

10
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,375
come up with on your own.

11
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,375
Tokaku, have you
finally opened up

12
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,500
and let someone into your life?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,166
[KAIBA] It's about time
you woke up, girl.

You can't sleep forever.

How much longer can it possibly
take for you to realize

that everything
I tell you is a lie?

[STUDENT 2A]
Oh, check this.

00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,208
There's apparently some
mysterious Class Black now.

[STUDENT 2B]
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

20
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,541
It's like a group of
super rich genius students

who transferred in.

22

[STUDENT 2C] Really? I heard
it was a secret class

full of nothing but
famous pop stars.

Well good morning, everybody!
Let's get the day going.

This is gonna be so much fun.

Suzu Shuto. I'm Number 7.

And I'm a big fan
of physical activity.

33
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,625
I'm Kouko Kaminaga.
My student number is 3.

34
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,000
As of today I'll be

Well everything. Naturally.

38
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,958
For example, I'll represent
all of Class Black.

39
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,916
Would any of you care
to dispute the title?

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,375
Nope. You can go ahead
and take dorm rep too.

We're off to a good start!

Now let's keep getting along!

43

[INSTRUCTOR 2A] When rolling
a regular hexahedron die,

44
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,208
which is called a trial,
the possible event resulting

45
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,833
from that roll is one of
six values, one through six.

46
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,000
Giving us a total
of six outcomes.

47
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,875
Looking at the
ratio of how often

48
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,375
each of these events occurs...

acting like normal students.

and get this over with?

It's not like I give a
damn about the reward.

about Kaiba's assessment.

Oh. Hey, Miss Tokaku.

So I found this spot
yesterday while wandering

98
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,583
around campus and made
a note to remember it

99
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,333
'cuz it had such a lovely view.

100
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,083
You're welcome to
have one of these.

101

Nio recommended them to me.

102
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,833
They're mini melon buns,

up quickly, didn't it?

I hope I got enough of these
to pass out to everyone.

ya don't wanna wait

tonight, Mistress Isuke?

of this and get home ASAP.

out of being impatient, y'know.

[ISUKE]
And how many times you think

116
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,666
the early bird heard that one?

117
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,125
I'll be heading out
to get that worm now.

119
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,333
[HARU] Yeah. She said she's
got some exotic tea blend.

120
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,791
Why don't you join us
if you're not too busy.

121
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,666
Is she coming over
here to our room?

122
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,500
Yeah, I'm sorry for not
checking with you first.

123
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,958
But you weren't here
so I kinda said yes.

124
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,500
I'll just go out for a while.

125
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,333
Okay, but it'd be really nice
if we could all be friends.

126
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,625
She's not my friend
and this is your room.

127
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,958
You can do whatever you want.

128
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,916
That's not true. This room
belongs to both of us.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's just as much yours as mine.

Hello, Isuke!

00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,291
Oh, Miss Azuma.
Aren't you staying?

133
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,708
You've got a rancid stench.

[HARU]
Miss Tokaku!

135
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,500
[ISUKE]
Ooh. Think she's jealous?

136
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:20,708
[TOKAKU panting, grunting]

137
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,500
So, um. Why'd your parents
decide to name you Isuke?

138
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,916
Not to pry, but it is
a guy's name, right?

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,833
It's a boring story.
Your tea's getting cold.

140
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,833
Oh, sorry about that.

141
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,416
It has a nice fragrance.

142
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,416
Something wrong?

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,333
No, it's delicious.

144
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,833
[ISUKE]
So you asked about my name.

145
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,541
It's a variant of my mom's.

146
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,250
It's a pretty cool one,
don't you think?

147
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,125
[HARU] It is! But now I'm
stuck trying to figure out

148
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,458
what your mom's name
might be, like, Isuko?

149
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,458
[ISUKE]
It's Eisuke.

150
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,708
Huh?

151
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,916
Now you're wondering why
she's got a man's name.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,250
Well that's because
my mom is a man.

153
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,833
And my dad's a
man too, of course.

154
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,916
Oh. Huh.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,291
Full disclosure here,
I don't actually share a single

156
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,500
drop of blood with
either of my parents.

157
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,916
And if I don't need any of their
blood to be related to them,

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,333
then I don't need to spill any
of yours in order to kill you.

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,666
[HARUKI]

160
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,333
[HARUKI] I heard your
room was supposed to be

161
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,791
having a little tea party.

162
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,333
[TOKAKU]
Wasn't my idea.

163
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,541
[HARUKI] So you just left Haru
and Isuke all by themselves?

164
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,333
I wonder if Class Black's
gonna be ending early then.

165
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,541
What does that mean?

166
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,166
[HARUKI]
What, didn't Nio tell you?

167
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,708
Starting tonight,
Class Black's being activated.

168
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,583
Isuke is impatient.

169
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,750
She's convinced your
roomie must be the target.

170
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,041
[TOKAKU gasps]

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,333
[HARUKI]
Uh, bye.

172
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,916
[NIO]
Well, you're more of a schemer

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,833
than I gave you credit for.

174
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,708
The last thing you want is
Isuke beating you to the punch,

175
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,250
but you also know it wouldn't
be wise to have bad blood

176
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,083
between you and you roommate.

177
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,708
It might be too
late for all I know.

178
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,333
[NIO] Oh, don't go
doubting your plan now.

179
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,875
Haru Ichinose.

180
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,750
She's got quite the body
count under her belt.

181
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,416
All of her siblings, plus her
very own mother and father...

182
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,958
She went after her own
family? I doubt that.

183
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,375
[NIO] But she so did!
Took 'em out in cold blood.

184
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,000
She's a nasty piece of work.
Hey, wait, you've got a lot

185
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,750
of brothers and sisters
too, don't you?

186
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
[NIO yells]

187
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,625
[HARUKI] Leave my family
out of this, dammit.

188
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
[NIO]
Sure, roger that!

189
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,625
[ISUKE] Now, I just soak her
in the tub. And that's that.

190
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,083
You can try, but Haru won't die.

191
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,208
Huh?

192
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,416
[HARU]
Haru has an incantation on her.

193
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,041
A spell. It prevents
her from ever dying.

194
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,666
[ISUKE] Hm. Must be
talking in her sleep.

195
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,333
[KAIBA] C'mon, Tokaku.
How much longer can you sleep?

196
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:33,666
That beast clawing away inside
you can't hibernate forever.

197
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,375
Your keen sense
of smell comes from

198
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,791
that feral nature after all.

199
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,791
[TOKAKU gasps]

200
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,041
[ISUKE] Just barge
right in, why don't you?

201
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,416
[TOKAKU gasps]

202
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,541
[ISUKE] I know, I couldn't
believe it either!

203
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,666
The scars on this
girl are incredible.

204
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,666
It's really kinda hot.

205
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,041
[TOKAKU] She didn't want
anyone to see those scars.

206
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,708
Oh don't tell me you're upset.

207
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,916
Once the target's revealed,
its first come, first served!

208
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,375
[TOKAKU]
She's just unconscious.

209
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,250
[TOKAKU]
I should've guessed.

210
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,875
She's not as normal
as she seems.

211
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,333
[inaudible]

212
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,875
[TOKAKU gasps]

213
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,583
[ISUKE]
You're not stealing my kill!

214
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,666
[TOKAKU grunts]

215
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,333
[ISUKE] Why the hell
are you protecting her?

216
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
[ISUKE gasps]

217
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,208
You bitch!

218
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,416
[ISUKE grunts]

219
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,333
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
Tokaku!

220
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
[TOKAKU gasps]

221
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,166
[ISUKE gasps]

222
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,500
[ISUKE grunts]

223
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,625
Holy crap, you're a virgin.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,541
[TOKAKU groans]

225
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,583
You haven't killed
a single person yet.

226
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,083
Have you, virgin?

227
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,708
[ISUKE laughs]

228
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,750
[TOKAKU panting]

229
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,500
Wow...

230
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,208
You sure you're an Azuma?

231
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,416
If that is true, then it
makes this even funnier.

232
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,666
[ISUKE] I'll do you a solid
and keep it quiet.

233
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,125
I'm happy to hold
onto this ammo.

234
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,375
No...

235
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,875
Wait...

236
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,583
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
Hurry, Tokaku!

237
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,291
This way! There's no time!

238
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,916
If you ever think of
killing someone again,

239
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,125
just remember this shrine.

240
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,708
[YOUNG TOKAKU]
What'll that do?

241
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,458
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
You won't be able to kill.

242
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,833
Because inside that shrine...

243
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,833
[inaudible]

244
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,208
...will be watching you.

245
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,625
[TOKAKU] It's a curse.
It's still with me.

246
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,250
Ow!

247
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,666
Why were you leaning over me?

248
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,041
What do you think you're doing?

249
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,416
[HARU]
Jeez, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,750
You were just
sweating really badly.

251
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,791
I just head-butted you
and you hardly even blinked!

252
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,666
And I don't understand
how you can be conscious

253
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,000
after being drugged!

254
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,333
Where did you get
all those scars?

255
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,708
I wanna know who
the hell you are!

256
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,250
[HARU]
Miss Tokaku.

257
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,041
You're not the only one
with questions, you know?

258
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,375
For example.

259
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
Why didn't you just
let her kill me?

260
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,166
[TOKAKU gasps]

261
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,958
I've got a strong
resistance to chemicals,

262
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
so drugs don't work on me.

263
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,500
I was actually awake
most of the time there.

264
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,833
The students in our class,
they transferred here

265
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,500
to assassinate me, didn't they?

266
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,500
[TOKAKU]
Wait, you knew about that?

267
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,000
[HARU] So why'd you
really come to my rescue?

268
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,125
Was it a whim or a strategy?

269
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,541
Or maybe...

270
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,125
some other reason...

271
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,791
I promise you, I won't die.
No matter what happens.

272
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,958
Believe me.

273
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,000
They won't succeed
and I'm gonna graduate.

274
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,583
There's no way.
You're just too ordinary.

275
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,416
Not exactly.
You see, my family...

276
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,375
They were all a part
of a very large

277
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,500
and very powerful organization.

278
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,083
And there are a lot
of people out there

279
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,291
that want me dead just
for being related to them.

280
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,708
And my entire immediate family.

281
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,958
All of them died, for me.

282
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,083
My father... My mother...

283
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,791
Both of my brothers.

284
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,083
My grandpa...

285
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,458
Everyone.

286
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,666
So I can't say my life just
belongs to me anymore.

287
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,291
They sacrificed
themselves to protect me.

288
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,250
And the worst part is.

289
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,708
My mom...

290
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,875
I didn't even get the chance
to say goodbye to her.

291
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,208
Mother.

292
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,750
[HARU]
But she's always with me.

293
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,250
She's right here, telling me
what's right and what's wrong.

294
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,958
[TOKAKU]
It's a curse.

295
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,541
[HARU] Everyone in
my family always said

296
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,666
they loved to see me smiling.

297
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,750
So you'll never see me cry.

298
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,083
[TOKAKU]
It's a damn curse.

299
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:14,250
Basically, I feel like I was
put on this earth to smile.

300
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,625
[TOKAKU]
We're stuck.

301
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,375
Living beneath the suffocating
demands of the dead.

302
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,625
[YOUNG HARU sobbing]

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,458
[HARU]
So this is my final test.

304
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,583
And I will pass, just watch.

305
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,583
I am going to
survive Class Black.

306
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,791
[TOKAKU]
Impossible.

307
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,583
[HARU] And then I'll
make them proud of me.

308
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,083
I'll make sure they know none
of their deaths were in vain.

309
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,208
[TOKAKU]
Impossible!

310
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,708
You're up against
12 trained killers.

311
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,041
How can you survive?

312
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,708
[HARU] There have been a lot
more than 12 people

313
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,750
that died to keep me alive!

314
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,708
[TOKAKU] You do realize that I'm
after your life as well, right?

315
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,458
[HARU]
Yes, I'm aware of that.

316
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,208
[TOKAKU]
Aren't you afraid?

317
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:01,166
Why don't you run?
I mean, why stay?

318
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,708
The way I see it.

319
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,583
After what I've been through,
I know I wasn't born to die.

320
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,541
I was born to live
no matter what.

321
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,750
[TOKAKU gasps]

322
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,333
[TOKAKU] You're covered in
scars, and you know everyone

323
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,583
is out to kill you, so how
can you look at the world

324
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,375
with eyes like that?

325
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,958
Okay, I answered you.

326
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,541
It's your turn to answer me.

327
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,541
[HARU] Why did you risk your
life in order to protect mine?

328
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,125
[TOKAKU]
Uh...

329
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,916
Well I guess...

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,333
I guess I saved you because...

331
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,708
[knocking]

332
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
For you.

333
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,208
[NIO]
Welcome, esteemed assassins,

334
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,625
to the prestigious
Myojo Private School.

335
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,333
As you know, I'm Nio Hashiri,
the arbitrator of Class Black.

336
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,291
We're now set to
start orientation.

337
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,083
But before we do...

338
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,083
[SUMIREKO]
Hello, I'm student number 11.

339
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,375
Sumireko Hanabusa.

340
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,875
I have somewhat of
a frail constitution,

341
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,333
so I'm only comfortable
in my own furniture.

342
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,791
[NIO]
Hm. Whatever, sister.

343
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,958
As for the rest of you,
you've kept your word

344
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,833
and maintained your
patience while awaiting

345
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,583
everyone's arrival, and we're
genuinely pleased and grateful

346
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
for your composure.

347
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,041
Now from this point forward,

348
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,166
we ask that you strictly
adhere to the rules.

349
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,833
[NIO]
So... Will someone in this group

350
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,625
successfully eliminate
Haru Ichinose?

351
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,666
Or will Haru
survive your attempts

352
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,208
and safely graduate
from Class Black?

353
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,416
I know each of you has
already been fully debriefed.

354
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,958
But let's review the
rules one more time.

355
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,333
Do they seriously mean
anything we want?

356
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,166
[NIO]
They are completely serious!

357
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,041
The board of the
Myojo Private School will grant

358
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,875
any single wish
you can think of,

359
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,333
but only one of you can succeed.

360
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,500
So in other words, don't get
Teacher Man mixed up in this.

361
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,125
[NIO]
Precisely.

362
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,916
Mr. Mizorogi doesn't
know anything about this.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,541
He's nothing more than
an honest, ordinary guy.

364
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,375
[SHINYA] Doesn't say
anything about not tangling

365
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,833
with other Class Black students.

366
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,750
[NIO] This is the
advanced kill notice.

367
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,708
You'll use this as the
declaration that you're

368
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,333
making your move on Haru.

369
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,833
You each get to use one
notice, and only one notice.

370
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,791
Once you send it out,
there will be no cancelling.

371
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,625
And I advise you to be very
careful with your timing.

372
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,208
After delivering your
advanced notice to Haru,

373
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,291
you'll have 48 hours
to kill her. If you don't,

374
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,750
you fail the mission, and you
will be immediately expelled.

375
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,708
Submit the notice at any time.

376
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,750
Overlapping with
other people is allowed.

377
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,750
Go ahead and be selfish!

378
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,416
[NIO laughs] Oh, no, Miss
Tokaku, you're a little late.

379
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,916
Here's your advance kill notice.

380
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,166
[NIO gasps]

381
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,958
If any of you try to kill her,

382
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,333
you'll have to go
through me first.

383
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,791
[TOKAKU] They got their
numbers all wrong.

384
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,625
There aren't 12
assassins, but 11.

385
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,083
And one protector.

386
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,125
So you wanna know
the reason I saved you?

387
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,875
That's easy.

388
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,458
It's because I'm
defecting to your side.

389
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,208
[TOKAKU]
And today, it truly began.

390
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:23,041
[TOKAKU]
All of it. For me and Haru.

391
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,125
[KAIBA]
Hello, I'm Mr. Kaiba,

392
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,750
an instructor at
Private Academy 17.

393
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,625
Now that was a plain
and coherent introduction,

394
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:00,875
wouldn't you say?

395
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,708
So, Tokaku. How would
you describe yourself?

396
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,416
I'm sure other people
could answer that

397
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,000
more accurately for you...
