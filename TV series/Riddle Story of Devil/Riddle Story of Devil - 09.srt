[TOKAKU'S GRANDMOTHER]
It means "an impossible thing".

Fitting, don't you think?

00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,666
Those who bear witness
to this child's strength

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,708
will be astounded. Her mere
existence will inspire dread.

00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,708
There couldn't be
a more perfect name

for the heir to
the Azuma family.

Little Tokaku.
You're destined to grow

I don't want her to become

There's no time!

Tokaku. If you ever think
of killing someone again,

You won't be able to kill,

[SHINYA]
How many times I gotta tell ya?

166
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,041
There's nowhere to run!

[HARU gasps]

168

Huh?

[HARU gasps]

171
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,083
I'm impressed you've
stayed alive this long.

172
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,875
I'll reward you by putting
you down with a single blow.

173
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,500
But I still won't die.

174
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,208
I promised Miss Tokaku that
I'd graduate no matter what!

175
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,916
Wake up, man.
Azuma's already dead.

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,958
Miss Tokaku won't die either!

177
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,416
She'd never die
in a game like this!

178
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,541
Your time's up.

[HARU gasps]

185

You do understand
what this means, right?

186
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,250
The fact that I'm here?
Tokaku Azuma is totally dead.

[YOUNG TOKAKU]
Where are you taking me?

190
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,541
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
We're leaving this village.

191
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,208
Getting away from this
legacy of murder,

192
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,750
to the world of
broad daylight!

193
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,833
The world of broad daylight?
What does that mean?

194
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
It should never
have taken me so long

195
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,000
to get you out of here.

196
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,791
It's what my sister
wanted me to do.

197
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,208
But I was too damn weak
to make up my mind!

198
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,458
My mom wanted this?

199
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,833
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
It's all my fault.

200
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,375
I was her sister and I ran
from the Azuma legacy.

201
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,833
She had to bear
the burden on her own.

202
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,458
She had no choice but to fight!

203
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,791
Care to tell me
where you're going?

204

[BOTH gasp]

205

[YOUNG TOKAKU gasps]

209
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,916
Forget it all. You have to.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
None of this is your fault.

211
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,250
[YOUNG TOKAKU]
Auntie...

212
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,875
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
Even if you don't remember us.

213
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,500
Your mom and I
will always be there.

214
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,958
We'll always look out for you.

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,375
[TOKAKU'S AUNT]
Watching from the shrine.

216
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,958
It's been you all this time.

217
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,750
You've been the one
calling out to me.

218
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,333
[TOKAKU]
You've been protecting me.

219
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,708
Thank you. But it's okay.

220
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll be alright.

221
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,916
Tokaku...

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,291
[TOKAKU] I have someone
of my own to protect.

223
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,583
So from now on,
I'll make my own decisions.

224
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:03,625
I'll join you someday.
So please wait there for me.

225
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,625
Goodbye, Mother...

[HARU whimpering]

232
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,041
[ISUKE]
Alright, c'mon now.

233
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,291
You've gotta try harder
than this to get away.

234
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,375
Unless you want me to kill you.

235
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,750
[HARU whimpers]

236
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,291
Jeez. What's up with you?
Don't tell me a few cuts

237
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,250
is all it takes
to quash that positivity.

238
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,458
I guess your guardian
angel "Miss Tokaku's"

239
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,708
early death really
took a toll on you, huh?

240
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
[ISUKE] Hey. Would it
make you feel better

241
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,833
if I killed you the same
way I killed her?

242
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,500
Spoiler alert. I tossed her out
a window and she went splat.

243
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,583
Way too easy, right?

244
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,791
It's her own fault for
being such an idiot.

245
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,583
She never even
would've had to die

246
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,375
if she hadn't bothered
protecting you.

247

[ISUKE laughs]

[HARU whimpering]

249
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,333
I think it's time
to complete this job.

[ISUKE grunts]

You almost made it,
Isuke. But you lose.

00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,833
[ISUKE gasps]

256
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,083
Then kill me! Go on and try.

257
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,208
But we both know
you can't do it.

258
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,666
Wrong. I can kill now.

259
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
[TOKAKU] But. That doesn't
mean I'm going to.

260
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:52,291
[ISUKE whimpering]

261

[TOKAKU pants]
Are you okay?

262
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,541
[HARU sobs]
Tokaku!

263
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,125
[HARU] Tokaku! Tokaku!
[TOKAKU] Haru...

264
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,083
[HARU]
I thought they killed you!

265
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,000
That you died because of me,
and I'd never see you again!

266
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,583
[HARU sobbing]

[HARU sobbing] Tokaku...

[HARU sobbing]

269
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,708
[HARU]
The rain stopped...

270
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,708
[TOKAKU] Yeah, we must be right
in the eye of the typhoon.

271
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,875
It wasn't a curse.

272
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,375
Huh?

273
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,291
For most of my life now.

274
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,750
I've felt like
I was suffocating,

275
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,333
trapped beneath the
wishes of the dead.

276
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:50,375
Like it was a burden preventing
me from living my own life.

277
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,416
[TOKAKU]
But I realized I was wrong.

278
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,625
All this time, I was
actually being protected.

279
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,958
[HARU gasps]

280
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,291
Haru. It's thanks
to you I realized that.

281
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,875
I wouldn't have without you.

282
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,458
[HARU] No matter what,
it's good to be alive.

283
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,375
[TOKAKU]
Yeah.

284
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,458
[SUMIREKO] You've all been very
courageous in your efforts.

285
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,375
It may seem the opposite
to the rest of the world,

286
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,375
but the truth is quite apparent
to me and I commend you.

287
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,791
Leave the rest to me
and sleep well.

288
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,916
You deserve the respite.

289
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:59,583
[NIO humming]

[beeps]

292
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,333
[NIO]
Are you serious?

293
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,750
Both Shinya and Isuke
have been eliminated?

294
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,333
That happened a lot
faster than expected.

295
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,791
We're finally down
to the last one.

296
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,791
Well this is
pretty damn exciting.

297
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,833
Oh, little Azuma of the East.

298
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,000
[KAIBA] Looks like there's
a tea party coming up.

299
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,458
The host is pretty high-society,
so I bet it'll be grand.

300
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,416
There's even a
formal dress code.

301
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,541
The finest tea and
every luxury imaginable.

302
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,875
Why don't you at least try
to enjoy yourself, Tokaku?
