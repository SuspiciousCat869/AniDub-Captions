1
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,458
[NIO] Looks like even the
unflappable Mr. Mizorogi

2
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:36,166
is finally starting
to get demoralized.

3
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,166
[TOKAKU]
Just one more person left.

4
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,625
Tch!

5
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,416
[HARU gasps]

6
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,041
[SUMIREKO]
Miss Ichinose, this is for you.

7
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,458
Ooh. That an advanced notice?

8
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,500
[SUMIREKO giggles]

9
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,708
[HARU gasps]

10
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,791
Hm?

11
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,291
[SUMIREKO]
Please rest easy.

12
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,541
This is not an advanced notice.

13
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:22,125
Just an ordinary invitation
to a tea party tonight.

14
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,000
A tea party?

15
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:59,166
[alarm blaring]

16
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,416
[PRISON GUARD 10A]
I lost sight of her!

17
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,958
[PRISON GUARD 10B]
Be careful! She's armed!

18
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,583
[OTOYA]
I won't be long, Harucchi.

19
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,333
[SUMIREKO] The absolute
highest quality Dimbula

20
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:18,000
and orange peel,
lemongrass, hibiscus...

21
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,208
Some heather flower...

22
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,000
And because
tonight is special,

23
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,500
let us add a dash of
fragrant rose hip as well.

24
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,833
[HARU sighs]

25
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,375
[HARU]
Maybe if I talk to her,

26
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,000
and I mean really talk
to her at this tea party,

27
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,541
do you think that she might
give up on killing me?

28
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,000
Why? Do you think
you can negotiate

29
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,625
some kind of truce with her?

30
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,958
[HARU] Maybe I won't
even have to bring it up.

31
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,875
You never know, that could
be the whole reason

32
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,041
Sumireko invited me
in the first place, right?

33
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,416
[TOKAKU]
Don't be stupid!

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,916
This isn't just a tea party.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,375
She's the last assassin left.
Do not drop your guard.

36
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,041
Right, I'm sorry...

37
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,833
t's okay. First, we'll
try talking to her.

38
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,541
And if that fails, I promise
that I'll keep you safe.

39
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,125
Hey. Thank you.

40
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,833
[CHAIRPERSON giggles]

41
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,583
[MIZOROGI]
Pardon me. Madam Chairperson.

42
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,375
Are you in right now?

43
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,375
Madam, there's something

44
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,708
I need to discuss with you.
Do you have a quick moment?

45
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,458
[CHAIRPERSON]
Why, of course. Please, come in.

46
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,000
[MIZOROGI]
Thank you.

47
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,500
[MIZOROGI sighs]
Hello, Madam?

48
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,833
[CHAIRPERSON]
Well, let's hear it.

49
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,791
Feel free to speak your mind.

50
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,333
Uh. Yes ma'am.

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,250
You see, this is
about Class Black.

52
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,000
It's down to just four students.

53
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,750
Is this all my fault?

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,583
Is it because of my incompetence
that they all transferred away,

55
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,625
one after the other?

56
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,833
Calm down.

57
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,750
It's not your fault
in the slightest bit.

58
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,666
You're an exceptional teacher.

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,750
In fact, you are
the perfect teacher.

60
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,208
[CHAIRPERSON] You must simply
believe in yourself more.

61
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,125
Only you could have been
entrusted with something

62
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
as demanding and
precious as Class Black.

63
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,250
[MIZOROGI gasps]
You think so?

64
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,333
[TOKAKU] She actually sent
you a dress to wear, too?

65
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,750
That snobby brat.
What the hell is she plotting?

66
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,416
A dress code. That's normal
for a fancy party. Right?

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,666
Wait, hold on!

68
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,833
I should check to make
sure it's safe, first.

69
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,625
[SUMIREKO] My, my, if it isn't
the long lost Miss Takechi.

70
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,791
[OTOYA gasps]

71
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,291
[SUMIREKO]
You can't be serious.

72
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,833
To be such a sore loser
is disgraceful.

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,875
[OTOYA]
Shut up!

74
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm gonna be the one
who kills Haru!

75
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,625
[OTOYA yells]

76
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,833
[OTOYA gasps]

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,708
Although, you have gone to
a lot of trouble to get here.

78
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,791
It's only right that
I should invite you

79
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,083
to my tea party tonight.

80
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,166
[SUMIREKO giggles]

81
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,208
Seems kind of weird, huh?

82
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:41,000
Letting her hold a tea party
on the top floor?

83
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,000
[TOKAKU gasps] Have you ever
been invited to this kind of

84
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,000
fancy party before?

85
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,458
No, this is a first for me.
And what about you?

86
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,666
This is a first
for me too, so...

87
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,041
Wow!

88
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,083
What? What is this place?

89
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,416
[HARU]
It's amazing!

90
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,250
To think there's a room
like this at our school!

91
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,000
[SUMIREKO]
It was built for this very day.

92
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,375
The Hanabusa Conglomerate
made a contribution

93
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,416
to Myojo Private School,
and received a portion

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,958
of the top floor,
which they then renovated.

95
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,666
[HARU]
Sumireko...

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,083
Good evening.

97
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,958
I'm glad you made it.
I've waited so long for this.

98
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,875
I see Miss Azuma
decided to tag along.

99
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,833
Damn straight. I came
here to keep her safe.

100
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,833
It's just that
you weren't invited.

101
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,791
How appallingly
ill-mannered of you.

102
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,541
I'm not going to your party,
unless Tokaku comes too.

103
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
I suppose I have no choice.

104
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,625
Well then. Both of you
follow me please.

105
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,791
[SUMIREKO] This is the hall
where our party shall be held.

106
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,458
Everyone else has
already arrived you see.

107
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,250
[HARU gasps]

108
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,958
[HARU]
Our class!

109
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,250
[SUMIREKO] The only classmate
who couldn't make it

110
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,666
is Miss Hashiri.

111
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,416
And I took such pains
to invite her.

112
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,666
[OTOYA muffled grunting]

113
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,958
[TOKAKU gasps]

114
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,333
[SUMIREKO]
As we discussed earlier,

115
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,541
my family's Conglomerate
was given full use

116
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,125
of this room by the School.

117
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,250
The floor is entirely
ours tonight.

118
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,583
So, if we wanted, we could
raise quite the commotion

119
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,583
and never be disturbed.

120
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,708
Please, the hateful looks.

121
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,916
I can assure you there's
no need for any animosity.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,333
Come, let's make our way
to our seats, shall we?

123
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
I have prepared
the highest quality

124
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,500
Hanabusa blend and teacakes.

125
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,875
[HARU gasps]
They're puppets?

126
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,750
[TOKAKU gasps]

127
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,791
[HARUKI]
My, this is delicious.

128
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,750
Oh, yes it is.
So richly fragrant.

129
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,541
[PUPPETS murmuring]

130
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,416
And the cups are fabulous.

131
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,791
[KOUKO]
Yes they are....

132
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,875
[SHIENA] ...teacakes
practically melt in your mouth.

133
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,541
[ISUKE] They're everything
the queen's teacakes should be.

134
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,750
[CHITARU HITSUGI]
It is everything it should be.

135
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
[SUMIREKO] And now,
I shall present a riddle.

136
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,708
Perhaps Miss Azuma
would care to entertain us

137
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,208
by attempting to solve it?

138
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,916
What do the worker bee
and the rabbit

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,791
have in common with each other?

140
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,750
[HARU gasps]

141
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,583
What is that supposed to mean?

142
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,541
Well, thinking about
that is precisely

143
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,625
what makes it a riddle. Right?

144
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
Miss Ichinose?

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,250
Miss Hanabusa, I'd like
to speak with you.

146
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,708
Really? About what?

147
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,083
Let's put an end to it.

148
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm sick and tired
of Class Black.

149
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,166
[TOKAKU gasps]

150
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,541
You see, we can stop
this needless bloodshed.

151
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,416
What reward do you want,
Miss Hanabusa?

152
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,458
If at all possible,
I'll gladly give it to you.

153
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,416
Oh will you?

154
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,458
The reality is that
the reward is something

155
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,458
that only you can grant me.

156
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,791
The clans the two of us
come from are really

157
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,583
one and the same, you see.

158
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,166
I think if this were
all simply a riddle,

159
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,708
we might just be the giant
hornet and the joro spider.

160
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,833
[giggles]
You have rather keen eyes.

161
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,291
The eyes of a true queen
who's been to hell and back.

162
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,250
And I understand.

163
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,791
You see, I've been targeted
since I was young as well.

164
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,416
I came close to death
many times in fact.

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,666
I suppose the both of us should
be commended for surviving.

166

[HARU grunts]

167
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,500
[SUMIREKO] But, only one
of us can be the queen.

168
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,500
And it's not you.

169
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,541
When I murder you, everyone will
acknowledge at long last

170
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:44,041
that I am supremely powerful.
And that is what I truly desire.

[BOTH gasp]

172

I'm just putting all my cards
on the table so to speak.

173
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,750
There's honestly no reason
to be so anxious.

174
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,000
[SUMIREKO] I have readied
all manner of weapons for us.

175
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:12,125
Let's begin. Allow me
to make the first move.

176
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,333
Haru. Just stay there!

177
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,791
[NIO] Well, it looks like
the final battle has begun.

178
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,333
Everyone, I'm sorry I gave
the class study hall tonight.

179
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,666
I've brought the latest edition
of the class newsletter

180
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,708
for you guys. Starting
tomorrow, I'd like to--

181
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,958
Oh...

182
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,333
You just stay there

183
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,250
and keep my other
guests company.

00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,083
[SUMIREKO]
You've left me no other choice.

193
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,000
I had intended to
keep you out of this,

194
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,458
so I could defeat Miss Ichinose
without distraction.

195
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,791
I refuse to let that happen.

196
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,083
So sorry. You stay put.

197
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:03,583
We shall continue our duel once
I'm finished with Miss Azuma.

198
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,375
Don't expect me to hold back.

[TOKAKU grunts]

200

Tokaku!

205
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,625
That wall is custom-made
with a practically

206
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,208
indestructible form
of bullet-proof glass.

207
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,375
Even if this entire
building came down,

208
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,375
that wall would still
be in a single piece.

[TOKAKU gasps]

00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,416
I do hope you're prepared.

213
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,041
I'm going to show
you my true form.

I am invincible.

218
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:34,875
I am the true queen.
The supremely powerful.

219
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,625
And you will see
that as the truth

220
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,291
once I'm done with you!

[OTOYA gasps]

223
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,750
Haruchi's great and all,
but Hanabusa is a goddess.

224
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,208
Those limbs of hers...

225
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,166
I simply have to remove them!

226
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,583

00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,541
You wasted your shot.

232
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,250
Admit defeat while you can...

233
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,833
It's a waste of our time
to fight any more.

234
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,041
[TOKAKU]
No, it's not.

235
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,875
You can't stop me
from protecting her.

236
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
[SUMIREKO]
Foolishness...

237
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,333
Why go to such lengths?

238
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,666
I fight, in order
to protect the things

239
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,166
that are precious to me.
You understand?

240
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,833
That's not complex.

241
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,750
You consider Miss Ichinose
precious to you.

242
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,416
Yeah. And I promised to
protect her no matter what.

243
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,041
Even if it means
that I have to die.

244
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,500
If that's what it takes,
then so be it!

245
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,958
[SUMIREKO laughs]
How sad. You don't even realize

246
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,916
that that's the power
of the queen bee.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,583
[TOKAKU]
The queen bee?

248
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,375
The worker bee and the rabbit?

249
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
What they have in common
is that they're both

250
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,291
willing to give up their
lives to protect the leader.

251
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,041
Yet still, the worker bee
is completely oblivious

252
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,291
to the fact that she
is merely a worker.

253
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,666
What the hell are you saying?

254
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,166
That Haru is some
kind of queen bee?

255
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,416
Hm.

256
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,500
[NIO] Oh damn it, I'm so
totally late for this.

257
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,625
They're really going
at it out there.

258
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,583
What the--? Takechi?

259
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,041
What in the world
are you doing here?

260
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,083
This is a big no-no.

261
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
[OTOYA gasps]

262
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,500
Hanabusa's got this under
control so let's get you

263
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,750
back where you belong.

264
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,416
[SUMIREKO]
If all you do is run away,

265
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,333
you won't be able to defeat me.

266
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,541
At the rate you're going,

267
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,750
you'll never make
a good worker bee.

and running away?

for a brief moment there,

I actually thought you
had the upper hand on me.

Even without any worker bees,
I have survived, thus far,

00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,750
[TOKAKU]
Haru.

322
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,333
Thank you, Haru.

323
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,208
[HARU sobs]
I've done something terrible.

324
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:51,208
[HARU sobbing]

325
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,541
[TOKAKU]
Haru...

326
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,583
What about all those
things Hanabusa said?

327
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,000
The queen bee? What was
she talking about?

328
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,000
[TOKAKU]
Tell me.

329
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry, Tokaku.
But it's not the right time.

330
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,916
I promise that I'll tell you
as soon as I'm able to.

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,958
[TOKAKU gasps]

332
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,250
Well, would you look at that?

333
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,958
I guess she won't be
the queen after all.

334
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,875
[KAIBA] Everyone says they
wanna know the truth,

335
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,750
but have you thought about
what happens after you find it?

336
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,750
You must ask, did you
really wanna know

337
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,416
the truth in the first place?

338
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,000
Then again, you've already
gone and rolled the dice.

339
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,875
Do you have the resolve
to see what you've rolled?
