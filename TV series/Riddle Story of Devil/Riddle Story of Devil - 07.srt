00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,125
[SUZU]
Dawn brings yet another day.

3
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,750
So many.

4
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,041
So many days.

5
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,000
[MIZOROGI]
Well, girls.

6
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,791
I'm pleased to say
that the Annual Festival

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,625
was an incredible success.

8
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,625
And Romeo and Juliet
went over like gangbusters!

9
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,291
You had your teacher crying
like a baby by the end.

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,291
Nevertheless! You may have
noticed more vacant desks

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,958
in the classroom today.

12
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,541
Yes, we've had more
unexpected transfers.

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,000
You can't let that
get you down though.

14
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,750
Believe me, I miss them
as much as anyone.

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,333
But the seven of you gotta
do your best to stay strong!

16
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,166
Poor naïve teacher.
Always cheerful. Unflappably so.

17
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,291
I cannot stand
people that happy.

18
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,041
It makes me feel sick.

19
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,041
Well, who else could work here?

20
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:15,333
I bet they hired him 'cause he's
so super positive, you know?

21
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,375
It's all gonna be
okay, Miss Tokaku.

22
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
We just have to
stay strong, right?

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,291
Like Mr. Mizorogi said.

24
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,458
[ISUKE]
Your blind optimism is pathetic.

25
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,750
I can't stand it. Makes me
wanna smash your face.

26
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,958
[TOKAKU grunts]

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,250
[ISUKE] Ooh, I'm so scared!
[SUZU] Alright,

28
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,541
[SUZU] calm down everybody!
[ISUKE] What?

29
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,125
[ISUKE]
Let's not fight over nothing.

30
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
We're just tense that's all.

31
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,583
I think now's a good time
to take a little breather.

32
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,416
A breather?

33
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,541
[SUZU]
That's right.

34
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,666
I stumbled upon
something wonderful.

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,916
So after class, what do you say
we all go and take a look?

36
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,750
[GIRLS giggling, gasping]

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,916
[ISUKE] That's Myojo
Private School for you.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,166
Even got their own water park!

39
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,791
[NIO] Duh! We've also got an
Olympic sized pool for classes.

40
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,708
[SUZU] I had time reserved
exclusively for Class Black.

41
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,708
After the festival, I think
we've earned a little R and R.

42
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't you?

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,750
And of course,
we have swimsuits too.

44
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,833
Thank you so much!
It's incredible!

45
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,125
C'mon Miss Tokaku,
let's go hurry up and change!

46
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,333
[TOKAKU]
Uh... Hold on!

47
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,291
Well. C'mon, ladies,
what are you waiting for?

48
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,708
A school swimsuit?

49
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,583
[SUMIREKO] Don't tell me they
expect us to wear that swimsuit.

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,041
[ISUKE]
So lame.

51
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,541
They think we're just a bunch
of toddlers, don't they?

52
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,416
If you're not a fan of the
school's designated swimwear,

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,833
well then, we have
more choices for you!

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
Pick whatever you like!

55
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,208
Um, do you intend on
going scuba diving, Nio?

56
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,875
[NIO] No way! I was going
for more of a bondage vibe!

57
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,500
[SUMIREKO]
Okay. I've made my selection.

58
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,958
Honestly. I think I like regular
old swimsuits the best.

59
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,958
What do you think?

60
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,875
Oh, my. Isn't that daring...

61
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,750
Something might even fall out!

62
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,333
She's got nothing there.
So there's nothing to fall out.

63
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,333
This one exposes too much skin.

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,916
It won't do.
It offers no protection.

65
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,625
A normal athletic swimsuit's
the practical choice.

66
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,416
[HARU]
The game?

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,916
[HARU gasps]

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,416
Hey, what are you doing?

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,916
Try to stay calm.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,416
It'll explode if you attempt
to remove it by force.

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,916
It's a bomb?

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,166
[SUZU]
Correct.

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,458
A very small one, yes,
but that's all I need.

74
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,666
If it detonates while it's
strapped around her neck,

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
then she dies instantly.

76
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't rely solely
on my physical strength,

77
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,833
so I intend to win through
this little game of mine.

78
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,208
The bomb is set to go off
at precisely midnight tonight.

79
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,541
If you fail to diffuse
it before then...

80
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,041
Well then, I win.

81
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,291
I'm gonna kill you!

82
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,041
I suppose you could
but you should know

83
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,750
that killing me won't save her.

84
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,291
You see Azuma, there's just
one way to disable the device.

85
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,291
[SUZU] You must enter
the 4 digit passcode.

86
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,875
Simple as that.

87
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,041
I'll even give you three tries
out of the kindness of my heart.

88
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,541
But if you get it
wrong all three times...

89
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,666
Oh my! Bye-bye!

90
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,791
You had better
tell me that passcode!

91
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,208
But figuring it out
yourself is the game. Look.

92
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,916
There are four cards,
each representing one digit

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,875
of the passcode,
hidden here in the park.

94
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,250
Find all four and
you've got the passcode.

95
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,125
To make it fun, included
with the advanced notice

96
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,541
are hints to their whereabouts.

97
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,958
[SUZU giggles] I just love
a good riddle. Don't you?

98
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,750
Well, what do you say we all
go enjoy this game together?

99
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,458
[TOKAKU]
Don't worry, it'll be alright.

100
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,083
We'll find the code and
get that thing off you.

101
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,291
Miss Tokaku...

102
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,625
"One card is in the forest."

103
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,000
[HARU]
Is that it over there?

104
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,291
[TOKAKU] It's the only
forest around I can see.

105
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,916
[HARU]
"One card is in the water."

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,541
I'm guessing that probably
means it's in the pool.

107
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Go ahead and jump
on in if you like.

108
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,500
I wouldn't think of keeping
you from taking a dip.

109
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,541
That collar of yours
is water proof.

110
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,541
So don't you worry, the device
will still detonate under water.

111
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,458
[ISUKE] With all of
the rules they gave us

112
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,958
and the advanced notices,

113
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,083
Class Black was sort of
a game already.

114
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,958
Did she have to go and
literally make it a game?

115
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,416
[NIO] Bloody battle after
bloody battle just gets boring

116
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,458
after a while,
so I think it's super cool

117
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,916
to change it up this way.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,583
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if Class Black's sponsors

119
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,833
actually want Haru dead.

120
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,000
You know something
we don't, don't you?

121
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,416
No... What could
I possibly know?

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,791
Whether or not it's all
some strange test, maybe?

123
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,000
C'mon, I know you can tell me
what the end game is here.

124
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,125
I don't know.

125
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,250
So you just gonna
sit around and talk?

126
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,541
You do realize that
if this kills Haru,

127
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,833
Class Black's game is over.

128
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,166
[SUMIREKO] If it ends like this,
then it wasn't worth playing

129
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,333
to begin with.

130
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,875
I, for one, prefer
a higher caliber sport.

131
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,416
For the moment,
though, let's relax

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,291
and observe from where we are.

133
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,583
Here. Please help
yourself to one of these.

134
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,208
Uh, thank you.

135
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,625
Man, this is nice!

136
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,375
It's almost like
we're at a resort!

137
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,708
Who's up for a game of
split the watermelon?

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,125
Anybody?

139
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,500
I just happen to have a
perfect watermelon right here.

140
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,125
My, how delightful.

141
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,458
Assassins engaging
in party games?

142
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,375
I do hope you'll
allow each one of us

143
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,458
to use our weapon of choice.

144
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,125
[NIO] Uh, just to be clear, do
you wanna do this blindfolded?

145
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,875
Because that sounds
ridiculously dangerous.

146
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,666
[SUMIREKO]
Well, of course blindfolded.

147
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,291
You'll find that it
won't be necessary

148
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,791
to guide me to the melon.

149
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,000
You can trust me on this,
my bullets will naturally

150
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,083
find their target.

151
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,083
[NIO]
Oh, c'mon!

152
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,291
That's not
"split-the-watermelon"!

153
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,166
That's "blast-the-watermelon
to smithereens!

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,250
[HARU]
What is it, Miss Tokaku?

155
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,000
[TOKAKU]
"One card is hidden in the dark

156
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,083
and only voices will
guide you there".

157
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,666
I think I know
where that card is.

158
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,958
[NIO gasps]

159
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,416
Alright, I found one card.

160
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,125
The 7 of diamonds.

161
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,291
Hey, bravo, you found it!

162
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,916
[HARU] That was so amazing!
How did you know?

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,750
[sighs] Were this task mine
alone, I would have already

164
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,375
identified all four cards,
and with much less drama.

165
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you saying you know
where the other cards are too?

166
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,250
But of course.

167
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,041
The solution is
honestly all too easy.

168
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,125
[MAHIRU]
The cards. The remainder.

169
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,083
Mahiru, I take it that you've
figured it out as well?

170
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,708
How brilliant you are.

171
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,833
The remainder? Of what?

172
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,375
Oh. Hot on the trail?

173
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,250
Assuming all four cards used
were drawn from this same deck,

174
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,375
we don't have to find any
of your hiding places.

175
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,875
We just have to see which cards
are missing from the deck

176
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,250
to know the four digits.

177
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,625
Oh, I get it! That's so cool!

178
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,625
[HARU]
Four sevens missing.

179
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,750
So, the passcode
is just four sevens?

180
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,833
You can't be serious,
that's so easy!

181
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,166
That combination
might be the worst

182
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,541
possible passcode in history!

183
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,083
[SUZU giggles]
Okay, so now what will you do?

184
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,625
It's time. Now.

185
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,458
[HARU gasps]

186
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,333
Here goes.

187
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,583
[TOKAKU gasps]

188
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,291
[SUZU]
Oh no, what could've happened?

189
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,500
Oh right, I remember,
I set up that deck

190
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,291
to throw you off track.

191
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,833
And that made you waste
an attempt to boot.

192
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:07,625
You've only got two left now.
You better be careful!

193
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
Damn!

194
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,166
[MIZOROGI] If I want to prevent
any more sudden transfers.

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,125
I've got to take care of
my students any way I can.

196
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,250
No way. These two
have no family.

197
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,375
Maybe if we stay away from
conversations about home life,

198
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,791
they'll feel more comfortable.

199
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,583
[MIZOROGI gasps]
This is...

200
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,208
[TOKAKU]
The sun is setting.

201
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,666
[SHINYA]
And that means...

202
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,250
it's time for me
to come out and play!

203
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,500
[ISUKE]
Show up if you want

204
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,291
but there's really
nothing for you to do.

205
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,208
Not to mention, that swimsuit is
not a fit for your personality.

206
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,791
Just shut your trap already!

207
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,666
Mahiru has always wanted
to swim in a school swimsuit.

208
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,041
Let's go!

209
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,958
[SHINYA laughs]

210
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,125
So she had that prepared
the entire time.

211
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,583
Now that's forward thinking.

212
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,833
[SUZU] Okay ladies,
we still have quite some time

213
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,875
until we reach the
midnight deadline.

214
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,666
You should enjoy
yourselves until then.

215
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,708
[NIO] Check out our
awesome mood lighting!

216
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,416
"One card's in the light.

217
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,875
Before it becomes
too bright to see"

218
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,875
You think it's up
there with the lights?

219
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,166
Miss Tokaku! There!

220
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,416
[TOKAKU gasps]

221
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,541
[TOKAKU grunts]

222
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,916
The second card.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
[HARU]
A joker?

224
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,083
I almost forgot to mention.

225
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,375
In our case a joker stands
for the number zero.

226
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,250
[TOKAKU]
A seven and a zero.

227
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,833
[SUZU] I must admit,
you're doing very well.

228
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,333
Only two cards left.

229
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,125
[HARU]
"One card is in the forest.

230
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,125
In the best place to hide it.
One card is in the water.

231
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,291
In exchange for
something you care about."

232
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,875
Alright then.
There's the forest.

233
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,166
And there's the water.
So what's the best place?

234
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,291
Well, if you wanna hide a leaf,

235
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,416
the best place to
do it is the forest.

236
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,125
[TOKAKU] Yeah, but what we're
looking for isn't a leaf.

237
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,625
It's a card.

238
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,333
[HARU]
Where are you going?

239
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,708
[SUZU]
What are you doing?

240
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,958
You looked through those
cards earlier, remember?

241
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,000
I told you before
they're a red herring.

242
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,958
I found it!

243
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,541
The ace of spades.

244
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,250
[SUZU]
Nicely done.

245
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,500
So the remaining card
is in the water.

246
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,375
"In exchange for
something you care about."

247
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,375
I care about?

248
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,500
[bang]

249
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,208
[TOKAKU gasps]
Ichinose!

250
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,625
Whoa! Was that the explosion?

251
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,125
Happy Birthday, Shuto! Woo!

252
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,625
[ISUKE]
It's her birthday today?

253
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,000
[MIZOROGI]
You should have told us.

254
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,791
Then maybe we could've
planned a special party

255
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,583
for you or something.

256
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,166
It's not much.

257
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,250
But it's the best
I could come up with.

258
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,791
Hope you like flowers.

259
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,541
Sorry, sir. Technically,
men aren't allowed in here.

260
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,041
[MIZOROGI]
Uh!

261
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,083
[ISUKE] Oh! Was the birthday
magic trick just an excuse

262
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,791
to come and sneak a peep, teach?

263
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,000
Clever, Mr. Mizorogi.

264
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,833
That is ridiculous!
What are you talking about?

265
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,208
[SHINYA] Listen up,
you dirty old pervert.

266
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,916
Get lost, or else!

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,083
Hang on, Banba. Just relax.

268
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,791
There's no reason
for you to threaten me.

269
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,083
[MIZOROGI]
Hey! No! Stay back!

270
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,000
I just wanted to come
celebrate Shuto's birthday!

271
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,375
Is today seriously
your birthday?

272
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,791
I suppose.

273
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,583
[NIO]
Well, Happy Birthday then!

274
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,041
Oh, if you complete the
mission today the reward

275
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,916
will make the perfect
birthday present won't it?

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,166
It would actually be
a dream come true.

277
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,833
[NIO]
So what do you want anyway?

278
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,791
I haven't even
checked in with you yet.

279
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,833
My one and only wish
is to finally grow old,

280
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,083
and eventually die.

281
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,416
[NIO] Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

282
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,541
[SUZU] My body is being
held hostage by a disease.

283
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,166
An illness that
prevents me from aging.

284
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,125
[NIO] I think I've
heard about this.

285
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,750
Oh yeah. It's called
Highlander Syndrome, isn't it?

286
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,500
It actually sounds
kind of awesome

287
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,916
because you'd get to
stay young forever!

288
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,125
[SUZU] Does that really
sound so appealing?

289
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,875
[NIO gasps]

290
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,833
Time always marches forward.
And I'm always left behind.

291
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,375
You see, I once
cared for someone.

292
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,625
[SUZU]
He...

293
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,208
He was only one year
younger than me.

294
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,375
And my birthday was
the day before his.

295
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,916
But before he could
catch up to my age,

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,083
my birthday would come
and I'd be another year

297
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,791
ahead of him again.

298
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,208
We used to joke and laugh
with one another about

299
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,375
how we would never
be the same age.

300
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,333
Before long, he grew into
a man right before my eyes.

301
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,583
And it became painfully clear
to me that I would never

302
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,750
grow out of this child's body.

303
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,583
He had outpaced me.

304
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:32,458
And in time, he disappeared
from my life to be with another.

305
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,916
[SUZU]
And so, my wish is to grow old.

306
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,375
To age normally and die
like everyone else.

307
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,916
[NIO]
Roger that.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,291
We'll put together a team of
the best doctors and scientists

309
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,291
from around the world and
they'll tackle the problem

310
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,208
in no time at all.

311
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,916
Very good.

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,625
[HARU]
Miss Shuto...

313
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,208
[KAIBA]
There are only a handful left.

314
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,250
So why do you keep
dragging your feet?

315
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:04,083
Hm, Tokaku?
Here's the next riddle.

316
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,500
And if you don't answer
it soon, then someone else

317
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,750
is gonna beat you to the punch.

318
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:15,208
[phone vibrating]

319
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,291
[TOKAKU] Alright.
"One card's in the water."

320
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,791
Where is it?

321
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,583
[HARU]
In the water.

322
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,125
[TOKAKU]
In the water.

323
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,750
Does this count as water?

324
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,833
No, it doesn't freakin' count!

325
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,458
Hurry up guys!
You're running out of time!

326
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,875
Are you gonna let her
explode in front of everyone?

327
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,041
[NIO giggles]

328
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,666
[TOKAKU]
In the water.

329
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,916
What does, "in exchange for
something you care about" mean?

330
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,041
[TOKAKU]
How could I have missed that?

331
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,875
There's water flowing top to
bottom through those slides!

332
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,000
Wha--?

333
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
Miss Tokaku!

334
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,166
[TOKAKU]
Damn it!

335
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,375
[TOKAKU]
What's that? A key card?

336
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,750
Will it open the cage?
That's the fourth card.

337
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,875
Wait...

338
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,125
[TOKAKU]
"One card is in the water.

339
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,500
In exchange for
something you care about."

340
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,791
If I use this, I'll be saved.

341
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,875
But in exchange,
the card will be lost.

342
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,333
I have to sacrifice myself
in order to save her.

343
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,541
[TOKAKU] Ichinose! I've
gotta get her this card!

344
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,041
[TOKAKU]
No. Please don't do it.

345
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,250
[inaudible]

346
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,166
[TOKAKU gasping]

347
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,166
Made it! Are you alright?

348
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,125
I'm fine. But now we've
lost the fourth card.

349
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,875
And we're outta time.

350
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,666
[TOKAKU] We know three
of the four numbers.

351
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,125
Seven, zero, and one.

352
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,750
We have no choice now but
to guess the last number.

353
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,708
And there's yet another problem.

354
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,500
Even if you do
know all the digits,

355
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,000
you still don't know
which order to enter them.

356
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,708
Just leave it to me you guys!

357
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,083
I like to switch it up, but
today, my lucky number is nine.

358
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,291
You idiot!

359
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,166
That leaves only
one attempt left.

360
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,041
And I gotta think fast here.

361
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,125
We've got zero, seven, and one.
What's the last digit?

362
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,333
[TOKAKU gasps]

363
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,875
Happy Birthday Shuto! Woo!

364
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,458
[TOKAKU] It's her birthday.
Today is July 14th.

365
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,583
The passcode has to be
zero, seven, one, four.

366
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,208
She used her birthday?
That's like at the top

367
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,750
of the list of things not to
use for your password.

368
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,666
Have you got any better ideas?

369
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,916
We're just gonna
have to gamble on it.

370
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,583
[HARU]
Wait, Miss Tokaku!

371
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,416
[SUZU] You see,
I once cared for someone.

372
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,041
And my birthday was
the day before his.

373
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,875
Don't you remember
the gentleman in the story

374
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,458
Shuto was telling us.

375
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,208
She mentioned that his birthday
was the day after hers.

376
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,458
The way she talked about him,

377
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,125
I don't think the number
is her birthday.

378
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,541
[TOKAKU gasps]

379
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,250
[TOKAKU sighs]

380
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,708
[HARU]
Miss Tokaku!

381
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,916
You saved me.

382
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,250
[SUZU] His birthday
has come once again.

383
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,625
I have to hand it to you.
You're quite observant, Haru.

384
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,416
[HARU]
I guess so.

385
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,875
I can admit when I've lost.

386
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,083
[NIO]
Wait, Shuto.

387
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,541
[SUZU]
Hm?

388
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,500
How about it. You wanna tell
us how old you really are?

389
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,666
No one knows.
Not even me anymore.

390
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,541
[KAIBA] One gate to Heaven
and one gate to Hell.

391
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,666
And before them,
stand two gatekeepers.

392
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,750
One speaks only truth,
while the other, only lies.

393
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,083
You have just one chance
to get into heaven.

394
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,375
To pick the right gate,
what question do you ask?
