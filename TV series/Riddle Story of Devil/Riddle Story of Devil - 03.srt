1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,041
If any of you try to kill her,

2
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,250
you'll have to go
through me first.

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,708
Boom! Haru's meat shield
ready to tenderize!

4
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,583
[SHIENA] You plan on defending
that girl, seriously?

5
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,333
[SUZU] Are we sure that's even
permitted within the rules?

6
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,291
No one ever said that you
couldn't become a protector.

7
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,833
Though, outright abandoning
the assassination itself

8
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,250
might be a different matter.

9
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,083
[NIO]
Well. Let me check!

10
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,416
Nio here.

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,666
We've got something
unexpected going down.

12
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,000
You see...

13
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,125
That's fine. It's nothing
we didn't anticipate.

14
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:14,833
Azuma is permitted to assume the
role of Ichinose's protector.

15
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,041
[NIO] Don't know why, but she
got the okay, no problem.

16
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,708
Then that settles it.

17
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:24,541
Righty-o! 11 assassins and
one protector it is, then.

18
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:28,000
[NIO] The secret orientation
is officially closed!

[alarm beeping]

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,375
[OTOYA]
Will you shut up?

21
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,583
[OTOYA] Ow, my hand!
[SHIENA screams]

22
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,875
[SHIENA] Do you always
smash your alarm clock?

23
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,708
Sorry, Shiena. I messed up.

24
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,041
I can barely tell
left from right!

25
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,500
That's a pretty weak excuse.

26
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,375
Well, no worries. These
things happen after all.

27
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,083
That's why I always have
a spare pair at the ready!

28
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,291
Huh?

29
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm guessing
something's missing.

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,958
That's okay! There's
a spare spare-pair!

31
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,666
Wha-- They're gone!

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh no!

33
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,958
[OTOYA] It is just not
shaping up to be your day,

34
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,541
is it, Shiena?

35
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,000
You're giving notice?

36
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:55,083
And the first one up?
Otoya Takechi! I cannot wait!

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,500
[TOKAKU] I meant what
I told them last night,

38
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,875
but what's my plan? I need one.

39
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,583
Do I really let her live?

40
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,416
Just risk it all
protecting this girl?

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,375
Or should I strike now?

42
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,708
Take her out and not let
anyone else have the chance?

43
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,041
[HARU] Mother...
[TOKAKU gasps]

44
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,541
[HARU whimpers]

45
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,750
[TOKAKU] Even in her dreams,
she cries for her mother...

46
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,583
Mother...

47
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,416
[HARU]
No... I can't...

48
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,250
...eat any more food
right now, I'm just so full!

49
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,041
But I'll keep chewing.
The doughnuts are so good!

50
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,916
And the melon buns are, too!

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,791
[TOKAKU]
Time to wake up, Ichinose.

52
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,708
You're just dreaming!

53
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,666
[HARU screams]
M-Miss Tokaku!

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,541
Oh! Good morning!

55
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,166
[TOKAKU] That was quite
surprising. Don't think I've

56
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,458
ever seen anyone eating
in their sleep before.

57
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,291
What? But that's a
perfectly normal thing!

58
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,416
If you eat in your dream,
you eat for real.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,708
It just sorta happens!

60
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,833
[TOKAKU]
Maybe.

61
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,083
I've never chewed
on my sheets though.

62
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,750
Oh, hey, good morning, you two!

63
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,500
Hi, Harucchi!

64
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,041
Huh? Harucchi?

65
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,875
[HITSUGI]
Good morning, everyone!

66
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,500
And to you as well!

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,875
Harucchi. Wanna walk with me?

68
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:10,583
Sure!

69
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,666
[OTOYA]
Hooray!

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,000
[HARU]
So is Harucchi like a nickname?

71
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
[SUMIREKO]
Good morning, everyone.

72
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,791
It's lovely to see you all.

73
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,750
[KOUKO] Really? You brought
your own chair and desk?

74
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,875
[SUMIREKO] Yes, I requested
approval from the principal

75
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,458
and was granted permission.

76
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,208
Though I imagine it may
cause some annoyance

77
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,250
for you all, I do
hope you'll endure.

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,750
You know, come to think
of it, I'm pretty sure

79
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,166
that there's a conglomerate
called Hanabusa.

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,791
Bet that chick's loaded.

81
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,041
And I think I just found
my new best friend!

Wow, high society
life's so different.

Ichinose, what's the matter?

86
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,750
Oh, it's nothing, don't worry!

87
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,250
Good morning, Class Black!

[MIZOROGI] Everyone ready
for another fun filled day?

89

Oh. Miss Hanabusa's here, too!

90
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,041
That means the 13
members of Class Black

91
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,083
are all together at long last!

Excuse me. Kenmochi's not here.

93

[MIZOROGI]
Hm? Miss Kenmochi's absent?

94
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,583
[OTOYA] She'll just be in
late today. She said something

95
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,166
about sending her broken
glasses out for repair.

96
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,708
[MIZOROGI]
Well that's disappointing.

97
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,666
She could've said
something to me.

98
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,000
[HARU] I don't want anyone else
dying for my sake ever again.

She can't know. I will
survive this on my own!

[KAIBA]
Riddle me this.

105
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,958
What is red, but is not red?

Good luck figuring
this one out, Tokaku.

[MIZOROGI] Today, our first

This place has
a botanical garden?

110
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,083
Guess the school
is loaded, too.

Miss Kenmochi, you doing
alright without your glasses?

112

Things are a little blurry,
but I'll make do.

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,625
Oh the repairs will
take until tomorrow?

114
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,416
I'm so sorry!

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,541
That's great. There's nothing
holding us back then!

116
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,791
[MIZOROGI] This botanical
garden contains approximately

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,958
2,500 species of plants.

118
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,333
Some of which are exotic
and extremely rare!

119
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,500
But none can compare to
the exquisite peacock moss!

00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,333
Do you have any hand lotion?
My skin is need of moisturizing.

123
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,791
Sorry, but I didn't
bring any with me today.

124
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,250
So then, you're useless.

125

[HARUKI] Hey, Mistress Isuke,
I've got some right here for ya!

126

Fine.

[TOKAKU]
Something red, but not red.

129
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,916
Being caught red handed
or cutting red tape, maybe?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,083
Huh? Well, excuse me, class!

131
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,083
Sorry if you find the subject
of biological botany boring!

132
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,458
But plants aren't the only
things alive in this garden.

133
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,458
There are plenty of
insects and types of birds

134
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,541
living in this habitat
as well, you know.

138
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,208
Not an actual bull,
I meant the bullfinch.

139
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,166
[MIZOROGI] Calm down, it's just
a bird. And that's no bull!

Red herrings. Lies.

142
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,416
[MIZOROGI sighs]
The bullfinch is classified

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,541
in the Fringillidae family
of the Passeriformes order.

144
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,458
Its cry is distinctive
in that it sounds like

145
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,541
a person whistling. So much so,
that in some other languages...

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,416
[HARUKI] Yum!
[OTOYA] Chinese food, huh?

159
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,125
It's been a while.
Sweet-and-sour pork

160
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,291
does sound good!

161
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,250
I'm not really a big
fan of the pineapple

162
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,041
in sweet-and-sour pork.

163
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,958
[OTOYA]
Wait! You, too?

164
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,541
Nothing against pineapple,
but it's really got no place

165
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,916
in sweet-and-sour pork at all!

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,250
Yeah! I know!

167
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,791
So then, Harucchi.

168
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,333
Which of these do you
like better: bread or rice?

169
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
That's easy, I like rice more!

170
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,166
No way!

171
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,250
I like rice more
than bread, too!

172
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,375
Oh wow!

173
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,916
We even like the same kinds--

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,708
[TOKAKU] Takechi. Why don't
you quit being such a bother?

175
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,208
Miss Tokaku...

176
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,291
What's wrong?

177
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,875
We're getting to
know each other.

178
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,541
And Haru and I have
just really hit it off.

179
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,625
"Just hit it off"? Right...

180
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,208
What, it's true!

181
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,458
Even my birthday and Takechi's
are separated by only one day.

182
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,958
It's so cool!

183
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,500
I've never had so much in common
with someone else before.

184
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,875
[TOKAKU grunts]

185
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,125
It's basic
similarity attraction.

186
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,416
Don't you think so?
People feel closer

187
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,375
when they truly believe
that they're alike.

188
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,583
Very true.

189
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,458
So you also see
through her lies?

190
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,166
Yeah. Takechi's eyes
give her away.

191
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,375
This is nothing
more than a ruse.

192
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,041
Oh! But, I would also
pick rice over bread.

193
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,666
As would I.

194
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,583
[TOKAKU] You really believe
your birthdays are that close?

195
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,250
She's lying through her teeth
and you don't get that?

196
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,083
[HARU]
Miss Tokaku, you're scary.

197
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,875
Besides, she has no reason
to lie to me 'bout that.

198
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,250
[TOKAKU] Sure, she does!
She's only trying to get close

199
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,375
to you so you'll
lower your guard!

200
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,791
Well maybe but...

201
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,750
What if she really
wants to be friends now

202
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,125
'cause we have
so much in common?

203
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,583
That's freaking ridiculous!

204
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,041
They're all assassins!
How can you not realize that?

205
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,333
Your life is in danger here!

206
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,416
Listen. Here's what
you need to know.

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,333
[TOKAKU]
Class Black's rules.

208
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,375
They'll grant any
wish to the winner,

209
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,333
the student who
successfully assassinates you.

210
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,875
An advanced notice will be given
to you, and within 48 hours,

211
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
an attempt will be
made on your life.

212
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,875
[HARU] But, you said that you
wanted to protect me, right?

213
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,125
Takechi. She might also want to.

214
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,291
[HARU]
And not just Takechi.

215
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,916
If I can get everyone in
the class to become friends

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,750
with me too, then...

217
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,708
Well, then...

218
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
No one has to die.

219
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,500
And then we can all graduate
from Class Black together.

220
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,250
[TOKAKU grunts]

221
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,541
[NIO] So, you've sent
your advanced notice.

222
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,875
You and I need to discuss
your reward in the event

223
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,875
that you succeed.

224
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,416
Basically, I want
serial killer insurance.

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
[NIO laughs]
The heck is that?

226
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,291
I'm in the dark here, so if you
wouldn't mind elaborating some.

227
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:03,208
[OTOYA] Simply put, I wanna
be a fulltime serial killer.

228
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,541
And I'd like to do without
a care in the world,

229
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,791
and no complications.

230
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,250
[NIO gasps]

231
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,125
[OTOYA] Things are pretty
rough for me at the moment.

232
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,291
Half the reason I'm here is
to lay low from this detective.

233
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,791
He's been on my tail
for a while now.

234
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,375
Oh. So keep detective-guy
away from you. Got it.

235
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,750
[OTOYA]
That is not gonna cut it.

236
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,833
I said "insurance" after all.
I want to be guaranteed

237
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,250
that those bastards
will never find me.

238
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,500
And that I'll always be
protected from them no matter

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,708
how many murders I
commit, you get me?

240
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,041
[NIO]
Ah-ha!

241
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,791
You want a clean-up crew
for all the little messes

242
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,166
you're bound to make in life.

243
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,541
[OTOYA]
Now you get it.

244
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,750
An absolute promise of security.

245
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,041
I mean, I'm not
asking for a lot.

246
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,958
Hey, um...

247
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:56,958
[TOKAKU]
What is it?

248
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,750
[HARU]
Are you still mad at me?

249
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,125
I'm not mad at you.
Just disappointed, that's all.

250
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,333
[OTOYA]
Hey!

251
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,250
That's Harucchi's
cell phone charm.

252
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,958
These are great, aren't they?
I absolutely love mine!

253
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,500
Ye-Yeah. It is great.

254
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,708
[OTOYA] What did you think
about that test this morning?

255
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,500
Talk about a nail-biter, huh?

256
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,708
Don't know about you,
but it brought out my talents!

257
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,041
[MAHIRU]
Click.

258
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Huh? What was that for?
Why'd you make that sound?

259
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,750
I locked it away.

260
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,875
[OTOYA laughs]
Sorry! But you lost me there.

261
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,958
Maybe you'd make more
sense if I talked to you

262
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,625
after the sun sets.
Although, I think...

263
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,875
We have a lot more
in common in the day.

264
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,458
[MAHIRU gasps]

265
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,166
This cell phone strap?
Our classmates don't see

266
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,125
why something so small
is such a lovely prize.

267
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,625
But the two of us?

268
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,708
We see the true value
of this trophy, don't we?

269
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,375
[HARU]
What are you talking about?

270
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,083
[OTOYA]
Oh, Harucchi!

271
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,750
We were talking about you!

272
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,666
You see, we adore the cell
phone charms you made us.

273
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
We both think that
they're totally super cute!

274
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,958
So I wanna give
you something, too.

275
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,041
Oh, don't worry! Really.
I don't need anything.

276
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,791
[TOKAKU] If I do end up
having to fight someone,

277
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,500
how should I report it?

278
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,916
She hasn't received a notice
yet, so she's safe for now.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,375
Although...

280
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,250
Wait.

281
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,916
What if she has already received
one and just not told me?

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,125
[TOKAKU panting]

283
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,541
Tch!

284
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,041
[OTOYA] Oh, wow, Harucchi,
you're so amazing!

285
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
[HARU laughs]

286
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,333
Oh, that's right!

287
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,833
Ta-da! Here!

288
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,333
I got these just for you!

289
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,125
Can't get over how
pretty they are.

290
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,916
They're beautiful!

291
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,333
I'm glad you like them, I was
kinda worried you wouldn't.

292
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,291
Once Miss Tokaku sees these,

293
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,458
I know that she'll realize how
wrong she's been about you!

294
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,666
[OTOYA]
Ugh. Don't think about her.

295
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,916
Just us.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,041
It's nice having you all
to myself for a change.

297
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,625
Um, what? Takechi, wait...

298
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,500
You don't feel uncomfortable
without her here

299
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,541
to protect you from
the assassins, do you?

300
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,166
[HARU gasps]

301
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,333
[OTOYA]
It'll be okay.

302
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,625
'Cause I can protect
you, too, you know?

303
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,958
Someone gave you an
advanced notice yesterday.

304
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,041
How'd you know about that?

305
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,875
I know who it came from.
It was Shiena.

306
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,250
[OTOYA] I saw it in our room
before she delivered it to you.

307
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,625
So I shattered her glasses

308
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,458
before she woke up
the next morning.

309
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,791
I did it to protect you.

310
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,625
[HARU]
Takechi...

311
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,000
[OTOYA] Without her glasses,
she can hardly see.

312
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,375
She can't attack.

313
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
And even if she did
try to make a move,

314
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,708
fighting her off would
be a total breeze!

315
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,375
But of course,
those are all lies.

316
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,166
These flowers are the
Gelseemium Elegans,

317
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,500
which contain a powerful
debilitating neurotoxin.

318
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,208
I doubt that Mr. Mizorogi
even knows about that one.

319
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,625
Are you here?

320
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,666
[TOKAKU]
Damn!

321
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,958
[TOKAKU]
I was right!

322
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,458
[door clicks]

323
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,458
[TOKAKU]
Takechi, is this yours?

324
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,541
What have you
done with Ichinose?

325
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,375
What are you babbling?

326
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,333
Harucchi went down to
the basement for something

327
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,500
with Shiena just
a few minutes ago.

328
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,791
[TOKAKU gasps]

329
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,625
Ichinose!

330
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,791
[TOKAKU grunts]
Damn it!

331
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,416
[ISUKE, HARUKI sigh]

332
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,750
[HARUKI] Hey. Kenmochi,
your glasses are all fixed up.

333
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,541
Yeah! I just got 'em back.

334
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,375
It's nice being
able to see again.

335
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,000
While I do
sympathize with you,

336
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,541
why wear them in the bath?

337
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,208
Oh, I get it, you're trying
to get an eyeful, aren't you?

338
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,708
[SHIENA] Stop reading into it!
That's not my thing!

339
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,750
[SUZU] Well, I'm glad
that you got them fixed.

340
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,208
Seeing as you're roomed
with Otoya Takechi,

341
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,458
I bet you must have been
feeling pretty on edge.

342
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,291
[SHIENA]
Huh? What do you mean by that?

343
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,625
Oh, seriously?
You really don't know?

344
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,791
[SHIENA]
Know what?

345
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,000
Well it's probably
best if you don't.

346
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,750
After all, as the old saying
goes, ignorance is bliss.

347
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,750
[SHIENA]
Huh?

348
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,375
[HARUKI]
What's this about Takechi?

349
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,875
[ISUKE]
I wanna know!

350
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,041
If you got dirt on that chick,
you better spill it quick!

351
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,208
You big tease.

352
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,958
Hang on. So none
of you know then?

353
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,875
[SUZU]
Well, she's a...

354
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,458
Finally...

355
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,500
With no one to bother us,
we'll just take our time.

356
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,500
There's no rush, right?

357
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,125
[banging]

358
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:45,166
[TOKAKU panting]

359
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,791
[SHIENA]
I had no idea...

360
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,750
Ew! I can't believe
I've been sleeping

361
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,708
next to a serial killer!

362
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,791
[SUZU] Even serial killers
come in a wide variety.

363
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,500
In this case, Takechi
kills for pleasure.

364
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,125
She constantly lusts for
satisfaction and can only

365
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,000
get off when there's
a victim involved.

366
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,041
[KOUKO] In a weird sort of way,
I kind of feel sorry for her.

367
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,625
Don't feel sorry for her!
Feel sorry for me!

368
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,791
My personal space
has been invaded!

369
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
Hey, at least you aren't
one of her victims, yet.

370
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,291
[SHIENA growls]

371
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,666
[GIRLS]
Huh?

372
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,333
[HARUKI] Azuma?
[TOKAKU] Kenmochi!

373
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,291
Tell me what you did
with Ichinose. Now.

374
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,541
Whoa! Hold on!

375
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,416
It wasn't me! That notice
came from Takechi!

376
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,666
[TOKAKU gasps]

377

[HARU muffled grunting]

378
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,166
[OTOYA] Oh, good, you're
finally awake! There's no fun

379
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,458
in killing you all quick
and easy, so you just relax!

380
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,916
The 48 hour time limit
isn't up for a while now.

381
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,250
So let's just worry
about having some fun.

382
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,750
[OTOYA]
Hey, did you know this?

383
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,416
Spiders dissolve the insides
of the prey they've caught

384
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,458
with their venomous fangs
and then they suck out

385
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,208
all the yummy juices.

386
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,500
Their meal remains alive as,
bit by bit, it's killed.

387
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,375
Bit by itsy-bitsy little bit.

388
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,333
Can you imagine that?

389
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,291
It gives me goosebumps!

390
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,375
I don't have any
venomous fangs of my own,

391
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,541
but I get by just
fine with these.

392
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:24,000
I also kill my prey bit by bit,
by itsy-bitsy little bit.

393
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,833
[OTOYA]
You have such beautiful scars.

394
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,583
This is the first time I've had
any dotted lines to cut along.

you are, you bitch!

Man, did you have
to ruin my foreplay?

00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,625
But, it's still all good.
Your precious Haru

like any fun at all!

You are not gonna
get away from me!

are you? Ichinose!

I've got you. Hold still.

00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,666
Miss Tokaku...
Thank you so much.

425
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,333
Morning! Ready for
your walk of shame?

426
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,916
Its 48 hours on the nose.
You're all out of time.

[OTOYA]
No! No, please!

428
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,750
Forget my reward, just let
me stay in Class Black!

429
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,208
Please! I desperately want
to kill her! I need to!

430
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,750
There are no continues.
Your game's over.

[MIZOROGI]
Well,

435
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,083
I'm afraid I have some
sad news for everyone.

436
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,583
It's caught me
a little off guard,

437
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,125
but Miss Takechi has
transferred schools.

438
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,666
Unfortunately, she'll
no longer be joining us.

00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,375
Huh? Hold on.

440
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,458
Has anyone seen Hashiri,
Azuma or Ichinose this morning?

441
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,833
Ugh. More tardies already?

442
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,083
You're safe. I'm right here.

443
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,000
[KAIBA] It's said that a
teacher's favorite students

444
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,416
are not the ones who excel,

445
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,583
but often those
who struggle the most.

446
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,666
However, in the end,
nothing tops competency.

447
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,250
Yo, Tokaku, do you
truly comprehend

448
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,416
why you were enrolled
in Class Black?
