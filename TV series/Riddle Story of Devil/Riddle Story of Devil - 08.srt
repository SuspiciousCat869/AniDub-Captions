1
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,125
[phone ringing]

2
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,375
Hello, dear.
Is everything alright?

3
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,166
[ISUKE]
I know it's late, Mom,

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,250
but do you have a
quick minute to talk?

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,791
[EISUKE]
Of course.

6
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,708
I'm just tidying up right now.
So, what's the matter?

7
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,250
I expected you
to be home by now.

8
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,291
[EISUKE]
Here I thought

9
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,125
my daughter
personified punctuality.

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,333
The job's cake. It's in
the bag, It's just that...

11
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,083
Well, there's one
minor problem...

12
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,041
[EISUKE]
Really?

13
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,875
[ISUKE]
A real pain in my ass!

14
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,416
I can't decide if she's a
wolf in sheep's clothing,

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,250
or if it's just that her bark
is worse than her bite.

16
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,666
Well, either way, I guess
it doesn't really matter.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,708
[EISUKE laughs]

18
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,291
[ISUKE]
What now?

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,416
It's funny. This is
just so unlike you.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,958
Showing any fear at all.

21
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,875
[ISUKE]
I am not afraid of her!

22
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,416
It is through adversity
that children grow.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,625
Although it is
a little bittersweet.

24
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,708
Your daddy is really missing
his baby girl, however.

25
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,208
So hurry home soon?

26
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,583
What, just Daddy?

27
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,958
[EISUKE] Of course,
Mommy misses you as well.

28
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,833
That's what I thought!
And just you wait, Mom.

29
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,958
I'm gonna bring home
tons of souvenirs

30
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,916
for you and for Daddy!

31
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,000
[ISUKE] Oh, hey, where would you
rather live after you retire?

32
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,708
Somewhere in the Alps,
or a beach in the Caribbean?

33
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,125
[CHAIRPERSON] This generation's
Class Black has proven itself

34
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,791
to be quite entertaining.

35
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,583
I have to say, your hard work
has truly paid off, Nio.

36
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,083
To think that only three
still remain. How sad.

37
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,458
Uh, there's four.
I'm still in there, too.

38
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,333
Oh, yes. That's true.
My apologies.

39
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,166
Eh. It's okay.

40
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,208
[CHAIRPERSON] Considering the
nature of Hanabusa's wish,

41
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,333
I don't foresee her making
a move until the very end.

42
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:08,166
The next play will then be made
by either Inukai or Banba.

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,916
Inukai desires money,
while Banba desires...?

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,416
Nada!

45
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, my! Then we're
in for quite a show.

46
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,666
So, any thoughts?

47
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,375
Haru Ichinose? Or Tokaku Azuma?

48
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,250
[CHAIRPERSON]
They certainly show promise.

49
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,125
As it stands,
there may very well rise

50
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,291
a new Queen Bee in the end.
But then there may not.

51
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,708
[NIO]
So then, you're still not sure?

52
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,166
[CHAIRPERSON] No. Who can say
what tomorrow will bring?

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,000
For that is the nature
of our little endeavor.

54
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,000
[CHAIRPERSON]
This does take me back though.

55
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,583
I'm reminded of my own time
as a young girl in Class Black.

56
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,333
How many days did it take
for you to graduate, ma'am?

57
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,333
Only six.

58
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,041
Hoo!

59
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,833
[CHAIRPERSON] I see
there's a storm on its way.

60
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,500
[HARU] It's gotten really lonely
these past few days, hasn't it?

61
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,833
Everywhere we go
is so quiet now.

62
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,291
It feels like we're
the only two here anymore.

63
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,000
[TOKAKU] And that's
exactly why we can bathe

64
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,125
without worrying now.
I'd call that a plus.

65
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,916
[HARU]
Jeez! That's cold.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,291
[TOKAKU gasps]

67
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,625
Well! Look who's here!

68
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,250
[HARU gasps]

69
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,708
[SHINYA]
Huh? Aw, no need to be shy...

70
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,833
[HARU whimpers]

71
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,541
Does it really look
like I'd hurt you?

72
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,208
[SHINYA] Must be my lucky day
to see you two at the bath.

73
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,458
You never really come
here much. It's such a shame.

74
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,583
To waste a good bath
like this one.

75
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,666
Then, uh, Mahi--
Shinya, you always bathe here?

76
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,000
You bet. Mahiru likes
'em big. Bigger is better.

77
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,750
[SHINYA] You know,
come to think of it,

78
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,041
Nio and Sumireko haven't
used this bath yet either.

79
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,166
Maybe they've also
got scars to hide.

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,250
What do you think?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,083
[SHINYA laughs]
Oh man!

82
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,541
Mahiru has been
busting my ass lately!

83
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,333
I've been telling her she
needs to back off and relax.

84
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,333
[HARU]
Why? What's wrong?

85
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,708
You see, she'd been locked up
for a long time as a kid.

86
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,125
She never did nothing like go
to school and stuff like that.

87
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,250
So I was hoping she'd
get the most outta this

88
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,791
while she still could, you know?

89
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,708
[SHINYA] This is really
her first time to do

90
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,250
something normal
in life for a change.

91
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,666
But, hell. She might
have a point. It's time.

92
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,958
Okay! Night, night,
girls! Sweet dreams!

93
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,916
The next fight's
with her. Watch.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,541
[HARU gasps]

95
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,041
[TOKAKU]
That's just how it is now.

96
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,541
[HARU]
Yeah, but...

97
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,166
[TOKAKU]
There're only three left.

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,250
But once we've dealt with them,
it'll be all over and done with.

99
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,208
Isn't it your dream,
living long enough

100
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,541
to graduate from Class Black?

101
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,583
[HARU]
What about you?

102
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,083
Huh?

103
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,958
Once we've graduated from here,
what are you going to do?

104
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,625
[TOKAKU gasps]

105
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,250
Let's go to bed.

106
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,125
[SHINYA] I really hate
seeing you like this.

107
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,541
After all, the whole
reason that I'm even here

108
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,666
is to make you smile.

109
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,083
[MAHIRU]
I want it. My trophy.

110
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,750
I have it already, but it
doesn't mean anything yet.

111
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,958
My trophy. I want my trophy!

112
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,541
I want it. I want it now!

113
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,208
It needs value! Please, hurry!

114
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,291
Please!

115
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,166
[SHINYA]
Alright. I've heard enough.

116
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,083
[MAHIRU gasps]

117
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,458
You've been real
patient all this time.

118
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,541
Well then. Like always?

119
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,500
[SHINYA]
You just leave everything to me.

120
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,833
[MAHIRU sighs]

121
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,083
[SUMIREKO]
Miss Shinya?

122
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,708
[SHINYA gasps]

123
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
[SUMIREKO] I just brewed
a fresh pot of tea.

124
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,833
Would you care
for a cup with me?

125
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,291
[SHINYA]
Yeah, sure.

126
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,458
My, what a surprise
this is! You've declined

127
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,375
all of my previous
invitations without fail.

128
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,708
Yeah, well, what can I say?

129
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,416
[SUMIREKO] It would
appear that the typhoon

130
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,625
is quickly approaching. Landfall
is likely tomorrow afternoon.

131
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,208
[SHINYA] That's cool.
It'll make my party kickass.

132
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,250
Ah. We're toasting
in your honor tonight.

133
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,625
Doesn't have to be
just my honor.

134
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,750
Parties are more fun when more
people show up to 'em, right?

135
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,791
Yes, but I...

136
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,083
[SUMIREKO gasps]

137
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,041
Right. You wouldn't get nothing
doing it that way, would ya?

138
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,125
But, there's no way I'm gonna
let that hold me back.

139
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,541
Um. My bad! I guess.

140
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,750
Sometimes I just don't
know my own strength.

141
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,958
Please think nothing of it.

142
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,708
[SUMIREKO] Everything is
destined for ruin in the end.

143
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,375
Thank goodness for free
nights and weekends, huh?

144
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,958
Your family must
be close if they're

145
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,958
taking your calls this late.

146
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
[ISUKE]
Of course they are.

147
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,666
After all, I am
their only daughter.

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,791
And such a devoted one.
Who'd have guessed?

149
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,833
You're parents sure
are lucky to have you!

150
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,208
But you can't really
pick your family, huh?

151
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,250
You said you wanna build
them a vacation home,

152
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,750
isn't that right?

153
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,708
[NIO] Oh, by the way, there's a
typhoon coming straight for us.

154
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,833
I'm kinda excited
about it, truth be told.

155
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,291
The big ones really get
the blood pumpin', you know!

156
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,291
It's like mother nature herself
is giving you a private show

157
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,958
from the safety of
your very own room.

158
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,916
[ISUKE]
So we're clear...

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,041
Hm?

160
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,125
Just because you bastards
have something planned,

161
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,250
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

[NIO laughs]

164
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,583
[MIZOROGI] As I'm sure
you're all aware, in nature,

165
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,291
all wildlife maintain various
relationships with one another

166
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,750
in order to coexist
as a population.

167
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,250
One such instance
of this is territoriality,

168
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,208
as exhibited by the sweetfish.

169
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,708
These guys lay claim to
territory within the river,

170
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,208
which thus enables them
to secure food and attack

171
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,250
any other predators that may
potentially invade their space.

172
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,375
It is because of this
behavior that sweetfish

173
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,916
decoy fishing is possible.
This process...

What about you?

Once we've graduated from here,
what are you going to do?

will return to the world

Alright, well that's
gonna be it for today!

You all be mindful
of the typhoon now.

with me on the way back?

I know a place that gives 30%
off when there's a typhoon!

190
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,750
But, Mr. Mizorogi said
we should all hurry back.

Oh come on, girl!
I live for these days!

192
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,833

you gotta embrace the danger

I just had a great idea!

We're gonna test your might!

Wait, what?

in the middle of the storm,

with only a flashlight
and a raincoat.

199
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
It'll be fun!

200
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,583
And I know the perfect
spot for our little game!

201
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
It used to be this
creepy cemetery,

202
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,583
but then they tore it down
so they could build this huge--

203

You can play your

[HARU]
Miss Tokaku...

205
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,500
Oh, don't tell me
the great Azuma

206
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,333
is too afraid to play. You sure
do have a good poker face.

207

But there's always a
chance that this storm

208
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,958
is the manifestation of rage

00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,041
So now you had better
be on the look out...

314
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,250
...for the deadly curses
of vengeful spirits!

315
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,750
[TOKAKU]
Curses?

316
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,500
[TOKAKU gasps, groans]

317
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,875
[ISUKE] You know, I find it
kind of hard to be frightened

318
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,916
when I know that your
attacks have no chance

319
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,583
of actually killing me.

320
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,791
[TOKAKU gasps]

321
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,916
Kill shots? You avoid
them unconsciously.

322
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,583
You won't strike anywhere
that'd make a fatal wound.

323
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,583
'Cause you know that if you did,
you'd freeze on the spot.

324
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,375
[TOKAKU gasps]

325
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,125
Tch!

326
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,625
[ISUKE laughs]
It's so ridiculous!

327
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,333
You've got everybody
on edge just because

328
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,458
you're a great
and powerful Azuma.

329
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,166
None of them suspect
for even a second

330
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,083
that you're actually a virgin.

331
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,833
Just imagine the
looks on their faces

332
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,750
if they ever
found out the truth!

333
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,041
[ISUKE laughs]

334
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,583
When you're ready.
Prove me wrong, you bitch.

335
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,333
Miss Tokaku...

336
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:26,500
[knocking, banging]

337
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,208
[HARU gasps]

338
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,333
[SHINYA]
What's up, Haru?

339
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:50,125
Nice weather we're having, huh?
Absolutely perfect for a party.

340
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,333
Sorry about the wait.

341
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,833
Welcome to die!

342
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,250
Huh?

343
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:08,875
Hm. Well, it sounds like
the main even has just begun.

344
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,041
[TOKAKU]
Say what?

345
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,500
I really wouldn't have
guessed it myself,

346
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,208
but it seems she's
pretty punctual, too.

347
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,958
That Banba...

348
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,541
[KAIBA]
Well, Tokaku. It would appear

349
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,125
you've brilliantly
chosen the gate to Hell.

350
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,208
But truth be told,
that's where both gates

351
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,625
have been leading all along.

352
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,500
I thought you'd have
caught on by now.

353
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,583
There's no chance the
path you're on is ever

354
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,625
going to take you to Heaven.
