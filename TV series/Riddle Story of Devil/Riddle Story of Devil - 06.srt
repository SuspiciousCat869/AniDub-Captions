1
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,791
[CHITARU]
Where are you trying to get to?

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,333
You want me to
help you find it?

3
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,000
Sure, if you don't mind.

4
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,333
I'm looking for
Myojo Private School.

5
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,791
Well that's bus number 6.
And you know what?

6
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,375
I'm headed there as well.

7
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,375
We can ride together
if you want.

8
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,875
That'd be great, yeah!
Thank you for being so nice.

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,083
[CHITARU]
Are you in grade school?

10
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,416
Don't you have a guardian?

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,125
[HITSUGI]
Huh? Oh, no.

12
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,541
I don't. Just me.

13
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,541
[STUDENTS cheering]

14
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,041
[HITSUGI]
Wow!

15
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,416
[CHITARU] The crowd seems
like they're really into this.

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,916
[HITSUGI giggles]

17
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,958
[DARTS BOOTH BOY 6A] Alright!
We've got a winner! Nice!

18
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,958
[HARU] That was awesome,
you're like a dart pro!

19
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,875
[TOKAKU] Yeah, thanks.
I'm not sure why you want this,

20
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,375
--but here you go.
[HARU giggles]

21
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,500
[HITSUGI gasps]

22
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,916
[CHITARU]
Uh--

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
[DARTS BOOTH BOY 6A]
And we have a winner!

24
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,333
[FOOD BOOTH BOY 6A]
Hot yakisoba!

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,791
[HITSUGI giggles]

26
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,583
I love it so much!
Thank you again, Chitaru!

27
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,125
You know... It still
really worries me

28
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,541
that a girl like you
is in Class Black.

29
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,000
Huh?

30
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,666
[CHITARU nervous laugh]

31
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,166
You don't need to worry,
I'll be fine.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,666
So what about you?

33
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,791
You said that Ichinose
wasn't your target,

34
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,125
but if she's not, then who is?

35
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,375
She goes by Angel's Trumpet.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,625
She's a coldblooded,
ruthless poisoner.

37
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,291
I know she must be here.

38
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,916
And I'm gonna find her
and take her down.

39
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,958
Me too. I'll do anything
I can to help you.

40
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,416
[HARU whimpering]

41
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,208
[SHIENA]
You can't be serious!

42
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,083
You have got to
get this part down!

43
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
We are opening tomorrow!

44
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,833
[HARU]
I know, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,125
Until you get this right,
we're gonna keep rehearsing!

46
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,500
Okay.

47
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,916
[TOKAKU]
C'mon.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,666
Thanks for grabbing it for me.

49
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,916
[CHITARU]
Ichinose is quite helpless.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,041
She's probably never even held a
sword before, wouldn't you say?

51
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,583
[SHIENA]
All right, one more time.

52
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,625
Let's take it from the scene
where Tybalt kills Mercutio.

53
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,416
So Azuma's playing a
character that murders Haru.

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,916
You've gotta love irony.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,125
[SHIENA]
Alright, guys.

56
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,666
Hurry up with those
costumes and make sure

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,750
you can move around
in them, okay? Tell Banba

58
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
if you have any issues so
she can fix them for you.

59
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,958
Nicely understated design.

60
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,708
I'm playing the nurse,
so why the hell

61
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,333
am I in a maid's uniform?

62
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,875
[SHIENA] Careful, a maid
shouldn't speak so casually.

63
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,875
Actually, Nurse.
She's not a maid.

64
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,416
No, but don't worry about it.

65
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,583
People will think it's
an artistic choice.

66
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,333
Oh wow, you look
incredible, Miss Hanabusa.

67
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,083
Thanks. And your costume
looks great on you too.

68
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,833
Uh. Do you think so?

69
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,708
Fine feathers do
improve the bird.

70
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,916
Hey, be nice!

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,208
They sure seem excited.

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,416
[HARU]
Hey, everyone. Look over here.

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,916
[ISUKE]
Really, you're taking pictures?

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,625
[NIO] Totes, yo!
A snapshot of our youth!

75
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,500
[CHITARU]
Well, I'm off.

76
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,500
You feeling up to checking out
the main bath with me?

77
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,708
[HITSUGI]
Oh, no thanks.

78
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,708
I'm pretty worn out
from rehearsals.

79
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,125
No worries. Later.

80
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,875
[door slams]

81
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,916
[TOKAKU] Hold on a minute!
Can't you look for it later?

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,791
[HARU] No. I really
need to find it now.

83
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
[TOKAKU]
Wait!

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,541
[SUZU]
Really? Kirigaya's not with you?

85
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,916
[CHITARU]
She already went to bed.

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,291
[SUZU]
Well, huh.

87
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,250
I don't think I've even seen
the two of you separated

88
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,041
since Class Black began.

89
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,291
[CHITARU sighs]

90
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,250
Me too. I'll do
anything I can to help.

91
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,125
[CHITARU] Did I do the
right thing by telling her?

92
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,291
[HARU] I just don't get where
my script could have gone.

93
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,833
I thought it would be
around here somewhere.

94
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,958
[TOKAKU] We better not find out
it was in your bag all along.

95
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,291
That would be annoying.

96
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,000
[HARU] Give me some credit,
I looked in my bag.

97
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, hey. Did you
look over there?

98
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,166
Behind those trees?

99
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,333
[SHIENA laughs]

100
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,708
[HITSUGI] You are quite
dedicated to work so late.

101
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,208
[SHIENA]
Uh. Yeah. I guess so.

102
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,958
[HITSUGI] You're making
your move on Ichinose

103
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
within the coming day, correct?

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,375
[SHIENA]
Why would you say...

105
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,958
Oh.

106
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,041
[HITSUGI] That's why you really
care so much about the play.

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm sorry, did you
forget something in here?

108
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,958
Oh, no. I'm making my own
preparations for tomorrow.

109
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,750
[SHIENA]
Uh?

110
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,041
[SHIENA whimpers]

111
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
[clatters]

112
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,125
[TOKAKU]
What do you think that was?

113
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,833
[HARU]
Whoa, wait!

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,208
[HARU]
It's Shiena!

115
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,291
Hey, stay back!

116
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,750
[TOKAKU]
Who's back there?

117
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,750
[HITSUGI] Of all the people
in class, it had to be you two

118
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,791
that come stumbling in.
Luck is not on my side tonight.

119
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,916
[HARU] But there's no way
that you did this.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
[TOKAKU]
Why would you take out Kenmochi?

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,166
[HITSUGI]
She got in my way,

122
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,708
so I had to remove
her from the picture.

123
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,333
[HITSUGI] Oh by the way,
I might as well go ahead

124
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,791
and give you mine, too.

125
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,541
[HARU gasps]

126
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,708
You've got a full day tomorrow!

127
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,916
Is this for real?

128
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,416
[MIZOROGI]
Sad news, guys.

129
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,625
Miss Kenmochi was hospitalized
last night for food poisoning.

130
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,250
She worked really hard.

131
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,166
Let's do this right and
make this play a success!

132
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,625
The poor thing was so gung-ho
about putting on this play.

133
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,250
You know, Azuma, you really
could have at least waited

134
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,000
until we were done
with the show.

135
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,166
[TOKAKU, HARU]
Huh?

136
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,541
What're you talking about?

137
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,875
C'mon. Are you really
gonna sit there and tell me

138
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,541
that you didn't do
this to protect Haru?

139
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,875
[CHITARU]
Azuma took her out?

140
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,000
[NIO] The hospital tests
said it was a poison needle

141
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,541
that brought her down.

142
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,375
[CHITARU gasps]
[ISUKE] Huh. Poison. Really?

143
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,083
And Shiena had issued
her advanced notice too.

144
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,333
Pretty strange. Now that she's
suddenly been hospitalized,

145
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,208
guess you can cross
her off the threat list.

146
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,250
[NIO]
Here ya go, peeps!

147
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,875
Class Black's production
of Romeo and Juliet.

148
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,041
Trust me, you don't
wanna miss it!

149
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,541
[STUDENT 6A]
I heard that every student

150
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
in Class Black is super hot!

151
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,583
[STUDENT 6B]
Should we go see it?

152
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,958
[STUDENT 6C]
Well, duh!

153
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,416
[HARU] For both ours and
Shiena's sake, I really hope

154
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,083
we're able to successfully
pull off this play.

155
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,958
[TOKAKU] You realize
she wanted to kill you?

156
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,083
[HARU laughs] Well, she
had good qualities too.

157
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,666
[TOKAKU]
Our Juliet on the other hand,

158
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,041
she'll try to poison you.

159
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,958
Be sure to keep your
distance from her.

160
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,166
And don't eat
anything else today.

161
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
Think you can do that?

162
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,208
[HARU]
Mm-hm.

163
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,666
I promise that I won't
let her hurt you.

164
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,125
Thank you.

165
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,625
Anytime. Now let's go
have a good show.

166
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,875
[HARU giggles]

167

[HITSUGI]
You know, you're really

168
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,250
such a lovely lady, Chitaru.
You look so pretty.

169
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,625
[CHITARU] Uh, thanks,
but I'm playing a man though.

170
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,041
You look much lovelier.

171
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,541
[HITSUGI giggles]
Oh, stop.

172

You're the beautiful one.

173
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,208
So about Angel's Trumpet...

174
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,166
Do you mind telling me
why you're trying to find her?

175
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,458
[CHITARU'S MENTOR]
I'll never understand.

176
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,291
I constantly ask myself
why she was killed.

177
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:24,375
Why someone would want her dead?
It doesn't make sense.

178
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,416
It's silly, right?
I've spent so much time

179
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,333
chasing her and I don't even
know what she looks like.

180
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,166
[HITSUGI]
I don't think it's silly at all.

181
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,958
They were people that
you care about, right?

182
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,333
Yeah. I only had the opportunity
to meet her daughter once,

183
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,958
but she seemed nice.

184
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,458
[HITSUGI]
Huh? You only met her once?

185
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,125
So you're doing all of this
after only one meeting?

186
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,500
[CHITARU laughs]

187
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,916
[HITSUGI] You have a
genuinely kind heart, Chitaru.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,458
[CHITARU]
I don't know about that.

189
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,958
I just want to see my
mentor smile once more.

190
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,166
You know, you told me yesterday

191
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,208
that you wanted to help me,
but you don't have to do that.

192
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:15,291
I want you to stay innocent,
to stay away from that darkness.

193
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
I think I can handle it.

194
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,083
I know that I may seem like
it but I'm not that weak.

195
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,833
[CHITARU]
If you say so.

196
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,583
Testing.

197
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

198
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,958
Class Black's production of
Romeo and Juliet will now begin.

199
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,208
I hope you all have your
handkerchiefs at the ready.

200
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,416
Turn off your cell
phones and no talking.

201
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,083
If anyone causes
a disturbance...

202
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,791
Then it's your own fault
if you wind up dead.

203
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,250
[STUDENT 6D] That was a
really funny announcement.

204
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,666
Alright, Inukai. Now that's
how you get their attention.

205
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,625
[CHITARU] How're you feeling?
Starting to get nervous?

206
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,291
[HARU]
Yeah. I am.

207

Good night, mistress.

210
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,458
[HITSUGI]
Thank you, and good night.

211

Oh, day and night,

[CHITARU]
O, my most desired love.

214
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,250
Upon the wings of night
have I flown here this evening,

215
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,208
only to fall beneath the
weight of my passion for you.

The moon, so beautiful
this night,

00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,500
but oh, lovely moon goddess,
your true nature is cruel.

[TOKAKU] If she's
planning to attack today,

219
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
that leaves less than ten hours.

[TOKAKU gasps]

221
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,375
[HITSUGI] I feel like
a fool in some ways.

222
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,625
I speak to you
from this balcony,

223
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,666
even though I know...

224
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,666
[HARU]
Is something wrong?

225
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,916
It's coated in poison.

What man are you,
hidden by night?

There's poison
all over the handle.

to go through with it.

Oh. Romeo, my Romeo.

O tell me, why do you
have to be Romeo?

[CHITARU] If that is truly
the wish you ask of me,

then no longer am I Romeo.

to sit there and tell me

that you didn't do
this to protect Haru?

The hospital tests said
it was a poison needle

that brought her down.

Ah. I'm far more terrified

310
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,291
And how could you know
what she's been through?

311
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,666
Damn!

312
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,166
[CHITARU]
She's a heartless poisoner!

313
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,541
And I won't let her
get away with it!

314
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,125
[TOKAKU]
Poisoner?

315
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,333
[CHITARU]

316
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,500
[CHITARU] I figured it out
when Kenmochi was poisoned.

317
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,833
I know she did it!

318
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,958
No, that's impossible.
Kirigaya poisoned Shiena.

319
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,833
What was that?

320
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,750
[CHITARU]
Why should I believe you?

321
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,916
[TOKAKU]
Because I was there.

322
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,291
I saw it with my
own eyes. It was her!

323
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,333
[CHITARU]
That's a lie!

324
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,583
[HITSUGI]
I'm afraid it's true.

325
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,916
[CHITARU gasps]
Kirigaya?

326
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,708
I'm sorry,
but Angel's Trumpet is me.

327
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,291
Why are you telling me this?

328
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,166
My plan didn't
work as I'd hoped.

329
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,875
But it was my intention
for Haru to die on the stage,

330
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,500
exactly as her character
dies in the play.

331
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,208
So then, you're the one
who poisoned the sword?

332
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,791
I wish I could deny it.

333
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,750
But I'm telling you because
there's just no reason

334
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,708
for you to be risking
your life fighting Azuma.

335
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
Kirigaya...

336
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,041
[HITSUGI]
We should go back now.

337
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,416
I think we've kept the
audience waiting long enough.

338
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,166
[NIO]
Once you consume this potion,

339
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
you will appear dead
to the world, but...

340
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,500
[HITSUGI]
I care not.

341
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,458
I beg of you,
give me this potion, friar.

342
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,750
[HARU] I never would have
guessed that they were enemies.

343
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you think they can reconcile?

344
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:23,291
I sincerely doubt it.
After all, they're both killers.

345
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,708
[NIO] In two and 40 hours,
you will awaken fully refreshed

346
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,500
as if rising from a
deep and pleasant sleep.

347
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,625
I-I have to.

348
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,208
I will carry out my mission.

349
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,458
[HITSUGI]
Romeo, I drink this for you.

350
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,541
[STUDENTS gasping]

351
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,750
Oh Romeo!

00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,333
[BOTH gasp]

353
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,416
[STUDENT 6J]
So dreamy!

354
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,333
[CHITARU]
I found your poison.

355
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,333
[HITSUGI]
Life seems to be against us.

356
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,041
We can never be
anything but enemies.

357
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,833
Our fates just won't allow it.

358
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,333
Very well. I have
no other choice!

359

What the--?

362
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:43,083
I don't want to do this,
but it's my duty.

363
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,875
This is just as it should be.

364
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,875
It's okay.

365
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,291

[HITSUGI grunts]

367
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,916
[CHITARU]
No, please. Hitsugi...

368
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,875
[NIO] You were Juliet's
final wish, Romeo.

369
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,791
She told me that when
everything was said and done,

370
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,333
the only thing she wanted
was to leave here with you.

371
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,208
Living her life with you.

372
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,250
That is what this
child truly wished for.

373
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,208
[CHITARU]
No.

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,375
I'm sorry that I
never understood you.

375
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,458
That I only saw
what I wanted to see.

376
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,750

[STUDENT 6L]
That was so much fun, huh?

380
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,041
[STUDENT 6M] That was so sad,
I was totally crying.

381
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,166
[STUDENT 6N] They almost had me
convinced that they really died.

382
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,958
[HARU whimpers]

383
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,291
[KAIBA] Did you know
there are official rules

384
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,958
to the split-the-watermelon
game? I hear it even covers

385
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,833
who cleans up at the end.

386
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,791
Seriously? That reminds
me of the saying

387
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,458
"the field trip isn't
over until you get home".

388
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,583
While we're on the subject.
I could go for some watermelon.
