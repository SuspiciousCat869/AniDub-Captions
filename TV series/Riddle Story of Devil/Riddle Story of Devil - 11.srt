1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,125
[MIZOROGI] When it comes
to creatures that naturally

2
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,166
form highly organized societies,

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,916
there's no better
example than bees.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,458
Take the queen bee.

5
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,916
She uses what's known
as the primer pheromone,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,958
a pheromone that
only she produces,

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:49,291
in order to assume leadership
of the worker bees.

8
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,458
This shuts off their
reproductive functions

9
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,833
and lets her assign them tasks
like defending the hive.

10
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,458
In order to protect the hive
from their enemies,

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,791
honeybee workers will
go so far as to endanger

12
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,666
their own lives
during an attack.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,333
Of course, they take some losses
as a result. But that sacrifice

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,458
is part of their instinct
to protect the group.

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,208
[MIZOROGI sighs]

16
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,625
[HARU]
Mr. Mizorogi?

17
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,541
[MIZOROGI gasps]
Oh, sorry.

18
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,000
I just got lost
in thought there.

19
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,583
[MIZOROGI] I want you all
to know you can count on me.

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,583
I'll teach this class
to the very end.

21
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,208
That's the one
promise I can make

22
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:30,541
as your homeroom teacher.
It's my job and I will do it.

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,416
[NIO] I just can't help but
feel bad for everything

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,625
we've put Mr. Mizorogi through.

25
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:46,125
I hope he gets to teach a normal
class next time, don't you?

26
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,666
[NIO] But forget about
that for a moment.

27
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,916
This is an
official announcement.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,250
Tonight at midnight,
meet me in the tower

29
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:02,750
in classroom 1908 for the
real Class Black orientation.

30
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,625
If you wanna know the truth
about why we're all here,

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,041
I suggest you participate.

32
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,041
[HARU gasps]

33
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,500
[TOKAKU gasps]

34
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,875
Oh, but then again.

35
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,125
You already know the reason,
don't you, Haru?

36
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,458
That's all! This announcement
brought to you by Nio Hashiri!

37
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,500
Hey, um, Tokaku?

38
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,750
[TOKAKU]
What is it?

39
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,750
[HARU] Well, you see,
you know that stuff

40
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,791
we were talking
about the other day?

41
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,041
What Sumireko said?

42
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,041
[TOKAKU] What about all
those things Hanabusa said?

43
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,583
The queen bee? What was
she talking about?

44
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,500
[NIO]
What the hell are you thinking?

45
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,125
Talking about that
stuff in the open?

46
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,291
[NIO] I said everything will be
explained tonight, didn't I?

47
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,583
Try exercising a
little bit of patience.

48
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,625
There's no point
in spoiling the fun.

49
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,666
You've won already.

50
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,416
We've won?

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,625
[NIO] Did you forget that
you beat everyone else?

52
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,333
Tokaku sure did
risk her life enough.

53
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,708
I'm done eating.

54
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
[TOKAKU]
Take all the time you need.

55
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,166
There's nobody
left to attack you.

56
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,333
[SUMIREKO laughs]
How sad.

57
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,000
You don't even realize that's
the power of the queen bee.

58
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,750
[TOKAKU]
The queen bee?

59
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,833
The worker bee and the rabbit?

60
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,208
What the two have in common
is that they are willing

61
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,291
to give up their lives
to protect the leader.

62
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,916
[TOKAKU] She was just
messing with my head.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,958
So why the hell am I
letting it get to me?

64
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,875
[NIO] Well then.
I'm sure the chairperson

65
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,958
will put a nice,
pretty bow on all this.

66
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,750
And you're related
to her, aren't you?

67
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,166
[HARU] I've never
actually met her before.

68
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,875
In fact, I've had
almost no contact

69
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,666
with other members of our clan.

70
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,041
All told, my life
has been pretty normal.

71
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,541
Girl, don't give me that!
There's nothing normal

72
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,541
about living with
a target on your back.

73
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,333
[HARU gasps]

74
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,708
[NIO]
Sorry, that was going too far.

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,000
[HARU]
All you did was say the truth.

76
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,875
I guess I'm not.

77
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,750
[NIO]
But you could be normal.

78
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,500
Because unlike us...

79
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,666
You don't actually
belong in here.

80
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,208
You belong out there in
the world of broad daylight.

81
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,041
[HARU]
Hey, Tokaku!

82
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,166
Sorry I'm running a little late.

83
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,708
[TOKAKU]
Come on.

84
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,375
[NIO] Now that the two of
you are here we can begin

85
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,416
the true orientation!

86
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,875
There's just one more
thing before we dig in.

87
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,750
A word from the
school chairperson,

88
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,666
Miss Meichi Yuri,
the sponsor of Class Black!

89
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,083
[BOTH grunt]

90
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,041
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Azuma and Miss Ichinose.

91
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:26,208
I'm the chairperson
of Myojo. Call me Yuri.

92
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,833
[CHAIRPERSON]
You've both done a brilliant job

93
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,416
of overcoming Class Black.

94
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,458
So please accept this brief but
sincere offer of felicitation.

95
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,791
Congratulations.

96
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,291
Thank you, that's
very kind of you.

97
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,333
That's enough already.

98
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,833
[TOKAKU]
You're gonna explain, right?

99
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,416
What Class Black
is actually about?

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,208
Why did you assemble
all of us at this school?

101
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,958
And why did you put us
through this hellish game?

102
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,958
Just who are you people
and what do you want?

103
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,458
[CHAIRPERSON] Do you know
what a ritual initiation is?

104
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,041
It's a test to measure
the worth of an individual.

105
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,166
They're typically put
through this grueling ordeal

106
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
once they reach a certain age.

107
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,916
Our clan, specifically, requires
the girls of our lineage

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,500
to undergo such a trial
when they turn 15 years old.

109
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,083
It's rather apparent
what you're thinking.

110
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,041
And you're right, Miss Azuma.

111
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,250
The sole purpose
of Class Black was not

112
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,666
to murder Haru as you were told.

113
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,833
No, in actuality, the sole
purpose was to pit Haru

114
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,375
against 12 assassins to see
if she could survive.

115
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,958
[TOKAKU gasps]

116
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,958
It was all devised
to see if Haru

117
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,625
has what it takes to carry
the torch, to lead our clan.

118
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,041
[TOKAKU]
Your clan?

119
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,208
[CHAIRPERSON]
Yes.

120
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
A vast network of
families whose lineages

121
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,291
trace back to one bloodline.

122
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,791
[CHAIRPERSON] We reside in
all corners of the world,

123
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,750
and we are responsible
for everything that happens.

124
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,041
In politics, in finance,
military affairs,

125
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,416
education, culture, the arts.

126
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,875
Our hand guides
the course of history,

127
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,375
manipulating all matters
of power and influence.

128
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,166
And the one who unifies
our clan is the Primer.

129
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,333
She possesses a rare trait,
a kind of magnetism,

130
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,791
that's unique to
the women of our clan.

131
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,750
Whether they're
willfully acting upon it,

132
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,583
or it's an unintentional
and unconscious action,

133
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,541
these women draw people
to them only to charm them,

134
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,083
control them,
and manipulate them.

135
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,166
The more danger a Primer faces,

136
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,416
the stronger this
influence becomes.

137
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,375
And the more refined it grows.

138
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,375
And that's why the girls of our
clan are continually targeted

139
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,833
for death from the very
moment they are born.

140
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,583
[TOKAKU gasps]

141
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,666
[CHAIRPERSON] Haru has proven
herself to possess great power,

142
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,125
and she beautifully passed
the initiation of Class Black.

143
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,625
She's certain to become
an ideal Primer.

144
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,458
[TOKAKU]
She manipulates people?

145
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,875
[CHAIRPERSON]
Correct.

146
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
Although I couldn't honestly
say whether she did it

147
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,791
intentionally or not with you.

148
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
[CHAIRPERSON]
So that moment.

149
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
When you chose to step
forward and declare yourself

150
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,916
as Haru's guardian?

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,375
That was wholly
unsurprising to us.

152
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,083
It was actually
somewhat expected.

153
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,416
[TOKAKU gasps]

154
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,416
You're wrong!

155
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Hm?

156
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,166
I don't have any
kind of powers at all!

157
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,125
I came here 'cause they
said if I went through this,

158
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,583
it would be all over!

159
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,541
They said I would
get to live a normal life!

160
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,291
So all this, this stuff
about controlling people,

161
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,625
it's just not possible!

162
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,750
Then tell me,
if you genuinely lack

163
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,500
these powers of persuasion,
how were you able to survive

164
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,083
against 12 highly trained
and motivated assassins?

165
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,083
You can't deny that many
people have died for you.

166
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,833
Willingly sacrificing their
lives in exchange for yours.

167
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,625
The people at the orphanage
who raised you as a child.

168
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,000
The hospital staff.

169
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,250
Close neighbors.

170
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,875
And of course your family.

171
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,333
[HARU gasps]

172
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,791
And I know they were
all happy to do it.

173
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,666
Giving up their lives for you
was a privilege to each of them.

174
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,416
No! Stop!

175
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,541
[CHAIRPERSON] You stand here
today after every attempt

176
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,291
that's been made on your life.

177
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,916
What further proof do you
need that you're special?

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,583
[HARU]
Stop saying that!

179
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,416
That's not me!
I'm not like that!

180
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,583
[NIO]
Wait, Haru!

181
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,458
[CHAIRPERSON]
No, Nio, leave her be.

182
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,500
She needs some time alone
to think things through.

183
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,916
Deep down, I'm sure
that she knows we're right.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,291
As for you, Miss Azuma.

185
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,916
What is it that you most
desire in this world?

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,958
Desire?

187
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,750
[CHAIRPERSON] Haru wouldn't
have won without you

188
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,250
clearing the path for her.

189
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,333
So we acknowledge you as a
winner of Class Black as well.

190
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,083
Simply name your reward
and I'll have it prepared.

191
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,875
Congratulations.

192
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,125
There's no need to give
me an answer now.

193
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,041
You have plenty
of time to decide,

194
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,625
but make sure you
think it over carefully.

195
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,666
[NIO]
There you have it.

196
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,750
That concludes the
orientation. Thank you.

197
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
[HARU]
I'd heard all the stories.

198
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,208
I knew that special
people like that existed,

199
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,125
but I never thought
it would have anything

200
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,166
to do with me.

201
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,833
I mean, even in our clan,
my family was always

202
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,625
on the outskirts, like we
didn't even matter to anyone.

203
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,916
So there's just no way
that I could ever

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
have the ability
to rule the clan.

205
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:45,208
It's impossible. At least,
that's what I thought.

206
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,166
[TOKAKU]
You heard her.

207
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,833
She said the Primer
can exert itself

208
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,583
without you even
being conscious of it.

209
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,250
And it only gets stronger
the more danger you're in.

210
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,250
So...

211
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,458
Do you...

212
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,291
Are you saying that I
manipulated everyone

213
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,333
in Class Black to go easy
on me? That's ridiculous!

214
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,916
[TOKAKU] You didn't have
to manipulate everyone.

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,958
You just need control over one
person to make her protect you.

216
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,625
[HARU gasps]

217
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
If you don't want
me to believe that,

218
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,208
then prove me wrong.

219
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,875
But I...

220
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,250
I just didn't want you...

221
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,208
I just couldn't stand the
idea of us being enemies.

222
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,791
That's all.

223
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,041
[TOKAKU] So basically, you're
saying that you can't prove it?

224
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,166
[HARU]
Tokaku!

225
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,083
[KAIBA] I've been given the
details of what transpired.

226
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166
A job well done.

227
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,708
I suppose this calls
for a celebration.

228
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,333
Congratulations on
winning Class Black.

229
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,916
[TOKAKU]
You knew, didn't you?

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
[KAIBA]
Hm?

231
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,250
[TOKAKU]
The true purpose of Class Black.

232
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,583
About the clan behind it
and about the Primer.

233
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,041
[KAIBA laughs]
Ah, Tokaku.

234
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,958
What's the point of
even asking me that?

235
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,166
[TOKAKU gasps]

236
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,166
If I were to tell you,
here and now.

237
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,083
"Why yes, I knew from
the very beginning".

238
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,750
What difference would that make?
What would it change for you?

239
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,708
[KAIBA]
Aw, man.

240
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,875
This is why I hate
dealing with kids.

241
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,208
Just hurry and wise up already.

242
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,875
You know all those riddles
I kept sending you?

243
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,875
You do realize there's no
correct answer to them, right?

244
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,000
[TOKAKU gasps]

245
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,166
The only answers
that matter, Tokaku,

246
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,666
are the ones that
come from inside you.

247
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,416
So dig 'em up and
take a close look.

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,916
Strain your fledgling brain
and figure out who you are.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,166
Oh, don't get me wrong,

250
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,291
I am still gonna
grade you on them.

251
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,041
Just 'cuz you're in
Class Black doesn't mean

252
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,625
I'm not your teacher.

253
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,625
[knocking]

254
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,791
What do you want?
You know how late it is?

255
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,541
I need to speak with Yuri.

256
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,500
And in person.

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,041
[KOUKO]
I want out! I can't take it!

258
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,458
I don't want this anymore!

259
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,416
[SUZU] His birthday
has come once again...

260
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,916
[CHITARU] I'm sorry that
I never understood you,

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,291
that I only saw what
I wanted to see.

262
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,416
[HARUKI] There's only one way
out of this hellish game

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,083
for her, and that's to die.

264
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,125
[ISUKE] You realize
this is all your fault.

265
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,875
If you'd been able
to kill me before,

266
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,250
we wouldn't even be
in this situation.

267
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:00,500
[HARU sobbing]
Tokaku! Tokaku! Tokaku!

268
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,666
[TOKAKU]
I can't figure out why I did it.

269
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,916
Did I genuinely
want to protect Haru

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,333
or was she controlling me?

271
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,708
How can I prove
the real reason?

272
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,541
This is just another riddle.

273
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,958
Another damn riddle that
no one has the answer to.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,916
[TOKAKU]
Tch!

275
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,000
[HARU] I've made up my mind
and I'm not joining the clan.

276
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,250
I know for a fact that
I don't have the power

277
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,500
to control people.

278
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,666
The only thing I want
is to live a normal life

279
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,083
away from all of this killing,

280
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,083
just like my family wanted
for me before they died.

281
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,791
[CHAIRPERSON] And are you
certain that that's your answer?

282
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, I am.

283
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Do you honestly believe
that all of the people

284
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,041
who sacrificed themselves
so you could live

285
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,958
would be content
with that decision?

286
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,833
[HARU gasps]
Don't ask me that.

287
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,166
[CHAIRPERSON]
Haru, if you'll indulge me,

288
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,875
there's something
I feel you should see.

289
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,916
Please, Nio. You know
what I'm referring to.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,250
Would you show
Haru the way there?

291
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,875
[HARU]
This goes really deep.

292
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,583
[NIO]
You'll understand why.

293
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,416
Only members of the clan
can enter past this point.

294
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,333
[NIO]
This is the cemetery.

295
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,541
Each and every person
enshrined here has given

296
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,666
their life in
deference to the clan.

297
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,833
Of course, it's not like there
are bones or bodies buried here.

298
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,291
This is only a
cemetery of names.

299
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,583
Our departed are engraved
here so that their loyalty

300
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,458
and sacrifice will
never be forgotten.

301
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,375
This was originally
an actual burial ground.

302
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,750
Myojo Private School
was later built in its place.

303
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,833
But why?

304
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,166
The one thing you can
always find in a school

305
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,500
is the laughter of children.

306
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,083
To console the souls of
the dead with the voices

307
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,666
of children living
on into the future.

308
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,041
"As our gift to you,
we will never cry.

309
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,833
Behold. Unto eternity.

310
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,458
As we carry on to
prevail in this world."

311
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,750
[NIO]
I know how lonely it must be.

312
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,666
Having been born with
a power such as yours,

313
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,500
this kind of life is
the only choice you have.

314
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,708
Haru, I get it.

315
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,958
I was all alone
in this world too.

316
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,333
Though someone cared
enough to save me.

317
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,541
And that was the chairperson.

318
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,541
Wait, Yuri did?

319
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,875
It's not uncommon for
the clan to use its power

320
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,000
to save people as well.
Please remember that, Haru.

321
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,333
Okay?

322
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,000
[NIO] Take some time to think
things over by yourself.

323
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,958
I'll come find you
in a little while.

324
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,750
[HARU gasps]

325
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:13,500
[HARU]
Dad. Mom. Big brother. Wataru.

326
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,375
[HARU'S FAMILY laughing]

327
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,791
[HARU'S FAMILY]
Happy birthday, Haru!

328
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,500
[YOUNG HARU]
Thank you!

329
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,708
[HARU'S MOTHER]
No, thank you for being born!

330
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,583
Haru, we couldn't
be more fortunate

331
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,916
to have you in our lives.

332
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,416
[YOUNG HARU giggling]

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,916
[HARU]
Mom, I miss you.

334
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,791
Did you give your life
to protect me

335
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:45,958
because you really loved me?
Or was it because I made you?

336
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,500
[HARU sobbing]

337
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,916
[HARU gasps]

338
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,750
Is everything okay?

339
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,083
[TOKAKU]
I've been doing some thinking.

340
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,666
Wondering if there's
a reason you and I met,

341
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,583
and what that reason could be.

342
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,583
Back before I met you,
I simply followed

343
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,708
whatever order I was given.

344
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,791
I was nothing more
than a puppet.

345
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,958
Things I cared about,
a purpose in life,

346
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,916
I didn't have that stuff.

347
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,833
And I wasn't even aware of the
fact that I didn't have them.

348
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,958
But then I met you.
And you showed them to me.

349
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,625
You taught me how
to actually live.

350
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:48,791
It's as if every day of my life
has been leading me to this day,

351
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,708
to this moment,
right here with you.

352
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,833
[HARU]
Tokaku...

353
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,833
So thank you, Haru.

354
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:00,750
Thank you for everything, I am
truly fortunate to have met you.

355
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,083
[HARU sobs]

356
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,625
But that's the reason why...

357
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,375
...I have no choice
but to do this.

358
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,208
[HARU gasps]

359
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,333
[KAIBA]
You finally get it, right?

360
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,416
Everything that comes out of
my mouth is a load of bullshit.

361
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,000
And there are
no correct answers.

362
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,916
So go ahead! Wield your
blade as you see fit.

363
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,541
That seems to be the only answer

364
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,291
you've arrived at
on your own in Class Black.
