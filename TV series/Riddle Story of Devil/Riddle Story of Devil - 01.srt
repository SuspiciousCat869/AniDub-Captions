It's kill or be killed!

No target will just lie down
and let you assassinate them!

They will fight for their

[KAIBA]
Year 10. Class Black.

25
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,250
You were practically
raised in this dark,

26
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,583
little world of ours, so you
must have at least heard of it.

27
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,500
You'll soon be transferred
to Class Black. Your objective

28
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,250
is to kill the designated
target before anyone else.

29
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,250
The target will be
another high school girl

chosen for ulterior reasons.
As for the rest

of your carefully
handpicked classmates...

...they'll also be assassins!

Their backgrounds run the gamut.

34
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,166
Some are trained
professionals like yourself,

35
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,041
some of them just find murder
to be an act of pleasure.

I have nothing to distract me.

off the top of your head?

[KAIBA] Bzzz! Wrong answer!

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,958
Torment? You're one
morbid bitch, huh?

Is that the only
reason you're calling?

[KAIBA]
No.

52
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,125
Y'know how I told you
you're getting transferred

'cuz you're the
most apt student?

Well, that was
a load of bullshit.

55
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,875
I simply chose the most
psychologically damaged

a damn to anyone.

[TOKAKU]
Big surprise. And I don't care.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,666
So will you kill to live?
Or let live and die?

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,791
Those are two of your options.

attempt to let live and live.

me anything new.

What? 40 years old?
That's like a senior citizen.

117
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,875
40 is nowhere even near old.
Maybe I should kill you.

Oh, and the name Tokaku?

It means an impossible thing.

you don't ask me later.

I'll do it later, in the dark.

135
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,500
[MIZOROGI]
Hm?

136
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,750
[MAHIRU]
I only...

137
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,708
...do things once
the sun goes down.

138
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,833
Don't make me say it again.

139
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,250
Uh, moving on.

140
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,708
We've got one more.

141
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,125
Me! I'm student number 13.

142
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,333
Haru Ichinose.

143
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sure we'll all get along.

144
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,375
[TOKAKU]
Haru Ichinose...

145
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,000
[HARU] Actually, I thought it
might be nice to have a token

146
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,458
of our new acquaintance.

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,125
So I made cellphone
straps for everyone.

148
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,791
I hope you all like them!

149
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,625
Uh. Well thanks, man.

150
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,791
Wow. That's desperate.

151
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
[MIZOROGI]
Alright.

152
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,833
We need to discuss the dormitory
that you'll all be living in.

153
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,833
If you're okay with it,
student number 1,

154
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,250
I figured it'd be easiest
to make you dorm rep,

155
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,500
temporarily, anyway.

156
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,958
[TOKAKU]
I don't want this thing.

157
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,750

00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,166
And it's not just
pretty, y'know.

161
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,625
It's got fun stories.

162
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,375
Like about how the workers
suffered nonstop accidents

163
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,000
while constructing the school.

164
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,791
Or how they're used
to be a cemetery here,

165
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,875
but they just built
on top of it.

166
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,833
Y'see, I've always gone
here so I'm in the know.

167
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,416
What do you say we team up?

168
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,250
I've got no problem
being your underling.

169
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,416
[TOKAKU] No thanks.
Has the target been confirmed?

170
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,416
[NIO] It ain't you, sister,
that much I know for sure.

171
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,125
You got the stink
of trouble all over.

172
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,291
[TOKAKU]
You think so?

173
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,083
The most likely target
is Haru Ichinose.

174
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,333
She smells like oblivious prey.

175
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,083
[NIO] Yeah, but I
don't think you wanna

176
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,083
let your guard down around her.

177
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,333
It's gotta be a GPS
or a listening device.

178
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,958
Not foolin' me.

179
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,791
[NIO gasps]

180
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,291
[TOKAKU]
It's not a big deal, really.

181
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,125
I don't think it's anything
more than a cellphone strap.

182
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,833
[TOKAKU]
That's weird. Why do I care?

183
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,083
It's wasteful to just
toss it like that.

184
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,958
You obviously don't want it,
so I'll keep it for myself.

185
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,083
[TOKAKU] I didn't even want
the one she gave me,

186
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,000
and now I've got two.

187
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,916
[ISUKE]
I don't want that crap either.

188
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,875
[NIO]
Dang, dude, you look scary!

189
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,333
[TOKAKU]
Take a look at her.

190
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,666
I'm not gonna hide
my true nature.

191
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,125
You see, I'm gonna
win this dumb class.

192
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,958
The target is clearly number 13.

193
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,625
Hm... You never can tell.

194
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,000
[HARU]
Uh. Do you...?

195
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,875
Yes, I love it. Thank you.
It makes me so happy.

196
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,083
Honestly.

197
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,916
Really? That makes
me happy, too!

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,708
[MAHIRU] It'll serve as
a relic. It's perfect.

199
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,750
[HARU]
Did you say a relic?

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,500
[SHINYA] A personal object of
someone exalted who's died.

201
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,541
[MAHIRU giggles]

202
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,500
[HARU]
Hey, Azuma! Remember me?

203
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,083
It turns out I'm your roommate!

204
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,041
Mind if I walk with you
on the way to the dorm?

205
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,083
[TOKAKU]
Yeah, sure. I don't mind.

206
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,375
[HARU]
Oh, awesome. Thank you!

207
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,791
This place is so sprawling
it's a little overwhelming.

208
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,291
Wow, you're kind of a
fast walker, aren't ya?

209
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,208
That's really cool
that you got selected

210
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,875
to be the temp dorm rep.

211
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,333
I'm jealous.

212
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,208
[HARU]
I'm gonna study with everyone!

213
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,708
It seems like a good way
to make friends with people.

214
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
I just wanna
enjoy life, ya know?

215
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,458
And I promise you this:
I'll graduate without fail.

216
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,250
You seem rather anxious
about that achievement.

217
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,166
Huh? Well, yeah.

218
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,916
[HARU] I haven't been to
much school before now.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,166
Some stuff happened
when I was younger.

220
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,208
Long story, but that's
why I'm happy to be here.

221
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,083
[TOKAKU] I can't figure out
what she smells like.

222
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,958
[HARU gasps]

223
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,458
[NIO]
What's up, Haru? Tokaku!

224
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,125
[HARU]
Miss Nio!

225
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,250
Just Nio. I'm not a teacher.

226
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,375
Y'know, Tokaku,
you sure are lucky

227
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,208
you're roommates
with Haru, here!

228
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,500
Don't do that.

229
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,000
Huh?

230
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,291
There's no reason that you
should address me so casually.

231
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,083
Call me Miss Azuma.

232
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,166
[NIO]
What? Are you serious?

233
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,041
Dead serious.

234
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,125
[TOKAKU]
There's something off about her.

235
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,291
She's got a putrid ocean stench.

236
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,791
Miss Tokaku!

237
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,625
[HARU]
Uh. Let's compromise!

238
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,500
How about Miss Tokaku?

239
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,208
You can do what you want.

240
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,125
[HARU]
Uh. Hey, wait up!

241
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,083
[NIO laughs]

242
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,375
[HARU]
Wow!

243
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,541
Amazing!

244
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,708
It's so spacious!
Like a nice hotel!

245
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,125
[HARU] Which bed do
you prefer, Miss Tokaku?

246
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,416
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

247
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,916
I just flopped right down.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,708
I'm fine with either.

249
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,375
Huh?

250
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,333
[TOKAKU] Those look like
scars from a dull blade.

251
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,625
Let me see.

252
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,833
No way! I mean--
They're not pretty to look at.

253
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,333
[TOKAKU]
Just lift up your skirt.

254
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,708
What? No, really,
I'd rather not.

255
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,833
They're just scars from a long
hospital stay after an accident.

256
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,666
Alright then.

257
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,583
[HARU sighs]

258
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,625
[HARU screams]

259
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,375
[HARU]
Okay. You're not very nice, huh?

260
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,166
And what's this?
Are you my roommate?

261
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Yeah, I'm Haruki Sagae.
Nice to meet ya.

262
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,500
Perfect timing.

263
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,625
Do you have any--

264
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,125
[ISUKE]
Mistress Isuke Inukai.

265
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,416
[HARUKI]
Right, sorry.

266
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,708
Now that's out of the way.

267
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,916
Ya got any nail
polish remover, Isuke?

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,208
I spaced out and forgot mine.

269
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,333
Oh, this is off to a bad start.
You're pissing me off.

270
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,666
I'd rather you call
me Mistress Isuke.

271
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,500
[HARUKI] Sure. Mistress.
You got that remover?

272
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,166
The paint on my nails has
been chipping like crazy.

273
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,375
[ISUKE]
Too bad for you.

274
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,125
I use gel polish. So no remover.

275
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,708
[HARUKI]
What? You really use gel polish?

276
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,458
[ISUKE gasps]

277
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,833
[HARUKI] I always heard
this stuff thins your nails.

278
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,291
Doesn't seem worth it to me.

279
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,750
But they sure
are pretty, though.

280
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,041
Hey. You do know
Isuke's a guys name right?

281
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,083
Yeah, but who cares?
I think it's a cool name.

282
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,875
[TOKAKU]
I guess...

283
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,458
I better go check
the other rooms, too.

284
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,916
Okay, I'm done,
the bath's all yours.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,625
What's that? The roll call?

286
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,750
I'll come with you.

287
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,333
[TOKAKU]
Not necessary.

288
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,166
[HARU] Roommates are supposed to
help each other with that stuff.

289
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,958
Not necessary.

290
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,208
[HARU humming]

291
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,791
Everyone from Class Black!

292
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,458
It's time for our
nightly roll call.

293
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,500
[HITSUGI]
Have a good night.

294
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,791
[HARU]
Thanks, you too.

295
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,708
Wait, are you in grade school?
What are you doing up here?

296
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,333
[HITSUGI]
Grade? I'm not...

297
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,333
[CHITARU] She's a transfer
student to Year 10,

298
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,625
Class Black, just like
the rest of us.

299
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,166
[HARU]
Oh, you're our classmates?

300
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,708
I'm sorry, nice to meet you!

301
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,125
[CHITARU] I'm student number
9 on that list of yours.

302
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,958
Chitaru Namatame.

303
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,916
[HITSUGI] I'm number 4.
My name's Hitsugi Kirigaya.

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,041
It's nice to meet
the two of you.

305
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,500
Hi, good evening.
Time for roll call.

306
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,833
[HARU grunts]

307
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,166
Hm?

308
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,416
[HARU]
Uh...

309
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,583
Jeez, sorry.

310
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,125
[TOKAKU]
I guess you've arrived.

311
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,250
I take it you're Saguy?

312
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,166
You already know who I am.

313
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,708
[TOKAKU]
Process of elimination.

314
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,333
You're not Inukai.

315
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,958
How perceptive. Mistress Isuke's
in the shower right now.

316
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,250
Now that seems like a sweet
little hand incapable

317
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,291
of doing anything bad.

318
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,333
[HARU] Well, yeah, I make a
point of not doing bad things.

319
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,458
Hungry? Ya want one?

320
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,125
I don't.

321
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,750
Don't be like that.
Go on and take 'em!

322
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,833
Whoa. Nice reflexes.

323
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,333
Uh. Haruki. It's rude
to throw food at people.

324
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,125
[HARUKI giggles]
Aren't you precious?

325
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,666
Right-handed, huh?

326
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,083
Who knows? I could
be left-handed.

327
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,625
Or maybe I'm ambidextrous.

328
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,250
[HARU]
I've got a question.

329
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,458
Why are you always so bristly?

330
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,958
Why don't you ever smile?

331
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,958
Try it.

332
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,833
Like this!

333
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,333
Your smell. It's so...

334
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,041
[HARU]
My smell? Do I stink?

335
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,041
Man! I just showered!

336
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,958
[TOKAKU]
No, that's not how I meant it.

337
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,791
It's this kind of dusty smell.

338
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,166
Makes me wanna sneeze.

339
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,708
[HARU]
Oh no!

340
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,250
[SHINYA]
What, you don't know that smell?

341
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,625
That particular smell?

342
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,291
That's what they call
the smell of sunny places.

343
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,833
Yo, the sun finally set
so I've come to do it.

344
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,208
[HARU]
Um, to do what?

345
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,291
[SHINYA]
To introduce myself, of course.

346
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,291
The name's Shinya Banba.

347
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,291
The daytime girl is Mahiru.

348
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,750
It's nice to meet you.

349
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,375
Not really.

350
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,541
[TOKAKU]
The smell of sunny places.

351
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:35,041
[SHINYA insane giggling]

352
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,166
[KAIBA]
Okay! Zip your lips, brats.

353
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,916
Talking is prohibited.

354
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,250
To put it simply,
people in different positions

355
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,125
don't understand each other.

356
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,500
Is that clear enough?
Why bother with them?

357
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,541
It's a waste of your damn time.

358
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,083
[KAIBA]
Look at it like this.

359
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,791
What's the point of
getting to know someone

360
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,791
if you're about to
put a bullet in them?

361
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
Trust me, there are
things in this world

362
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,750
you're better off not knowing.

363
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,500
[TOKAKU gasps]

364
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,625
Just look at this place.

365
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,125
She's about as messy as a boy.

366
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,875
Miss Tokaku. Please don't
end up hating me.

367
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,125
Even once you get to know me.

368
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,708
[TOKAKU]
Ichinose.

369
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,250
Uh, yeah?

370
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,833
[TOKAKU]
Got any idea how to solve this?

371
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,250
[HARU]
Is it like a riddle?

372
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,375
Are there any hints?

373
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,500
[TOKAKU]
No hints.

374
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,083
[HARU]
Hm...

375
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,250
Eh, never mind. Just forget it.

376
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,833
[HARU] Well, if I got to
decide my own answer.

377
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
I would say forgiveness.

378
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,791
[TOKAKU gasps]

379
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,416
[HARU] The world is full of
forgiveness. Isn't that nice?

380
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,208
[TOKAKU gasps]

381
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,666
[TOKAKU] But-- There's
no way. That can't be it.

382
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,958
[HARU]
Yeah, I figured.

383
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,916
I just meant that's the answer I
would want it to be, that's all.

384
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,916
[TOKAKU]
Is she? No...

385
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,083
No, that can't be right.

386
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,458
[CHAIRPERSON]
I'm dying to see how long

387
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,625
she can actually hold out.

388
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:53,333
12 bloodthirsty trained
assassins against sweet Haru.

389
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,291
Well, young lady...

390
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,083
I'm excited to see
what you've got in you.

391
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,041
[NIO] And there we go.
Finally time to get started.

392
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,583
[TOKAKU] And so, everything
would change today.

393
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,583
But of course,
I didn't know that yet.

394
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,041
[KAIBA]
Hello, I'm Mr. Kaiba.

395
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,541
I'm a teacher at
Private Academy 17.

396
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,125
Dice Man, Dice Teach,
that bastard with the dice,

397
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,375
call me whatever. Students
give teachers nicknames,

398
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,750
that's just what happens.

399
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,875
But not Tokaku, oh no.
She's not that sort of girl.
