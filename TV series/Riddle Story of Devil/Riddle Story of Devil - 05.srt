00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,916
Oh! You're going for the
curry again today, I see.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,250
You must really love that stuff.

159
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,250
No one's supposed to discuss
the history of other classmates.

160
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,291
Well, sure, but I'm
the class arbitrator.

161
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,166
[HARU]
She didn't say anything bad.

162
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,583
In the future, ask me directly
if you're curious about my past.

163
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,291
Just leave that
nobody out of it.

164
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:10,916
That's me!

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,583
Oh. Uh, so then...

166
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,208
What's your immediate
family like?

167
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,083
This sounds like a date.

168
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,625
Well I don't even know
what my father looks like.

169
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,708
And my mother...

170
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,125
She died right after I was born.

171
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,625
So I was raised
by my grandmother.

172
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,750
My other relatives are...

173
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
They're dead.

174
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,416
Uh, I'm sorry to--

175
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Really? What a co-inky dink!

176
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,708
My entire family's
dead or missing as well!

177
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,583
[TOKAKU] No one asked you.
[NIO] Okay.

178
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,416
[HARUKI]
Hey.

179
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,333
Texting the fam?

180
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,583
[TOKAKU]
Not quite.

181
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,541
[HARUKI]
Sorry I was a bitch last night.

182
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,500
I just had some
weird stuff on my mind

183
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,083
and I lashed out at you guys.

184
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,458
[TOKAKU]
Don't worry about it.

185
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,916
[HARUKI] Man, another
peaceful day out there, huh?

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,291
If life was fair,
Haru would be out there

187
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,541
with all those other kids.
And not just Haru.

188
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,458
It's not like any
of us are really here

189
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,416
because we want
to go through with it.

190
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,416
I chalk it up to crappy luck.

191
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,458
Honestly, Azuma.

192
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,125
Wouldn't you rather give Haru
the freedom that she deserves?

193
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,750
The freedom to get
away from all of this.

194
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,958
We can give her that, you know?

195
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,333
Breaking away from
the rules of Class Black.

196
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,333
Is that what you're suggesting?

197
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,583
10 o'clock tonight.

198
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,375
Let's meet here. We can
talk more about it then.

199
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,041
I'll be waiting.

200
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,000
[ISUKE]
My, my.

201
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,625
I think I just figured out
why you got into this game.

202
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,666
Well at least they're cute.

203
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,375
The logical thing to do
would be to kill them all.

204
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,125
I know you live
your life your way,

205
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
but that's how I'd handle it.

206
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,291
You're only wasting your
time worrying about them.

207
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,375
Life is too short
to care so much.

208
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,791
You just have to get rid
of what you don't need.

209
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,500
Free yourself from that burden.

210
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,000
Hm. I was only trying
to give some advice.

211
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,666
[HARUKI] The reward I got
for the first person I killed

212
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,708
was measly. A tableful
of smiles for my family.

213
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,708
And a little something for me.

214
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,208
A bottle of
baby pink nail polish.

215
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,500
I'd always wanted it,
even though I knew

216
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,500
it wouldn't suit me.

217
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,791
[NIO] No need to tell me
your reward, Haruki.

218
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,166
I was given the details when
you were invited to Class Black.

219
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,333
You want enough money to keep
your family well-fed for life.

220
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,375
That's the gist of it, right?

221
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,833
That's it.

222
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,833
There's one other thing I
wanna make sure of, though.

223
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,875
And that is?

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:40,041
[inaudible]

225
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,041
That won't be a problem.

226
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,708
Miss Tokaku? Are you in here?

227
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,083
Oh, there you are.

228
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,750
[HARU]
Haruki?

229
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,875
Hey, have you seen Miss Tokaku?

230
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,375
She left a note saying for
me to meet her in here.

231
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,041
[HARUKI]
She's not coming.

232
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,208
It's just us.

233
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,041
What?

234
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,416
But don't worry.
I'm here to set you free.

235
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,291
[HARU gasps]

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,500
[HARU panting]

237
00:15:54,583 --> 00:16:09,333
[HARU gasping]

238
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,833
[HARUKI grunts]
[HARU gasps]

239
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,041
[HARU coughs]

240
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,208
What a liar.

241
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,666
You were gonna
blow off our meeting

242
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,083
from the get-go, weren't you?

243
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,666
[TOKAKU]
You're one to talk.

244
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,291
[HARUKI] You got me there, but
I was still telling the truth.

245
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,041
I lured Haru here to
give her her freedom.

246
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,083
There's only one way
out of this hellish game

247
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,166
for her and that's to die.

248
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,500
[HARU weakly]
Miss Tokaku...

249
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Don't worry, I got this.

250
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,166
[HARUKI] You may be
an Azuma, but just in name.

251
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,250
As meek as you are?
You can't kill me!

252
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,666
[HARU] Be careful!
[TOKAKU] Don't move!

253
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,291
[HARUKI grunts]

254
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,625
Look out!

255
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,458
[HARU whimpers]

256
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,000
[TOKAKU]
That's all I needed.

257
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,625
Now I've got you.

258
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,833
[HARUKI grunts]

259
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:31,458
[BOTH grunting]

260
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,208
[HARUKI groans]

261
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,833
[HARUKI]
Ow... Dammit.

262
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,166
That was hard core.

263
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,333
Who'd you have to sacrifice
to get that strong,

264
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,500
you freakin' monster?

265
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,958
[TOKAKU]
Are we finished?

266
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,083
[HARUKI]
You've made our bad luck worse.

267
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,791
We both know there's no
backing down from this.

268
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,666
Not for you guys,
and not for me.

269
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,083
We can't escape this
no matter what we do.

270
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,875
[HARUKI] If we're ever gonna be
free then this is the only way.

271
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,125
Huh?

272
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,958
In other words...

273
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,375
...I win!

274
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,541
[TOKAKU gasps]

275
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,416
[HARU gasps]

276
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,875
That's it.

277
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,875
There's one other thing I
wanna make sure of, though.

278
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,750
And that is?

279
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,208
If I don't make it out
of this one, like I die,

280
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,291
my family will still
get the reward, correct?

281
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,583
[HARUKI] From now on, you'll
live with smiles on your faces.

282
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,291
Just like Haru.

283
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,375
[TOKAKU grunts]

284
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,750
[HARU]
How did we live?

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,625
[HARU]
Its Haruki's set.

286
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,750
[TOKAKU] It made a
pocket of space for us.

287
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,583
[TOKAKU]
Looks like no fatal injuries.

288
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,958
Thank goodness.

289
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,541
[HARUKI grunts]

290
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,250
Think you can stand up?

291
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,041
What is with you?

292
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:59,291
[HARUKI sighs]
Oh, jeez. I lost and I admit it.

293
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,458
I was trying to give us all
a clean death in one swoop.

294
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,916
Kinda botched
that one, didn't I?

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,125
We can't die yet.
Not that easy.

296
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,291
Because being alive?

297
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
It means that you've
been forgiven.

298
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,833
[HARU]
Forgiven to be here now.

299
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:22,166
[HARUKI sighs]
I swear, dying would be easier.

300
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,250
It's not like I
actually asked for this.

301
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,166
Life can be pretty
meddlesome, huh?

302
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,416
Well, it doesn't look like
I have much of a choice.

303
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
One way or another,
I guess I'm just gonna

304
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:40,333
have to keep at it somehow.
Aww, boy. Crap.

305
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,250
What's up with you?

306
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,125
That icy face of yours almost
looks relieved I'm not dead.

307
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,875
Well.

308
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,000
It looks like this means that
you can't die yet either.

309
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,375
So you keep at it too.
Hang in there, okay?

310
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,208
I miss our big sis.

311
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,916
I really hope she
comes home soon.

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,250
Me too.

313
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,916
[FUYUKA]
That makes three of us.

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,125
Having the family all here.
That's the best, isn't it?

315
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:26,458
No!

316
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,833
Do you still believe the world
is full of forgiveness?

317
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,791
After what you've just
been through with Haruki

318
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,666
and the rest of the class
trying to kill you,

319
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,250
think you'll be able
to forgive it all?

320
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,833
That's the thing about it.

321
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,833
Forgiveness is there for
those who commit crimes

322
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,083
and make mistakes.
And you can't just do it once.

323
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,666
We forgive as many
times as it takes.

324
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,625
[KAIBA] To be or not to be.
That is the question.

325
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,791
That's a famous line
from Hamlet, of course.

326
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,666
But they're putting on
Romeo and Juliet,

327
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,708
so you don't think
it's relevant?

328
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,333
Well don't get too giddy
about the festival.

329
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,958
You might get hurt.
