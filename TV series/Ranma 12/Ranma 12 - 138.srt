parcel's arrived for you.

HAPPOSAI: I'm on my way.

GIRL: Here you are, grandfather.

7
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:49,311
Hm, I wonder who sent it?

8
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,811
There doesn't seem to be
a return address on it.

9
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:52,744
Ha, hm, hm.

10
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:56,544
[gasp]

11
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,377
So, what's in the
box there, master?

12
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,377
[grunting]

13
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,344
Oh.

14
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:06,344
Hm.

15
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:06,944
Hm?

16
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,411
Oh, dear.

17
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,911
Hm.

18
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:10,977
Mind your manners.

19
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,411
Come on, master.

20
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,244
It's too much to ask of a man.

21
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,377
Let us see.

22
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,677
There are no secrets between us.

23
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:18,977
Father's right.

24
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,711
We'd be honored if you were
to tell us what's inside.

25
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,944
When I'm ready.

26
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,844
Ugh.

27
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:25,677
MAN: Stingy.

28
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,477
You're a tease.

29
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:31,277
What could have
gotten into him?

30
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:31,818
Yeah.

31
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,644

finally arrived.

[music playing]

34
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,011
Hey, what's going on?

35
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,677
What's gotten into Happosai?

36
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:01,677
How come he's locked
himself into his room?

37
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:03,511
A parcel came for
him, and it seems

38
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,711
to be something
pretty important.

39
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,344
An important parcel?

40
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,711
Wonder what it is?

41
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:12,811
I don't know, but the master
won't even talk to me about it.

42
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,811
He's been acting strange
ever since that mystery

43
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,311
package arrived here for him.

44
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:17,944
Listen, Tendo.

45
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:18,977
Hm?

46
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,277
I don't know about
you, but I'm getting

47
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,244
a bad feeling about this.

48
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:22,944
TENDO: You are?

49
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,177
Well, so am I.

50
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:27,211
It's probably something
sick the old freak ordered.

51
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,311
HAPPOSAI: Ranma?

52
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,377
Huh?

53
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:29,918
Huh?

00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:34,711
Grandfather?

55
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,111
My friends, the Ogre
Festival of the Dark

56
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,411
will be held before too long.

[gasp]

58
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:46,811
What?

59
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:47,877
Ogre Festival of the Dark?

60
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,577
It sounds so scary.

61
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:53,744
Take a look at this.

62
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:55,511
Oh, that was in the box.

63
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,711
HAPPOSAI: Precisely.

64
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,744
This is what was in the
parcel I received earlier.

65
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:02,777
Huh?

66
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:03,318
Ugh.

67
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:03,844
It's hard.

68
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,411
What's in it?

69
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,511
Get your teeth off of it.

70
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:07,477
Uh, uh, uh.

71
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,111
It's the festival's
Corpus Christi

72
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,911
that's been handed
down over generations.

73
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,544
BOTH: Corpus Christi?

74
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:16,977
Ranma, let's see.

75
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:19,411
Just looks like an
old tin can to me.

76
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,811
On the contrary.

77
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,511
The Ogre Festival
of the Dark has

78
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:25,644
been celebrated for over a
thousand years among masters

79
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,444
of the martial arts.

80
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:30,911
Only a select few
are able to attend.

81
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:31,844
[grunting]

82
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,777
And the one who
successfully fights his way

83
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,444
through to the end of the
festival is cloaked in glory.

84
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:44,944
This festival is like a gateway
for those aiming to become

85
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:48,077
serious martial artists.

86
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:50,277
Do you know about
this stuff, dad?

87
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,644
No, I have to say,
it's news to me.

88
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,777
I'm almost afraid to ask,
what happens to all the losers

89
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,244
in the festival?

90
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,944
It's the end of
life as they know it.

91
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:00,811
[gulp]

92
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,211
Huh?

93
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,077
[scream]

94
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,411
HAPPOSAI: And their
long-cherished dream

95
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:10,144
of becoming a martial
arts master is finished.

96
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,444
Imagine the anguish
of a martial artist

97
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:16,011
who sees his dream shattered
before his very eyes.

98
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:19,244
I'm sure you two can at
least sympathize with him.

99
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:23,777
Well, what kind of match is it?

100
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:25,277
What kind?

101
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:28,611
The rules are very
straightforward.

102
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,077
Whoever is the ogre
must protect the Corpus

103
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,277
Christi from the opponent.

104
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,877
And who would this opponent be?

105
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,211
HAPPOSAI: All those who
arrange the festival.

106
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:41,711
But they never actually
reveal themselves.

107
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:45,144
In other words, all the
opponents are invisible?

108
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,644
Uh-huh.

109
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,444
Oh, that reminds
me of a game we used

110
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,811
to play when we were little.

111
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:50,577
Remember?

112
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:52,177
The one with the tin can.

113
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,511
Hm?

114
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:56,611
Oh, you mean kick the can?

115
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,744
That's the one.

116
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:00,811
Whoever's it is the ogre.

117
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:01,711
Huh?

118
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,211
You don't mean?

119
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,977
Are you suggesting that I
go and play kick the can?

120
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:07,877
[chuckles]

121
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:10,711
Too afraid?

122
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,252
Hm.

123
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,211
No.

124
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,844
I'll give this contest a shot.

125
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:22,711

Oh my, look at all the dust.

129
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:35,377
Ranma and grandfather certainly
are getting rough up there.

130
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:36,577
I don't know, you guys.

131
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,777
Don't you think Happosai
is going at it lot harder

132
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:40,144
than usual this time?

133
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:42,677
Especially considering that
Ranma's practicing with him.

134
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,577
But it is just kick
the can, after all.

135
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,444
How long could that be fun for?

136
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,877
Think they'll get bored?

137
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:51,844
[panting]

138
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,311
[music playing]

139
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,344
That wasn't too shabby
for a little warm up,

140
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:05,544
but now we're going to
start some real training.

141
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,244
You must be mentally
prepared with a focused mind.

142
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,277
Yeah, focused mind,
sure, whatever.

143
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:11,977
Now just tell me where I start.

144
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,244
First, we'll start
off with the road work.

145
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,377
What?

146
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,111
You don't mean I have
to do basic training?

147
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,411
Enough of that lip.

148
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:20,677
You got to build up
your stamina first.

149
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:23,311
You'll never win if you
don't have any stamina.

150
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:24,511
Got it?

151
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,811
Move out.

152
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,444
RANMA: Quit busting
my butt, I'm going.

153
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:31,211
[panting]

154
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:37,111
Huh?

155
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,077
[clatter]

156
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:42,577
He's close by.

157
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,544
Ah!

158
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:47,444
Awh!

159
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:47,985
Hm?

160
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,111
That old ninja trick.

161
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,111
[music playing]

162
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,577
Hey, that's your
firecracker trick.

163
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:02,577
[shouting]

164
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,477
Maybe I should rethink
this training thing.

165
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,477
Huh?

166
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,444
I should have known!

167
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:14,985
Ah.

168
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:23,944
Not bad at all, for
a freaky old man.

169
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:24,944
[music playing]

170
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:26,452
Wha?

171
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:30,877
[shouting]

172
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,677
Ahh!

173
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:49,218
Ahh!

174
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:56,577
[whimpering]

00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,544
[birdsong]

176
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,344
Ah.

177
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:04,311
Oh, dear.

178
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,211
And we've only just
gotten started.

179
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,477
This just won't do at all.

180
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,711
GIRL: Poor Ranma.

181
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:16,977
He's getting torn to shreds.

182
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:17,511
Ugh.

183
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:21,811
Uh, ah, ah.

184
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:22,777
[groaning]

185
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:24,944
Hm.

186
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,411
Huh?

187
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:28,377
Ah!

188
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:31,344
Wha-- what was that?

189
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:32,811
[music playing]

190
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,244
[sighs]

191
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:45,652
Huh?

192
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:50,544
Huh?

193
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:51,085
It's empty.

194
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:54,518
Hm?

195
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,277
TENDO: Check.

196
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,677
Huh?

197
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,011
How can that be?

198
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:07,677
Oh, you're not trying to
cheat me again, are you?

199
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:08,611
[rustling]

200
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:09,544
Hm?

201
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:10,444
[rustling]

202
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:13,444
Take this.

203
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:18,411
Looks like you scared it off.

204
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,311
Uh-huh.

205
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,344
And pretty fast, too.

206
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:23,544
What's this?

207
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:24,444
Saotome?

208
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:25,844
Where'd my man go?

209
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,611
Did you throw away
my check piece?

210
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,511
[grunts]

211
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,644
Don't play innocent, you.

212
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,877
Hi, I'm home.

213
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,444
Dad, something's not right.

214
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:39,411
What do you mean?

215
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,477
What's the matter?

216
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:41,444
[panting]

217
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,744
Daddy did you hear that?

218
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,644
I'm sure I heard something
underneath the floorboards.

219
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:47,944
What?

220
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:49,344
Hm.

221
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:52,011
Now that you mention it, Saotome
and I heard something strange

222
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,177
outside just awhile ago, too.

223
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:54,877
[grunts]

224
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,577
Oh, is something going on here?

225
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:58,544
[laughter]

226
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,011
Happosai?

227
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,677
Quit acting like scaredy-cats.

228
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:06,211
You must have expected this.

229
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:07,777
The members of the
Ogre Festival have

230
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,777
started arriving for
our planning meeting

231
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,744
here at the house.

232
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:11,711
[gasp]

233
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,077
[shouting]

234
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:28,093
[slurping]

235
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,440
[chewing]

236
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,820
More rice.

237
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,842
Ah, coming right up.

238
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:36,442
My, Ranma, you're
in high spirits.

239
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,876
Unreal.

240
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,242
You got an even bigger
appetite than normal,

241
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,742
even though you're hurt.

242
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,609
Got a point?

243
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,442
[laughs]

244
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,009
Us extreme fighters
have to eat well.

245
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,609
Especially when we're injured.

246
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,209
Eat like there's no tomorrow.

247
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,909
Ranma, if you lose
this competition,

248
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,776
it would mean the
end of the Anything

249
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:02,109
Goes School of martial arts,
as well as the Tendo Training

250
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:03,576
Hall losing its heir.

251
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,209
Saotome, come on.

252
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,042
There's lots of time for that.

253
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,576
I'm afraid not.

254
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,176
We'll talk about it
before the match.

255
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:11,642
What's the big deal, anyway?

256
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,442
We've got Akane.

257
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,642
Hey, you can handle running
the training hall without Ranma

258
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:18,042
around, can't you?

259
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,942
Ah, don;t be ridiculous.

260
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,209
I'll take that to
mean you do want Ranma

261
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,709
to be the training hall heir.

262
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,276
How's this any of
your business, anyway?

263
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:29,576
Hate to miss a good cat
fight, but I'm stuffed.

264
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,042
Time for a nap.

265
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,009
[receding footsteps]

266
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:34,442
Humph.

[clattering]

269
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:41,309
HAPPOSAI: Now, Ranma,
the time has come

270
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,009
that we test your true ability.

271
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:44,876
[chuckles]

272
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,309
One thing's for sure--
with all this training,

273
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,176
I'm a lot better at taking hits.

274
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,409
HAPPOSAI: First of
all, a word of prayer.

275
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,776
We vow to do our best to
protect this until sunrise.

276
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,842
We will not let our opponents
take this, nor shall

277
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:03,209
we let it drop from the rooftop.

278
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,542
And if I do, then
I've lost, right?

279
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,742
Exactly, Ranma.

280
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:10,109
Got any more questions?

281
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,042
[grunts]

282
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,509
No.

283
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:14,942
Very well.

284
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:19,476
The Ogre Festival of the Dark
will begin on the signal.

285
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,242
Be very careful.

Ranma?

291
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,742
Oh, It's just you.

292
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:45,309
Is your cut getting any better?

293
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,176
Forget it, it's no big deal.

294
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:50,409
Uh, a-are I'm sure you want
to stake your entire future

295
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:51,442
on this one competition?

296

297
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,976

Hm?

301
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,642
Kasumi, what are you doing?

302
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:14,376
You're still up?

303
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:17,742
Akane, I'm sure Ranma
will be just fine.

304
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,142
Uh-huh.

305
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:20,976
Why don't you rest?

306
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,076

ANNOUNCER: Time
for the festival.

310
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,809
Time to begin.

311
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:49,642
Who will be the
ogre, who will be it?

312
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:50,576
[panting]

313
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:55,142
Looks like they've arrived.

314
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,709
Hm, It sound like the
competition's started.

315
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:00,676
Uh-huh.

316
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,942
It does seem that it has begun.

[footsteps]

00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:06,342

[disembodied laughter]

321
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:13,576
MALE SPEAKER: He's it.

322
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:14,909
He's the new ogre.

323
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,042
He is the chosen one.

324
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,142
Huh.

325
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,476
Where are those creeps
hiding out, anyway?

326
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,017
Huh?

327
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:26,442
Ha.

328
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,542
Guess he figures I can
handle this on my own.

329
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,076
This will be fun.

330
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:34,909
Keep your eyes on
the tin can, old man.

331
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:35,450
Ah!

[shouts]

00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,476

[grunts]

335
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,109
Th-they just disappeared.

[snarling]

00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:49,976
Huh?

00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:51,442
A cat?

(THINKING) This cat
gives me the creeps,

342
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,476
and it's hunting me down.

343
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:58,276
Get lost, cat.

344
00:15:58,376 --> 00:15:59,909
Go find a rat or something.

345
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:00,450
[meowing]

00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:03,809
[music playing]

347
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:08,609
Huh?

348
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,942
That isn't even a
even a real cat.

349
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:11,876
[angry meow]

350
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,209
Ah!

351
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,642
Ahh.

352
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,742
I owe you one, old man.

353
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:22,076
Ranma, you're not taking
this seriously enough.

354
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:22,609
[barking]

355
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:25,309
I was trying.

356
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,042
Are those guys monsters?

357
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:28,276
What's the deal?

358
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:30,242
MALE SPEAKER: He's
not up to par, yet.

359
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:30,942
[chuckles]

360
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,842
MALE SPEAKER: Which
makes it dull for us.

361
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:36,476
MALE SPEAKER: The ogre
has to be stronger.

362
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:37,176
[grunts]

363
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:39,576
I hear you, monsters.

364
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,876
Ugh.

365
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,809
And I'll prove you wrong if
you lose the dirty tricks

366
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,476
and fight me like a man.

367
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,376
[derisive laughter]

368
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,909
[music playing]

369
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:09,642
[yawn]

370
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:14,509
[panting]

371
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,009
You've shown yourselves.

372
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:21,309
You're never going to beat me.

373
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,676
Old man, how about
lending me a hand?

374
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:29,576
I don't believe you.

375
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:32,776
You fell asleep on me.

376
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:36,142
You're going to regret this.

377
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:39,542
And don't bother coming back!

378
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,009
Huh?

379
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:42,976
The can!

380
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,442
[panting]

381
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:47,842
[yells]

382
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:53,076
All right, then.

383
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,176
Ugh.

384
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,476
I'm going to protect
this thing on my own.

385
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,942
[music playing]

386
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,909
Almost dawn.

387
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,709
Just a little longer.

388
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,976
You can do it, Ranma.

389
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:12,942
[panting]

390
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,376
[grunting]

391
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,709
(THINKING) It's almost sunrise.

392
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:25,042
I have to get rid of
these guys somehow.

393
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:26,509
I know.

394
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,709
This will get them.

395
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,609
[grunting]

396
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,376
I need you to give me those
firecrackers, old man.

397
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:36,842
My firecrackers?

398
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,409
What would you need
firecrackers for?

399
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:39,609
Just give it to me.

400
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:40,150
Ugh, ugh.

401
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:48,409
[grunting]

402
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:56,442
Try this one on for size.

403
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:57,942
[explosion]

404
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:05,983
Oh.

405
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,776
Those sure came in handy.

406
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,142
Ugh.

407
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:18,109
[grunt]

408
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,409
And the tin can is safe.

409
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:25,442
Very impressive
sparring, son-in-law.

410
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:26,176
Huh?

411
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,676
It-- it's you?

412
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,376
I knew you had it in you.

413
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,942
Congratulations.

414
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,809
I haven't seen that kind of
fighting spirit in decades.

415
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:34,909
Huh?

416
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,709
Wait, what's going--
don't tell me you guys--

417
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,676
[laughter]

418
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:40,909
The game goes to you.

419
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:43,576
It's hard to swallow,
but this time, you win.

420
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,376
You mean you guys were
my opponents tonight?

421
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,076
That's right.

422
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:52,009
Look, the sun's coming up.

423
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,942
Oh, what a lovely sunrise.

424
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,276
It's as if the sun is
celebrating your victory.

425
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,176
[music playing]

426
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:04,776
[laughter]

427
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,542
What a lovely night that was.

428
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:10,276
I can hardly remember the last
time I enjoyed a game so much.

429
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:10,976
Hm?

430
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,009
What do you mean, game?

431
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,842
This was supposed
to be a competition

432
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,276
that my whole future
was staked on?

433
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:16,976
Your future?

434
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,142
What you talking about?

435
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,142
Sounds to me like
old Happosai's

436
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:22,442
been messing around
with your head again.

437
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,176
Hm.

438
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:25,276
Here you be.

439
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,876
Seeing as you're the
winner, it's only fair

440
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,876
that you accept the prize.

441
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:29,509
Hm?

442
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,409
Uh.

443
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:32,976
Hey, this is--

444
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:33,942
[boing]

445
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,142
Shame on that old
raisin, lusting

446
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:39,842
after this stuff at his age.

447
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,776
I don't know what we're
going to do with him.

448
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:42,542
What?

449
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,776
You mean this match was--

450
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,542
Just a game we've been
playing since we were kids,

451
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,176
and still play
once every 10 years

452
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,576
when we get together
to relive old times.

453
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,942
We had an even better
time than usual,

454
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,009
seeing as you came
and played with us.

455
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:57,076
I figured it might be
special this year, seeing

456
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,742
as how you were in charge
of organizing it, hm?

457
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,442
[laughter]

458
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:02,409
That freak.

459
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:04,076
He's going to pay for this.

460
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,342
He's pulled a number on
me, and there's no way

461
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,309
he's going to get away with it.

462
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:09,209
[growls]

463
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,476
Hm?

464
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:12,376
Wha?

465
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,709
Ah, what a great sleep.

466
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,576
Oh, is the game
finished already?

467
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,776
Huh?

468
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,542
Oh, this is so sweet.

469
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:22,109
[laughs]

470
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,509
Oh, lucky day, they
all belong to me.

471
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:27,476
[growls]

472
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:30,009
Enjoy them while
you can, you freak.

473
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,142
[shouting]

474
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:33,409
(SHOUTING) It's the last
time you mess with me.

475
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,343
[theme music]

476
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:17,624
While walking in
the shopping mall,

477
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,624
Ranma and I come across
the guide from Jusenkyo.

478
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,658
What's he doing in Japan?

479
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:24,391
Next time on "Ranma 1/2," Nihao!

480
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,924
Jusenkyo Guide.

481
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:29,258
We'll see you there.
