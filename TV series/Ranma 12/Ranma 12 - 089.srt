-Ranma, is that really you?

00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,666
Ranma, what's happening to you?

00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,733
-Akane, don't look.

-But we don't have
to actually beat

him to get the
dragon whisker do we?

00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,066
-If you weren't such
a wimp, we could.

13
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,166
-Obviously, brute
force isn't working.

00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,600
-So just what are
you trying to say?

15
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,833
That we should give
up hope, and go home?

16
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,366
-Not when there's one
more thing we can try.

-Hmm?

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,066
And what would
that one thing be?

19
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:37,574
-This.

-Hey, it's sleeping

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,682
-Bingo.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,433
This time, though,
we'll use a bean bun.

24
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,166
-Last time, it was pork.

25
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,766
-So maybe with bean--

26

00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:01,633
Bean bun.

-We'll be good.

I do to help you?

00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,733
-What a fool.

45
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,500
I should have known that
it would still be the same.

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,933
Back then, me and Pop were
still training in China.

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,566
Ah, man, I'm so
hungry, I could eat--

-Give it back, please.

00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:08,933
You don't know
what you're doing.

50
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,533
-Try and stop me.

51
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,500
-You give that back right now.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,966
Give it up, porridge thief.

53
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:16,033
I'll be the one to--

-You!

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,066
Cut that out.

-Hey.

57
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,274
-More?

58
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,200
-A girl.

59
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Good thing.

-Keep your hands to
yourself, you jerk.

-That porridge you just
ate was our secret dish.

62
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,266
The stock was made with
a Dragon's Whisker.

63
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:36,966
-Dragon Whisker?

64
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,200
So what's that?

65
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,700
-It's a powerful ingredient
in medicinal cooking.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,466
There's no effect with women.

67
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:47,133
But should a man eat it,
his joy would be assured.

68
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:49,766
-His joy, huh?

69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,833
-Many a bloody battle
has been fought

70
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,366
through the years
over the porridge

71
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,966
we make here at our restaurant
with the Dragon's Whisker.

72
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,966
Really, you've no
idea how lucky it

73
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,500
is that you're a
girl and not a--

74
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,233
-So then you really are a guy?

75
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,300
-Give me a break, buddy.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,366
In what way is this
supposed to be a guy joy?

77
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,833
-Be that as it may,
in the meantime,

78
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:26,700
you can use this
until it wears off.

79
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,433
And that's the story
of how I ended up

80
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,700
bringing the Dragon's Whisker
back to Japan with me.

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,933
-So that's it.

82
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,400
With something so
powerful, no wonder

83
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,233
they're after you for it.

84
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,766
-What's this?

85
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,633
You're asking me to
tell you its secret.

86
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,666
-Of course, if a 3,000-year-old
Chinese ghoul doesn't know

87
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,233
the secret, then who does?

88
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,700
Ooh.

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,033
-Who are you calling at
3,000-year-old ghoul?

90
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:59,566
Well, I'll tell you one thing
about the Dragon's Whisker.

91
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,800
It's nothing but trouble.

92
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,233
Even if I did know more,
I wouldn't tell you.

93
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,700
-You can tell me.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
-I especially can't tell you.

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,233
-A secret I'm not
supposed to know.

96
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,866
Something that causes
trouble wherever it goes.

97
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,933
How are they related?

98
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:21,633
Hmm.

99
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,833
-Come back here, Ranma.

100
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,433
Give me that Dragon's Whisker.

101
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,500
-So now the master
wants it, too.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,733
Hmm, or maybe-- four tasty
little buns-- bean, curry,

103
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,400
pizza, pork.

104
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
And then there's the master.

105
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,600
They all want the Dragon's
Whisker and they're all-- ah,

106
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,066
they're all bald!

107
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,133
If my hunch is correct, then
the whisker's true power

108
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,300
is-- there's no time to waste.

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,700
-Wow.

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,266
It's magic.

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,766
The Dragon's Whisker is like
some kind of super hair growth

113
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,200
OK Aah.

115
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,233
That ought to do it.

-Gee, thanks.

117
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,500
-Those buns are still
after you though, right?

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,966
-Hey, I ain't afraid of that
bunch of little squirts.

119
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:29,974
Huh?

120
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,400
Watch out!

-Happosai?

124
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,000
-What'd you do that for?

125
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
-If you know what's
good for you,

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,033
you'll hand over the
Dragon's Whisker.

127
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,900
-So you figured out the
Dragon Whisker's power, huh?

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Figures.

129
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,766
Well, you're not getting
it without a fight.

130
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,200
-That's fine by me.

131
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:58,733
-Aah!

132
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,700
-What the--

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,000
-Why you.

134
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:07,966
-Had enough?

135
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,433
Happo-Fire Burst, coming up.

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,800
-Pop?

137
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,666
-Don't you worry, boy, your old
man still knows a trick or two.

138
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,766
-Since when are you on his side?

139
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,266
Silence, foul gnome.

140
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,066
Take this.

141
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,533
-Aah!

00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,900
[explosion]

143
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:37,966
[coughs] Genma, traitor.

144
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,566
Is that the way you
treat your master, huh?

145
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,966
-You may be my master, but
he's daddy's little boy.

146
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:53,066
Ranma, are you OK?

147
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,833
-Gee, Pop, you wouldn't happen
to be after the Dragon's

148
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,000
Whisker, too, now would you?

149
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,433
-Ranma, I'm shocked you'd accuse
your father of such a thing.

150
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,366
-It's just that I--

151
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,333
-[cries]

152
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,800
You wound your father's heart.

153
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:25,433
-I only-- Pop, I--

154
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:29,800
-It's OK.

155
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,333
I can't really blame you.

156

Trying to steal the Dragon
Whisker from my only son.

157
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,066
What kind of father is that?

158
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,500
A father who would.

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,100
A father who couldn't help but
take what he wants for himself.

160
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:49,500
Aah.

161
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,100
-Yep, that's my Dad.

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,666
-Ranma, it's your own fault
for not telling me earlier.

163
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,733
-Gee, I wonder why that is?

164
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,366
-Enough stalling, boy.

165
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,600
Give me that whisker and
give it to me right now.

166
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,333
-You ought to know better
than to ask me that.

167
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:08,366
-If that's the way
it's going to be.

168
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:12,200
[grunting]

169
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:16,574
-Gotcha!

170
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,033
Phew.

171
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,066
I am outta here.

172
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,533
-[moans]

173
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,600
-You OK?

174
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
-[moans]

175
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,100
-I didn't hurt you, did I, Pop?

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
-I'm fine, and I'm not crying
because I lost the fight.

177
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
-Then what is it
that's making you cry?

178
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,633
-I never thought that
my own flesh and blood

179
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,066
with some lousy
hair growth potion

180
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,533
would just leave me here to die.

181
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,733
Ha, Ha, Ha.

182
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,274
Not.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,233
It's mine.

184
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,833
It's all mine.

185
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,133
-Aah!

186
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:57,566
You dirty, no
good, rotten snake.

187
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,766
Aah!

188
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,933
--[laughs] Well, boy, how
do you like them apples?

189
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,841
-Wait!

190
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,700
Come back.

191
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,233
What was that for?

192
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,966
Now, haven't you
done enough to me?

193
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:19,533
Aah.

194
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,333
Oh, oh, yeah.

195
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,700
When I'm a girl, the Dragon
Whisker don't work, right?

196
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:33,166
-It's the sheer volume of
it that's got me worried.

197
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,800
If you don't get back
the Dragon's Whisker

198
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,700
within the next
week or so, you'll

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,333
run completely out of hair.

200
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,762
-At last, it's mine.

201
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,095
A 4,000-year-old cure.

202
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:16,695
All mine.

203
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,795
Oh, the indignities
I've had to suffer.

204
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:22,262
Unattractive to women.

205
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,262
Mocked by children.

206
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,328
Weeping before the mirror.

207
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,262
But now, that's all
about to change.

208
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:32,728
Mighty medals of
hair spring forth.

209
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,595
You rub it.

210
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:40,362
Strike it.

211
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,162
Wear it.

212
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,895
Ooh, that's no fair.

213
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,628
What good is it
if I can't use it?

214
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:56,528
-Oh, come on, give me a break.

215
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,495
What good is a head full of
hair going to do you anyway?

216
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,595
-You only say that,
because you've still

217
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,562
got all your own hair.

218
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,262
-What's that got to do with it?

219
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,262
-Everything, that's what.

220
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,362
Can't you try and have
a little compassion?

221
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,728
Don't you know how
hard it's been for me?

222
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:13,728
You're in over your
head here, boy.

223
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,862
You need me more than
some dumb whisker.

224
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,895
I can give you guidance,
give you counsel.

225
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:23,062
Heck, I could even give
you 10 whole yen for it.

226
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:24,928
-That does it.

227
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,228
[grunting]

228
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,728
-Quit trying to scam me, and
give me back that whisker.

229
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:34,595
-Mr. Saotome, do you want
Ranma to stay a girl?

230
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:35,228
-What?

231
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,495
Of course, not.

232
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,962
-Then you'd better listen
to what she's got to say.

233
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:42,762
-The Dragon's Whisker has
absolutely no effect on women.

234
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:46,628
For men who are bald, it's an
extremely powerful hair growth

235
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,695
tonic.

236
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,395
However, if a man should
already have hair,

237
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,128
he can go through an entire
lifetime's worth in a week.

238
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:56,028
-How terrifying.

239
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,362
I'd better check.

240
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:00,903
Wow.

241
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,028
If only I were so lucky.

242
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,628
-Was that really necessary?

243
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:13,428
How'd you like it if
I were to-- Now what?

244
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,728
-Huh?

245
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,062
Hmm.

246
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,395
-Ha, ha, ha.

247
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,995
The Dragon's
Whisker is all mine.

248
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,195
-Oh, no you don't.

249
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:25,562
Happosai.

250
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:26,128
-Oh.

251
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:27,562
Heh, heh, heh.

252
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:29,595
Sweet.

253
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:30,562
Ha, ha, ha.

254
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,328
-Now, that was a close shave.

255
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:36,995
-Save this, jerk!

256
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:41,403
-Aah!

257
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,995
-[laughs]

258
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,562
[explosion]

259
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:58,728
-He's going down.

260
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,895
Observe how quickly the
power of the Dragon's Whisker

261
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,895
turns father against son.

262
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,028
-Yeah, but they're
always like that, though.

263
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:10,462
-Who's that?

264
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,862
[explosion]

265
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,695
[scream]

266
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,662
[moan]

267
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:25,162
-Tell me how to use the Dragon's
Whisker or you'll be sorry.

268
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:26,162
Got me?

269
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:27,195
-Yeah, right.

270
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:28,262
Threaten all you want.

271
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,495
I'll never tell.

272
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,462
-If that's the way you want it.

273
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,495
-Gees, why does
everybody say that?

274
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,628
I boil the water, add the
whisker, add some rice, and--

275
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:41,762
-You fake!

276
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:43,262
-We'll get you for this.

277
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:44,162
Don't do it.

278
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:45,028
-What he said.

279
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,128
-Ha, I gotcha.

280
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:52,562
-Hey, why you a little--

281
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:58,262
-Aha.

282
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:00,262
Now that's my boy.

283
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:02,162
-Keep your hands off me.

284
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,762
-Thanks for the whisker, chump.

285
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:09,103
-Aah!

286
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,162
-What a good team
we are, eh, master?

287
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,795
So shall we make the
porridge together?

288
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,328
-Oh, no you don't.

289
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,662
Go find your own.

290
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:21,028
-They're both going down.

291
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,295
I have had enough.

292
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:51,962
-Ranma.

293
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:52,928
-Look, he's--

294
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,195
-OK, old man, get ready.

295
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,428
Because here it finally comes.

296
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,128
There, how's that?

297
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,762
Tight enough for you, Pop?

298
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:17,628
-Hasta la vista, baldy.

299
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,062
-Don't leave me.

300
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,062
-Don't worry.

301
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:21,962
He won't.

302
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,395
-I'll be right back.

303
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,895
Hey, What's going on?

304
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,428
-Now it's your turn, freak.

305
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:41,295
Huh?

306
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,795
Want some more?

307
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:53,303
Whoa!

308
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,595
-It broke off.

309
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:03,162
-That means--

310
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,362
-It stopped growing.

311
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,195
-Hey, you've run out of hair.

312
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,395
-It was the fight.

313
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:27,595
He must've used up all his
hair launching his attack.

314
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:28,144
-No.

315
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:28,603
No!

316
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:42,128
-Hey, um, well, I know.

317
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,095
Well--

318
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,895
-You're making it worse, OK?

319
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:45,695
Please stop.

320
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,262
-I'm sorry, boy.

321
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,128
But you know, if you're
anything like you're old man,

322
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,928
sooner or later you were
going to lose it all anyway.

323
00:18:56,462 --> 00:18:58,428
-Look, don't flatter
yourself, OK?

324
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,095
I am nothing like you.

325
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:03,403
-Ranma.

326
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,369
-Huh?

327
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:09,562
Oh, yeah.

328
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:12,862
If I eat the whisker
porridge, then-- Give me back

329
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:15,395
the Dragon Whisker, you thief.

330
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,362
-What kind of a fool
do you take me for?

331
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:19,662
You know better than to
ask me to give something

332
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:22,562
I just-- what?

333
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,103
What?

334
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,662
I must've dropped it.

335
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:32,528
-It doesn't come out.

336
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,695
If he'd really used up
his hair, he'd be bald.

337
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:36,695
But he isn't.

338
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:39,328
So that means the
effect's worn off.

339
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,062
-That's great.

340
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,062
-Where'd it go?

341
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:42,895
Where's the whisker?

342
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:43,962
Well, where'd it go?

343
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:44,795
Where'd you drop it?

344
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:45,562
-I don't remember.

345
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,995
-What's the matter with him?

346
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,262
You'd think he'd be happy.

347
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:51,828
I just told him he's cured.

348
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,395
-I'm sure he'll
wake up eventually.

349
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:05,295
-Who would have thought
we'd find it here?

350
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:07,162
-Oh, yeah, if we'd
known, we could've

351
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:08,562
come here in the first place.

352
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:09,762
-Exciting, isn't it?

353
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:11,928
-Boy, I'll say.

354
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,862
-They're practically
wetting themselves.

355
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,295
-Look at the bright side.

356
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:22,662
Now you can tie off your
pigtail with anything.

357
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:33,895
-Oh, dear, as of yesterday, the
several thousand year whisker

358
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,362
freshness date has run out.

359
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,962
I'll have to be sure
to alert my customers.

360
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:42,428
-Ta-da!

361
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:43,895
One order special porridge.

362
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:45,395
ALL: Aah!

363
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,362
Let's dig in.

364
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:49,603
-Uh-hmm.

365
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:50,928
Uh-hmm.

366
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:51,928
I see.

367
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:52,895
Thanks for calling.

368
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,362
Shampoo.

369
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:00,628
I just got off the phone
with the restaurant in China.

370
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,762
It seems we're past the
Dragon's Whisker use-by date.

371
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,095
-Shampoo sad to hear that.

372
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:09,495
But since customers so happy,
maybe it's better no tell.

373
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:10,795
-Very true.

374
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,162
They'll find out for
themselves soon enough.

375
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:14,562
-It's starting to come in.

376
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:15,828
I just know it.

377
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,595
-Mine's growing, too.

378
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:18,862
-Mine will be next.

379
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,495
-It's going to be great.

380
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,162
-After all this time.

381
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:23,328
-I feel younger already.

382
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:28,762
-There.

383
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:29,462
How's that?

384
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,328
-What do you think?

387
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,007
-Shampoo kept her promise.

388
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,007
-I wish that these two would.

389
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:21,773
That's right.

390
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:22,973
They're back.

391
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:26,073
-Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
Ling-Ling and Lung-Lung

392
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:27,407
strike back.

393
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,807
We'll see you there.
