178
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,512
It's not like you to
treat a girl to snacks.

KUNO: I have a favor to ask.

180
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:16,546
Keep in mind that a
man of my position

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,412
is not accustomed to
asking for favors.

I would take it ill indeed if
you were to take me lightly

So spill it, already.

Now, what can I
do for you, Kuno?

what your evil has done.

338
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,279
Hello there, pig-tailed girl.

339
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,046
[squeak]

340
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,979
-Eh, just be quiet
and do as you're told.

341
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,212
(FEMALE VOICE) Y--,
y--, yes, master!

342
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:10,846
(MALE VOICE) Here I come.
(FEMALE VOICE) Oh, oh, please!

343
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:11,346
Mother!

344
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:22,679
(MALE VOICE) Oh,
it's so terrible!

345
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,779
-Leave me out of your
sick fantasies, pal.

346
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,746
-Silence!

347
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,579
You enslaver of women!

348
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:28,146
Hyah!

349
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,912
[slashing noise]

350
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,646
-I shall smite thee
and then I shall

351
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,946
rescue the pig-tailed one!

352
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:37,146
Hyah!

353
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,012
-Oh, I get it.

354
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,112
So if you lose, you'll
forget all about her, right?

355
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:45,479
[grunts]

356
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:46,812
-Fortune smiles.

357
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:47,712
[grunts]

358
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,479
[slashing noise]

359
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:50,979
-Ha!

360
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:51,479
Ha!

361
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:52,912
Hai!

362
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:53,446
-Hey!

363
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,479
These are--

364
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,879
-You insult me with
your inattention?

365
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:59,912
I shall teach you not to take
Tatewaki Kuno so lightly.

366
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:00,479
-Huh?

367
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,912
[slashing noise]

368
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:05,346
-Hello.

369
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,512
Akane!

370
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,879
-Excuse me, but
there's something

371
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,912
I think you ought
to know, Ranma.

372
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:11,879
When Kuno gets really
mad about something,

373
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:13,579
he's really hard to beat.

374
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,179
You'd better start paying more
attention to what you're doing,

375
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:18,179
or he's going to
make you regret it.

376
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,612
-And there's something that
I think you ought to know.

377
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,846
Those polka-dotted panties
don't really suit you.

378
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:24,779
-Oh!

379
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:29,079
Ohh-- Dry up and die!

380
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,446
-At last, the game ends.

381
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,412
-Huh?

382
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,412
[laughing]

383
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,046
-Whoa!

384
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:51,279
[slashing noises]

385
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,212
-Whoa!

386
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:55,179
Why, just the air
pressure alone--

387
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:56,646
-Out of the way, stupid!

388
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,112
-I have--

389
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:58,746
-Watch out!

390
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:00,079
Eyes front, idiot!

391
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,846
[gasps]

392
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,312
-Huh?

393
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:18,046
-It's all over, Kuno.

394
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,312
-You will address
me as uppercla--

395
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,712
[groans]

396
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,312
-So how'd you do that, Ranma?

397
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,146
-Wow!

398
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,946
Each blow hit a vulnerable spot!

399
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:42,246
-You mean you kicked him?

400
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,246
I couldn't even
see your feet move.

401
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,512
-Huh.

402
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,879
I thought upperclassmen
Kuno'd put up more of a fight.

403
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,212
-What do you mean, Ranma?

404
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,246
You took a hit, too, didn't you?

405
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,212
-It's nothing.

406
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,379
-You mean, even right over here?

407
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:57,012
Is it really OK?

408
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,879
[groaning]

409
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:00,646
So it's nothing, huh?

410
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,779
Say, what was it that distracted
you in the fight, anyway?

411
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,679
-This.

412
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,812
-What in the world?

413
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:10,512
What were you doing
with these photos of me?

414
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,412
I'm afraid to even ask about it!

415
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:15,879
-What was I-- Kuno
had the photos.

416
00:21:15,912 --> 00:21:17,946
-Oh, Nabiki!

417
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:20,812
-Can't blame a girl for
trying to make a little cash.

418
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,612
-Ha!

419
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:22,112
-Huh!

420
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:23,979
What's big deal?

421
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:28,312
Who would want a bunch of boring
shots like these ones, anyway?

422
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:30,746
You'd better start working on
making yourself at least half

423
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,346
as sexy as me, or you'll
never get a husband.

424
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:35,846
-Oh!

425
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:43,712
Get back here, Ranma!

426
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:45,546
-And one more for posterity.

427
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,879
[click]

428
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:05,894
[theme music]

429
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:41,075
AKANE: I am too
a grown-up woman.

430
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:42,975
I just wish Doctor
Tofu would stop

431
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,242
treating me like a little girl!

432
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,542
And I wish he wouldn't
go confiding in Ranma.

433
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,975
Of all people!

434
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,075
Geez!

435
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:51,075
He'd get more understanding
from a cabbage.

436
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:54,909
Next time, on Ranma 1/2,
Love Me To The Bone--

437
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:56,542
The Compound Fracture
of Akane's Heart.

438
00:23:56,575 --> 00:24:00,075
See you there.
