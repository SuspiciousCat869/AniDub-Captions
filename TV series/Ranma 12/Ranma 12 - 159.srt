I've made some tea for you you.

We got to go.

177
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:11,455
Huh, there you go.

178
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,188
Ha.

179
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:12,688
Here you go.

00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:13,288
And, uh--

181
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:13,955
Uh.

182
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,488
Excuse me, Dr. Tofu.

183
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:16,155

Could you listen it
a little, Mr. Saotome?

188
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:29,955
Mr. Tendo, I'm going to need you
to tighten your side up a bit.

189
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:33,188
Considerate it done.

00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:39,696
OK.

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:42,196
If you say.

195
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:42,863

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,263
All done.

203
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,029
No!

204
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,429

Hm.

208
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,196
Something tells me Ranma must
have had a hand in this mess.

209
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,663
(MIMICKING) I'll protect you
from the dangerous typhoon,

210
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,629
Akane.

211
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,263
That's why Ranma did this.

212
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:16,896
Hey!

213
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:18,763
Let me in, please!

I'm your father.

You can't do this to me.

[gasp] Ranma!

217
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,896
Hurry and open up.

We sure got a lot
of work done today.

00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,870
And just in time before
the strong rains hit.

230
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,904
Dr Tofu, your
dinner's getting cold.

231
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:55,770
Don't wait for us.

232
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:57,237
You just help yourself.

233
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,837
I will.

for inviting me.

Grandfather, you're
just in time for dinner.

259
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,204
What are you doing
in this dark room?

260
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,004
Why didn't you come
and eat with us?

261
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,570
What is that?

262
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,170
Someone took a tile off
the roof on purpose?

263
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:02,904
Yeah.

264
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:04,470
That creeps me out.

00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:08,304
Hey, Saotome, are you sure it
wasn't some kind of mistake?

The door was open so I
thought it was grandfather.

272
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:21,611
And when I looked in,
the room was like this.

273
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,478
I see.

274
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:23,611
Now it makes sense.

275
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,811
What Mr. Saotome told
us must be true then.

276
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:26,611
[grunt]

277
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:27,445
Hey, look.

278
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:29,278
It's wet.

279
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,845
The ceiling in
here isn't leaking.

280
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:33,478
So it must mean someone's come
in wet from the rain and is

281
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,411
in the house now.

282
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:35,811
Ranma!

00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,211
Hm.

284
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,545
I don't know who's behind
all this weird stuff,

285
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,445
but it looks like we've
got a mystery to solve.

288
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:50,411
It's wet here too.

289
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:52,778
And inside here.

290
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,178
All the way up the stairs?

291
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,278
Where's this water coming from?

292
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:56,809
Huh?

293
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:01,311
All right!

Yeah?

00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,078
Well, excuse me for caring!

299

So for the time being,
he's completely paralyzed.

are you, Akane?

Oh.

333
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,478
Now I remember.

334

I'll have some more.

Right away.

do to deserve seconds?

Tell me that!

He sneaked into the house.

He got everything sopping wet!

344
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,448
And on top of that,
he attacked Akane!

Ludicrous!

00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,281
I never attacked anybody.

347
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:44,181
That's just my way of saying
a friendly, how do you do?

348
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,114
[chomping]

349
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:46,648
That's good enough
reason for me.

350
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,181
Besides, we can't just
kick the poor fellow out

351
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,381
on a night like tonight.

352
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:51,814
[grunt]

353
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,481
Then how do you explain
that he broke into the house

354
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:54,614
instead of using the door?

355
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,148
Oh, this is yummy.

356
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:56,648
Let it go.

357
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,148
Will you?

358
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,214
Besides, maybe he'll give
us a free frog performance.

359
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,481
Right, froggy?

360
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,114
Hm?

361
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,248
What?

362
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,781
Were you talking to me
just now, young lady?

363
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:10,348
[music playing]

364
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,281
Oh.

365
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,681
Very good.

366
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:17,648
Cute.

367
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:18,814
[grunt]

368
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,614
Those frogs have
some kind of talent.

369
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,981
[clapping]

370
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,848
And that's our
performance for today.

371
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:28,114
I hope you enjoyed the
talented Men in Green.

372
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,348
I usually charge admission,
but today it's on the house.

373
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:32,514
Huh?

374
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:33,648
Nothing but a bunch
of cheap skates.

375
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,848
Uh.

376
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,048
Speaking of pets,
I heard somewhere

377
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,548
that you people have a rare pet.

378
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,248
Do you think I could
take a look at it?

379
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,514
Oh.

380
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,748
I bet you must mean that
unusual fish Ranma brought home

381
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:43,948
with him today.

382
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:46,648
It seems to be a
very rare species.

383
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,414
Right, Doctor?

384
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:48,414
Yes.

385
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,748
A very rare species indeed.

386
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,048
FROG HERMIT: Is that so?

387
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,414
Well, I'll excuse myself
if you don't mind.

388
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,814
He doesn't look too healthy.

389
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,714
He hasn't eaten
anything all day.

390
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:07,948
I think he needs to
have a bigger tank.

391
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,981
What the heck are
you doing in my room?

392
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,448
Oh, this is an
extremely rare species,

393
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,048
so you have to take
good care of it.

394
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,781
What's it got to do with you?

395
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:16,981
Come off it, Ranma.

396
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:19,048
He's just giving
some friendly advice.

397
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,414
I don't know.

398
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:23,981
Maybe I should ask Dr. Tofu to
take a look at my fish here.

399
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:24,714
Ah!

400
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:25,548
[crash] [grunt]

401
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,314
Are you OK, Ranma?

402
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,581
Thanks a lot!

403
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:29,414
Oh.

404
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:30,714
That's such a shame.

405
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:33,548
You should be more careful.

406
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,448
You're the one who
tripped me, jerk.

407
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,481
Oh, well.

408
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,748
Accidents happen.

409
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,681
I put the little
guy in the pond.

410
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,448
No need to thank me. [laughs]

411
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,448
Like someone was gonna!

412
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:45,648
Creepy frog.

413
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:46,981
Go, Ranma!

414
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:47,448
Right.

415
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:48,348
Hold it!

416
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:57,548
I think he's going to
release him into the pond.

417
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:58,148
Yeah.

418
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:04,314
I need you to grow a little
bit bigger for me, friend.

419
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:29,081
[gasp] No!

420
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:30,114
Hm.

421
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,114
Nope.

422
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,648
I'm not getting
anything here, Saotome.

423
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,348
Maybe you should go
back up on the roof

424
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:35,614
and check on that antenna.

425
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:39,148
[snoring]

426
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:40,681
Yo, Pop!

427
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,348
Tea's on, everyone.

428
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,881
Oh, where did Dr. Tofu get to?

429
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:47,748
He said he needed to look at
some of Happosai's old biology

430
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:48,914
textbooks.

431
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:50,548
So he went into the
old goad's room.

432
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:51,448
Huh?

433
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,648
KASUMI: The power's off.

434
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,681
TENDO: [sigh]
Wouldn't you know it.

435
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:54,448
The candles are all upstairs.

436
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,281
AKANE: No probs.

437
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,314
I'll go get them.

438
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:57,081
I'll go with you.

439
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:05,881
Thanks, Ranma.

440
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:06,848
That's much better.

441
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,381
Did you find anything out?

442
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,114
Yes.

443
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,014
I think so.

444
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:13,348
I'm not entirely
certain yet, but this

445
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:17,081
might be quite a bit more
serious than we first thought.

446
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,648
How do you mean?

447
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,481
A baby dragon?

448
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,048
That little fish?

449
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,114
Are you saying
it's a real dragon?

450
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,681
I couldn't believe it myself,
but now I'm quite confident.

451
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:34,948
Take a look at this.

452
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,048
Incredible!

453
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:45,881
This dragon grows as the
storm builds and rises

454
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,481
to the sky like a giant tornado.

455
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:50,748
Uh.

456
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,948
Like at tornado?

457
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,048
Are you sure it's
not just a legend?

458
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,781
It's a legend based on truth.

459
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,514
And there's one other
legend surrounding

460
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,281
the gigantic dragon.

461
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:00,781
What is it?

462
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:04,114
Eating the dragon's
flesh gives eternal life.

463
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,348
[gasp]

464
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,281
A single bite of the
dragon's flesh, and your life

465
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,181
is extended by 100 years.

466
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,581
That's why the dragon has
been sought after and slain

467
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:13,881
for many generations.

468
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,248
Man, if even some of
this stuff is true,

469
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,281
then I'm going to
totally ace that paper

470
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,081
I've got to do for
homework this weekend.

471
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,381
You know, your homework marks
aren't really the issue here,

472
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,714
Ranma.

473
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:29,414
First, we have to make
sure it is the dragon.

474
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:37,348
Man, what a gross night.

475
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,248
Look!

476
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,314
There's the frog hermit!

477
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,614
Get over here!

478
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:42,448
Oh.

479
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,914
It's your dad!

480
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:48,414
What are you doing sitting
out here in the rain, Pop?

481
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,348
Way to go, Mr. Saotome!

482
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,348
You were eavesdropping.

483
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:52,548
Weren't you, Pop?

484
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,148
Uh-uh.

485
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,081
Ha!

486
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,048
[growl]

487
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,714
That proves that
you were listening!

488
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,381
Jeez, you'd think he'd
have better things

489
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,548
to do with his time.

490
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,514
Oh, no!

491
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,748
Ranma!

492
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:10,114
We've got to do something
or the baby dragon

493
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,381
will be washed
away by the storm.

494
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:13,648
Got ya!

495
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,114
Akane, go get me a
bucket on the double.

496
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:15,748
Right!

497
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,214
Hold on, you two.

498
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,114
A bucket's not going to be
nearly big enough anymore.

499
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,548
My little fish is enormous.

500
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,714
I knew it.

501
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,481
So it really is a dragon.

502
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,948
You're going to
make me a fine feast,

503
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,514
aren't you, little dragon.

504
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,314
I knew you had something up
your sleeve, you poison toad!

505
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:35,048
Ah.

506
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:36,181
Very clever.

507
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:37,581
I came all the way from
China to get my hands

508
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:38,714
on this baby dragon.

509
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,048
Too bad for you.

510
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,614
I need this dragon so I
can finish my homework.

511
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:44,181
Will you forget about
your dumb homework

512
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,248
and just concentrate
on the issue?

513
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,514
I can't help it.

514
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,681
That paper's for a lot of marks.

515
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:50,348
I know.

516
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:51,114
I know.

517
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:51,589
You've told me.

518
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:53,655
Now.

519
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,589
[grunting]

520
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:55,522
[yelling]

521
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:56,355
Ranma!

522
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,389
Akane!

523
00:17:57,422 --> 00:18:01,455
I'll get them! [grunting]

524
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:06,822
My frogs!

525
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:09,389
Now, it's your
turn to have a nap.

526
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,289
Let me take care of this guys.

527
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,789
[grunt]

528
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,155
Ha, ha, ha.

529
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:21,455
[yelling]

530
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:23,022
Ranma!

531
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,189
Now that you're
out of the way I'll

532
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,455
help myself to my delectable
little dragon dish.

533
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:36,155
[yelling] Oh.

534
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,255
If you think we're going
to subject this baby

535
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,555
dragon to such a
horrible fate then you've

536
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,022
got another thing
coming, frog hermit.

537
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,355
Huh?

538
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,789
Let's just see about that.

539
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,122
[yelling]

540
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:52,289
--[blah] You have a lot
to learn, science boy,

541
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:55,122
if you think you stand a
chance against ancient Chinese

542
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,955
fighting traditions
such as this one.

543
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:02,455
Dr. Tofu, I believe
this is your weak point.

544
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,355
Hm?

545
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,255
Uh.

546
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,455
Hello, Kasumi.

547
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,555
Beautiful weather.

548
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,189
Told you I'd win.

549
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,122
No!

550
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,355
Dr. Tofu!

551
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:13,522
[grunt]

552
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:16,022
We could do this
all night, you know.

553
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,655
Go!

554
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,922
This time things are going to
turn out a little different.

555
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:22,655
Ah!

556
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,122
[boom]

557
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,989
[yelling]

558
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,122
Got it!

559
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,989
Way to go!

560
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:32,722
Oh.

561
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,222
Nice work.

562
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,555
[thunder]

563
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:42,055
[explosion]

564
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,489
[crash]

565
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,155
Now what's going on out there?

566
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:46,630
[grunt]

567
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,596
Oh.

568
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,163
Oh, no!

569
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:49,696
Look.

570
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,563
What's that?

571
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,563
Oh, my.

572
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,130
[gasp]

573
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:55,530
[gasp]

574
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:15,430
[roar]

575
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,730
What a haul!

576
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,763
What a haul!

577
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:44,363
I'd sell my soul for
a week of typhoons.

578
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,730
Hm?

579
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:48,296
Oh.

580
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,296
A dragon.

581
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:57,496
[grumble] Ruh-roh.

582
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,096
You're bye.

583
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,930
[growl] Huh?

584
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh, wait, my lovelies.

585
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,096
I'll save you.

586
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,863
Ha ha.

587
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:09,430
[music playing]

588
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:11,763
[laughing]

589
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,996
FROG HERMIT: Gather
around in the guineas.

590
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,596
CHILD: Parade! [laughs]

591
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,263
My pet frogs and I have a very
special show lined up for you

592
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,630
today.

593
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,563
And believe me, you'll never
see anything like this on TV.

594
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:22,463
[laughs] Don't worry.

595
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:23,730
I'll pass the hat later.

596
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:24,663
Gather around now.

597
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:26,263
The show's about to begin.

598
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:27,096
Look.

599
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,396
The frog hermit's still in town.

600
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,630
That's him all right.

601
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,730
But he looks a lot
happier somehow.

602
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:32,496
Yeah.

603
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,730
You're right.

604
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,730
What do you say we
check out the show?

605
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:36,463
Good plan!

606
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:47,224
[music playing]

607
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,779
NARRATOR: When we were
all little, looking up,

608
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:21,913
you could always count on the
smiling face of your mother.

609
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:26,013
Next time on "Ranma 1/2,"
"Boy Meets Mom, Part One."

610
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,379
We'll see you there.
