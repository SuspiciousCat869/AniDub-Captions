00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,900
WEATHERMAN: And as you can see,
with this large low pressure

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,666
front building off
the coast, it looks

4
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,433
like we just might be in
store for a White Christmas

5
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,700
after all.

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,166
And I'm sure all the kids
watching would love that.

7
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,766
And now a word from--

8
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,500
I sure hope it
snows, don't you?

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,466
Check.

10
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,833
Oh, I didn't see that.

11
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,733
Way back when I was a boy,
Nabiki, no one in Japan

12
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,666
even celebrated Christmas.

13
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,566
Back at you, Saotome.

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,666
I didn't see that
move coming, Tendo.

15
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:07,600
Yes.

16
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,133
Back in the good
old days everyone

17
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,166
around here was a Buddhist.

18
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,966
Say, Nabiki, have
you seen Akane?

19
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:14,966
They're not home yet.

20
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,866
Oh, well, I hope
everyone is hungry

21
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,500
because I'm preparing the
biggest Christmas dinner ever.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,866
BOTH: Hooray!

23
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,133
Hooray for Christmas!

24
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,133
Hooray!

25
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,300
Hooray for Christmas!

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,866
Ugh.

27
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,733
BOTH: Hooray!

28
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,900
Hmm?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,833
Oh, my.

30
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,633
It looks like it's
going to snow.

32
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,800
[gasp] That's so pretty!

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,533
Uh, we don't have time
to window shop, Akane,

34
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:49,433
and I didn't tag along with you
because I wanted to, you know.

35
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't forget, we lost the
bet and had to do the family

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
Christmas shopping, remember?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,833
And besides, why don't
you relax and try

38
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,800
to get into the
spirit of the season?

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,966
(GRUMPILY) Oh, man.

40
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey, you never told
me what you wanted

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,666
to get for Christmas yet.

42
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,766
Hmm?

43
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,366
Well, I don't remember
you telling me what

44
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,266
you were wishing for either.

45
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,666
Oh, that's easy.

46
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,800
I'd like that stuffed
animal, a new blouse

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,333
with a skirt to match,
a handbag, a music box,

48
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,266
maybe a few handkerchiefs,
a sweater, some cards-- oh,

49
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,133
that new hat.

50
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,633
That's all?

51
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,833
If I had to buy half
the stuff on your list

52
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:28,266
I'd be flat broke, so
just keep dreaming girl.

53
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:31,366
Then you should look for a job.

54
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:32,933

you, and Merry Christmas.

Uh.

61
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,100
That--

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,766
--Uh.

63
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,966
--was for Shampoo, right?

64
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,833
--[nervous laugh] Well, I
guess it isn't anymore.

65
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,133
It's your fault.

66
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,466
Huh?

67
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,700
How in the heck can you say
it was my fault when you're

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,900
the doofus who ran into me!

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,333
Mousse, what are you--

70
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:19,233
You know it's your fault, Ranma
Saotome, and you'll pay for it!

71
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,733
[crowd gasps]

72
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,333
What do you think
you're doing, Mousse?

73
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,466
No!

74
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,466
This time you're going
to have to make me stop!

75
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:30,233
I think Mousse might be
getting a little loopy here.

76
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,000
You head home.

77
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,333
I'll catch up.

78
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,133
Well, you better hurry because
we still have to decorate.

79
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,700
All right, I'll try.

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,366
Let's do it!

81
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,200
Hyuh!

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,500
Hyuh!

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,766
Mommy, look!

84
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,100
Those boys will get
a lump of coal, dear.

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,366
Hey, you better remember what
I told you or you're in trouble!

86
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,233

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,600
For your Information,
Akane, Ranma

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,833
is going to be spending
Christmas Eve with me

90
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,233
at my house.

91
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,933
Well, for your
information Ranma

92
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,766
is staying at home with
his family and friends.

93
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,600
Is your family going to be
singing carols and eating

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,766
Christmas cake?

95
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,700
Yeah, of course.

96
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,833
Oh, only little
children still do that,

97
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,833
but couples who
are truly in love

98
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,000
spend it together in
front of warm fire.

99
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
Did Ranma say he was
coming over to your house?

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,766
No, not yet.

101
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,233
Ranma, wait for me!

102
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,066
Ah!

103
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,366
Yah!

104
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:30,766
What an air head.

105
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,900
AKANE: I'm home!

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,900
Where's Ranma?

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,633
Who knows.

108
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,400
Uh oh, another fight.

109
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,866
You two ready to
start decorating?

110
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,533
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
Akane, [snorts]

111
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:49,000
could I have your bra as my
Christmas gift, huh? [crash]

112
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,541
Oh.

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,866
Akane, isn't Ranma
supposed to be

114
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,933
home by now, or
is there something

115
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,633
that happened between you two?

116
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,666
Um, what are you asking me for?

117
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:09,133
Well, I'm starting to get
a little worried about him.

118
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,566
I'm sure Ranma will
be home at any minute.

119
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,633
Tendo's right.

120
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,233
Don't worry.

121
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,733
Ah!

122
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,700
[yells]

123
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,266
Let's see you get out
of that one, Saotome.

124
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,100
Oh, yeah?

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Take that!

126
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,366
Ah!

127
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:23,933
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:24,900
Oh.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,100
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER):
Ranma is going

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,266
to be spending Christmas
Eve with me at my house.

131
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:32,666
[sighs]

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,033
Shampoo planning to cook
most delicious turkey dinner

133
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,300
for you, Ranma.

134
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,166
Sounds great.

135
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,200
But first-- oh,
you must promise

136
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
you'll spend all
Christmas Eve at my house.

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,866
You know, I've always
had this crazy dream

138
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:49,200
about eating a whole
turkey all by myself.

139
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,666
Oh, how dare you!

140
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:51,533
You-- you pig!

141
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,066
Ugh!

142
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,066
I've had it!

143
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
No, sorry.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,566
Shampoo hasn't come home yet.

145
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,533
In fact, I've been sitting
here waiting for her all day.

146
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,766
Well, thank you.

147
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,833
Do you want to leave
a message for her?

148
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,833
No, that's all right.

149
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:10,400
Hiya!

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,200
Shampoo is home.

151
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,741
Shampoo!

152
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,133
Oh, Akane!

153
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,900
I was just wondering
where's Ranma?

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
[laughs]

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,466
Huh?

156
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,866
Akane, you mean Ranma
no come home yet?

157
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,033
Here Shampoo thinking of
going Akane house to get him.

158
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,600
Shampoo go look.

159
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,141
Ah!

160
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Shampoo!

161
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,800
No, I'm coming too!

162
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,633
Ah, it's Christmas Eve today.

163
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,000
Now aren't they cute?

164
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,033
If only I was 100 years younger.

165
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:39,400
[laughs]

166
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,033
Come on, Shampoo, wait up!

167
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,766
Why should me wait for you?

168
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,033
Ugh.

169
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:46,966
Grr.

170
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,933
Oh!

171
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey, what's the big deal if
we look for Ranma together?

172
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
You're right.

173
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,866
We both want my Ranma
for the same thing.

174
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,200
Uh, I guess so.

175
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,033
Maybe if we find-- oh!

176
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:05,200
[gasp] Mousse!

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,400
So were you chasing
Ranma when this happened?

178
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,300
That's correct.

179
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,566
Tell Shampoo what happen you.

180
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,133
I was right behind him when
I ran into a little problem.

181
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:15,674
Problem?

182
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,133
Huh!

183
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,966
Hyuh!

184
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,966
You'll pay for ruining
Shampoo's Christmas present!

185
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:30,033
Hey, I'm too busy to fight you
right now, so just back off,

186
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,266
buddy.

187
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,466
You owe me Ran-- ugh!

188
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,007
Huh?

189
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:34,507
Ugh!

190
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:41,400
[girls yelling]

191
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:49,300
[mousse yelling]

192
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,233
Oh, the pain!

193
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,933
Just before you crashed, do
you know where he was headed?

194
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,766
Oh, my Ranma headed
straight my place.

195
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:00,366
In your dreams.

196
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,100
Oh, but he isn't
the type that would

197
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,900
come running straight
home to decorate either.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,233
In your story, Mousse, you
said something about thief?

199
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,233
The answer to that is Happosai.

200
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:11,774
Huh?

201
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,274
Akane!

202
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,300
Hmm?

203
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
There are red-nosed
reindeer behind you!

204
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,900
BOTH: Huh?

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,866
Oh, well.

206
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,200
Reindeer now gone.

207
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,566
[pigeon coos]

208
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,000
[groans]

209
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:37,333
If I was using my head, I
would've just stayed at home.

210
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,666
Oh, I can't believe my luck.

211
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,733
Not that it's any different
than it's been all year.

212
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,500
Cheer up.

213
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,333
It can't be all that bad.

214
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,466
You don't understand, Akane.

215
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:51,166
I spend every last cent I had
buying that present for Shampoo

216
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:54,433
and now it's ruined,
and so is my Christmas.

217
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,900
But you can't give up.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
You know, if you really
like her there's other ways

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,066
you can show her.

220
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,166
You've got to get out
there and-- and let

221
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,100
her know you want to spend
Christmas Eve with her.

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,333
[sighs] Remember,
you can't give up.

223
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,666
You're right.

224
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,333
I've got to climb the highest
mountain, ford the widest

225
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:16,766
ocean, I have got to be a man!

226
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,566
OK, but I don't think that
you have to go quite that far,

227
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,800
if you know what I mean.

228
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,800
(SINGING) We're hanging
the socks by the fire bright

229
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,533
and drinking sake
'til I'm really tight.

230
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,366
(SINGING) Hoping Santa
will come tonight.

231
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,333
The turkey's on the
table ready to be carved,

232
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:32,133
and everybody's hungry,
everybody's starved.

233
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,500
What's this?

234
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,300
Ranma wants a girl's bike and
a boy's bike for Christmas?

235
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
You made this up.

236
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,800
BOTH: [laughs]

237
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,300
[door opening]

238
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Ready or not, I'm coming in!

239
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,333
Ugh!

240
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,200
Oh, hello, Akane.

241
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
So, can I help you?

242
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,866
Huh?

243
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,366
What's wrong?

244
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:57,566
I want you to tell me exactly
where Ranma is right now,

245
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,433
just like you told Shampoo.

246
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,100
Oh, sure, and why are
you looking for Ranma?

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,100
Huh?

248
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
I just told him to
come straight home

249
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,533
and help us get the house ready
for Christmas, that's all.

250
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,333
And after we're
done decorating he

251
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:14,133
can spend the rest of the night
with Shampoo for all I care.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,366
Sorry, if that's the extent
of your reasons to find Ranma,

253
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,033
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

254
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:22,574
Huh?

255
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,176
Huh.

256
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,709
Happosai.

257
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,576
Yes, dear.

258
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,209
Oh, now I get it!

259
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,609
Shampoo came here and
bribed you with the ramen.

260
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,109
So what'd she give you
to keep your mouth shut?

261
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,376
No--nothing!

262
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,943
Honestly, she didn't
give me a single thing.

263
00:11:59,043 --> 00:11:59,776
Uh.

264
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:00,976
Hey, what's that on the floor?

265
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:01,517
I, uh--

266
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:06,076
You better hand
it over or else.

267
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,643
Hmm?

268
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:11,576
Now spill.

269
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:12,843
All right.

270
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,909
I was just walking through
the park this afternoon--

271
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,776
No, you were on the run after
stealing girls' underwear.

272
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,576
OK, I was running.

273
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,009
[girls yelling]

274
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,976
Hey, Ranma, catch!

275
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,409
Hmm?

276
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,309
What the-- Huh?

277
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:29,876
No!

278
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:31,276
It wasn't me!

279
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,176
[laughs] Oh?

280
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,243
Why you little--

281
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:37,643
Why are you yelling at me for?

282
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:40,443
Don't you know you're supposed
to respect your elders?

283
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:42,209
Oh, yeah, like I'm
going to respectable

284
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,376
an old freak who goes
around collecting underwear.

285
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,343
You want to take me on?

286
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:48,309
Hey, I don't have
time for this.

287
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,476
I've had just about
enough of your insolence.

288
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:55,409
Here, take this!

289
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,950
Ahh!

290
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:02,009
And the last time I saw
him, he was flying directly

291
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:03,309
towards Kuno's house.

292
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:04,776
[footsteps running away]

293
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,609
Hey, come back here!

294
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,476
Where do you think you're going?

295
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,276
Hmm.

296
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:09,909
Kids today.

297
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:17,543
--[laughs] This Christmas,
Ranma is all mine!

298
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,076
Shampoo no think so.

299
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:19,617
Hyah!

300
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,509
Oh, no!

301
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,543
I better put a stop to this.

302
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:32,084
Hyah!

303
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:33,009
Ha!

304
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,009
Hey, you two quit it!

305
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:39,984
Ah!

306
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:44,450
Ugh.

307
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:45,376
Ugh.

308
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,843
Akane?

309
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,909
Well, it seems
another rat has come

310
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,043
into my house to steal my Ranma
darling away for Christmas Eve.

311
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,009
Oh, I-- Who are you
calling a rat, and what

312
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:57,876
are you two thinking?

313
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,009
It's so stupid to fight.

314
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,243
It's pointless!

315
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:04,009
What's it matter where
Ranma spends Christmas?

316
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,909
But that doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

317
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,543
Oh.

318
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:09,809
Well, um--

319
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:10,676
TATEWAKI: Ah, Akane--

320
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:11,209
Ah!

321
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,076
-- --Tendo.

322
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,509
This is your personal invitation
to spend Christmas with me.

323
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:17,076
Kuno?

324
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:19,443
What happened?

325
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:22,343
I'm so glad you
asked, Akane Tendo.

326
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:23,609
Huh?

327
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,009
It was only hours ago that
scoundrel, Ranma Saotome,

328
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,943
dared set foot in the
house of Tatewaki Kuno.

329
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,509
So Ranma did come here.

330
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:33,609
Forget him.

331
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,243
For now you are all
mine, and that is how

332
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,943
it shall be for an eternity.

334
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:45,443
--[exhales] OK. first you tell
me where I might find Ranma,

335
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,743
then you and Akane can spend
quiet Christmas Eve together.

336
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:49,676
(WEAKLY) OK.

337
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:51,343
Oh, boy.

338
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:56,709
[yelling] Ugh!

339
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,409
Oh, Ranma, darling.

340
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,209
How wonderful of you to drop
in unannounced like this.

341
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:04,343
What a nice Christmas
Eve this is going to be.

342
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:07,709
Ranma Saotome, how dare you
barge into the house of Kuno

343
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,376
on Christmas Eve,
you unsociable rube!

344
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,743
Oh, that's going
to leave a mark.

345
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:13,309
Huh?

346
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,676
What the heck?

347
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,976
Stand up and defend yourself!

348
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,909
Not again.

349
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,543
Come back here!

350
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,509
Ranma, darling, don't leave.

351
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,276
Don't you remember you
were going to spend

352
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,176
a quiet Christmas Eve with me?

353
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,109
You coward!

354
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,343
[breathing quickly]

355
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,276
You cannot escape my wrath!

356
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,609
Hey, isn't that the
shop where-- huh?

357
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,609
Ah!

358
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,476
Ugh!

359
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:42,709
So, Ranma with Ukyo?

360
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,250
Ugh!

361
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,576
I'd say we did a
pretty good job.

362
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:52,876
I'd say you're right.

363
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,676
Now all I have to do is get
dinner ready for everyone.

364
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:56,843
You want to help, Nabiki?

365
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,409
You kind of make
it sound like we're

366
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,143
expecting a full house tonight.

367
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:03,476
Don't ask me why, but I have
a funny feeling that we are.

368
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:04,017
Oh.

369
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:15,643
--[exhales] I am
so tired of this.

370
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,309
That's so pretty.

371
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,943
--[groans] We don't have
time to window shop, Akane.

372
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,843
You better hurry home because
we still have to decorate.

373
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,509
All right.

374
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:27,443
I'll try.

375
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:30,176
And for your
information, Akane,

376
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:34,476
my Ranma going to be spending
Christmas Eve with Shampoo

377
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,309
tonight.

378
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:39,043
If that's the extent of
your reasons to find Ranma,

379
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:40,976
I'm afraid I can't
tell you, Akane.

380
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,143
Well, it seems
another rat has come

381
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:49,443
into my house to steal my Ranma
darling away for Christmas Eve.

382
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:53,309
That's it.

383
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:57,443
I'm so tired of everyone
trying to ruin everything.

384
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:58,509
MALE SPEAKER: Akane Tendo.

385
00:16:58,609 --> 00:16:59,943
Huh?

386
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,276
Ugh.

387
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:03,476
Tonight shall be the most
memorable night of our lives.

388
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,343
[bang] What did I say?

389
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,876
How many times do
I have to tell you?

390
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:15,543
Ranma [? honeys ?] not here.

391
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,509
As a matter of fact,
I haven't seen him

392
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,943
for almost a whole week.

393
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:21,443
That is lie.

394
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:24,909
--[laughs] If you were smart you
would tell us before we force

395
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,009
it out of you.

396
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,543
Why don't you try?

397
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,976
On second thought, I've
got a lot better things

398
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:33,176
to do with my time,
like find Ranma.

399
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,543
You're not going anywhere.

400
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:38,843
OK, what about if we do this?

401
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:43,109
We have battle, and whoever
wins spends Christmas Eve

402
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,843
alone much Ranma.

403
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,843
That is an excellent
idea for a commoner.

404
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,609
Yeah, do you have your
moments of brilliance,

405
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,409
don't you Shampoo?

406
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,376
Huh?

407

BOTH: Huh?

408
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:02,809
What are you doing here?

409
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:05,409
SHAMPOO: Akane want
to join fight too?

410
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,543
It would make no
difference to me. [laughs]

411
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,643
Ranma belong Shampoo.

412
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,343
Ranma darling and I are going
to spend Christmas Eve together.

413
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:23,343
[sarcastic laugh] Ranma
honey is mine, you hear?

414
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:26,443
I'm sick and tired of listening
to the three of you. [growls]

415
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,743
Do you understand me?

416
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,843
Unfortunately for
all of you, Ranma

417
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,909
isn't going to spend
Christmas Eve with any of you!

418
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,343
What?

419
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,709
Huh?

420
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,409
Maybe you coming down
with something, Akane.

421
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:43,943
I feel fine, Shampoo.

Akane!

427
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,309
Huh.

428
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:14,850
Ranma.

429
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:18,476
What took you so long?

430
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,009
I've been waiting hours for ya.

431
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,409
Hmm?

432
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,776
Oh, and wait a sec.

433
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:26,309
I even stopped and got you a
little something for Christmas.

434
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,943
I didn't have time
to wrap it though.

435
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,343
Here, you like it?

436
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:31,609
Huh?

437
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:36,176
Also a music box, and a--
and I saw these cool cards

that I thought you'd like.

439
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,076
What do you think?

440
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,809
Ranma, you remembered.

441
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,509
Oh, that's easy.

442
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,376
I'd like that stuffed animal,
a new blouse with a skirt

443
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,043
to match, a handbag,

to celebrate Christmas
Eve with you.

Dig in before it gets cold.

00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,243
I can't believe my eyes.

Neither can I.

470

Isn't it great we can all
spend the evening together?

471
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,376
And remember, Ranma promised
he'd be with me all day

tomorrow.

What you mean?

474
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:04,309
Ranma said he's
spending Christmas day

475
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,043
with only Shampoo.

476

Now, now girls.

477
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,909
It's not healthy to argue
like that on an empty stomach.

[gasp]

OK, Tendo, can you
stop the lecture

480
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:15,076
and just start
carving up the turkey?

481
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,376
Oh, and save me a big
slice of white meat.

482
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,876
Hey, I'm the one who
bought the bird, so I

483
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:21,443
get dibs on the white meat.

484
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,676
So now it's
suddenly your turkey

485
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,043
because you sprung for it.

486
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:26,343
What about the cranberry sauce?

487
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,843
I bought that too, Saotome.
