me if you want a refund.

167
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:46,545
-And how was that supposed to
help with our training, again?

168
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,211
It helps in all kinds of ways.

169
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,878
For one thing, we
learned self-reliance.

170
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,111
And in another, we use the money
to build our own Saotome Dojo.

171
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:58,278
-And what about being on our
own, indebted to no one, blah,

172
00:11:58,378 --> 00:11:59,145
blah, blah?

173
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,611
-Ah, if we had our
own Dojo, though,

174
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,711
we'd never have to worry about
money problems ever again.

175
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,478
-Why not, if it meant
we could eat regularly.

176
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,078
I'm sorry, the Panda
show is over for the day.

177
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:15,678
-Oh, my poor Ranma.

178
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,511
-Huh?

179
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,178
-But don't worry, darling,
if it's a mere Dojo you need,

180
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:22,711
I'd be more than happy to--

181
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,111
-Kodachi Kuno!

182
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,045
Ah!

183
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:28,011
-Ranma, darling!

184
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:36,819
-Dad?

185
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,211
You look sad?

186
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:40,911
-Who's sad?

187
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:41,778
Not me.

188
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,745
-It's OK, I understand.

189
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,611
You can't fool me, I know you.

190
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:52,178
Wouldn't you just
rather patch things up?

191
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:53,111
-Don't wanna.

192
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:53,911
-Don't be stubborn.

193
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:56,211
-Akane?

194
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,845
You've got a guest.

195
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,978
-I wonder who it is?

196
00:12:59,078 --> 00:12:59,845
-'Tis I.

197
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,845
-Kuno?

198
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,511
-What's he want?

199
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:04,611
-Greetings, esteemed
future father-in-law.

200
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:11,211
Tatewaki Blue Thunder Kuno,
aged 17, at your service.

201
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:14,578
-I'm sorry, but you're
no son-in-law of mine.

202
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:16,578
-Ah, but I will be.

203
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:19,411
I intend to take your
daughter to wife.

204
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:22,645
-Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

205
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,511
-Not to mention, forgetting
about right Ranma.

206
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,411
-But I haven't forgot.

207
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:30,278
How could I, when he and
his lay about father are now

208
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:31,745
residing at my home?

209
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,811
-They what?

210
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,878
-Are you sure?

211
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:36,845
-Uh, yes.

212
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,711
-Let's see you try this.

213
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:00,978
(LAUGHING)

214
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,911
-Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire!

215
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,378
(MOANING)

216
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,211
-Tell me, did it
ever occur to you

217
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:12,978
that you'd be better
off practicing

218
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,378
than building dumb gadgets?

219
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,478
-Ranma, darling, you
were magnificent.

220
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,345
-Ah, it was nothing.

221
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,145
-Does him like the Dojo
Kodachi built for him?

222
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,511
-It's OK.

223
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:24,578
-But--

224
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,411
-Like it, we love it.

225
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:29,645
How could I ever thank you for
the kindness, the generosity,

226
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,311
the fully stocked refrigerator?

227
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:33,811
-You needn't thank me.

228
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:37,111
As your future daughter-in-law,
putting a roof over your head

229
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,911
is the least I can do.

230
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,078
-Then as your future Pa Pa,
welcome into the family.

231
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,711
-Having you here with me
tonight, it's like a dream,

232
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:53,511
I tell you.

233
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,911
-Ah, the dream is
all ours, my dear.

234
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,111
We should be thanking you.

235
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:07,445
-Ah.

236
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,411
Now this is the life.

237
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,711
(HUMMING)

238
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,578
(SINGING) I'm just
a poor country girl,

239
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,045
with no place to go.

240
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:23,645
But now I've lost my man,
oh, how I love him so.

241
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:24,745
-Stupid show off.

242
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,545
(GRUNTING)

243
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,811
KUNO (VOICEOVER): Oh, what
an utter lack of taste.

244
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,611
I'd sooner fast than
eat those things.

245
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,811
To have enjoyed seven-course
meals, three times a day

246
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,745
as I have, and then
to be reduced to this.

247
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:54,578
-Akane Tendo!

248
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:55,645
-Huh?

249
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,645
-Once you are my wife,
you'll never again

250
00:15:57,745 --> 00:15:59,578
have to eat such
disgusting foodstuffs!

251
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,711
(GROWLING)

252
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,778
-We'll tear down
this miserable Dojo

253
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:06,578
and build a new future,
placing your father

254
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:09,345
in a position of honor where
he'll live out his remaining

255
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,345
days in ease.

256
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:17,511
-What a strangely
perverse young man.

257
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,745
-You could say that again.

258
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:21,945
-Psst-- Akane.

259
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:22,486
-Huh?

260
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,878
-Arrange for your dad to
be outside the front gate

261
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:27,645
tomorrow.

262
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:28,186
-Ranma?

263
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:32,678
Is it really true that you're
staying over at the Kuno?

264
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:33,219
Oh?

265
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,811
Thank a lot, dummy.

266
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:44,978
(PANTING)

267
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,445
-What's a matter, Pop?

268
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,178
Can't keep up?

269
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,178
-Speak for yourself.

270
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:52,386
Whoa.

271
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,211
-Is there something
I can do for you?

272
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:02,445
-(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, nothing.

273
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,645
Just thinking over old times.

274
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:06,578
-Old times, eh?

275
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:10,078
We've really gone through
a lot together, haven't we?

276
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:13,378
Through the bad times,
and the good times.

277
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:15,245
-What did I tell
you, it's working.

278
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,045
-Yeah, you're right.

279
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:19,511
-For example,
Saotome, I'm thinking

280
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:22,178
of the first time
you stole my pastry.

281
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,245
-Huh?

282
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:25,778
-Actually, Tendo, I
was just remembering

283
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,378
how you stole my rice crackers.

284
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:29,211
-Uh!

285
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,878
-Because you stole mine first!

286
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,478
-Only because you
wouldn't share it with me.

287
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,945
-You just can't let it
go, can you Saotome?

288
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,211
-Akane, didn't I
tell you to make sure

289
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,111
he was [? soft ?] up first?

290
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,845
-(GASP) Oh, no!

291
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,578
I knew there was
something I forgot!

292
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:45,145
-Ah!

293
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:45,911
You [inaudible]!

294
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,111
I specifically told you to--

295
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,045
-So I forgot!

296
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,711
Since when are you so perfect?

297
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:52,611
-What's all the fuss?

298
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:53,278
-Kuno!

299
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,445
-Saotome!

300
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,711
-Akane, you planned
this, didn't you!

301
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,311
-As if.

302
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,645
He invited himself, if
you really must know.

303
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:02,945
And what about you and Kodachi?

304
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,311
Did you think I
wouldn't find out?

305
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,278
-Look, that's different, OK?

306
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,411
-We're leaving, boy.

307
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:13,478
-But, Dad!

308
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:14,945
-A letter of challenge?

309
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:15,978
How dare he.

310
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,278
-If he thinks I'm going
to apologize to him,

311
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,411
then he's sadly mistaken.

312
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,811
-Why the nerve of that man.

313
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,078
He wants me to apologize to him?

314
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,511
TOGETHER: Well he'll
just have to think again.

315
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:30,211
Grr.

316
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:33,645
May the best man win.

317
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:49,945
-This may be the
last chance we have.

318
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,778
-You don't mean that
you wrote that letter?

319
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,178
-What else could I do?

320
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,445
I mean, they've got to figure
this out, one way or another.

321
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:00,011
-I wish they weren't
both so stubborn.

322
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:00,945
You know what I mean?

323
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,378
-Look, I know what
you're thinking,

324
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:04,811
Akane, so you can
just quit it, OK?

325
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,211
I'm only doing this
because of the old man.

326
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,345
You got it?

327
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:09,745
-OK, OK!

328
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,411
-I'm only doing this because
you forced me to it, Tendo.

329
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:14,678
You got that?

330
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,178
-I'm only doing it because
you forced me, Saotome.

331
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,678
Do you got that?

-Ah, note the exquisite form.

335
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,845
That's my future
father-in-law, all right.

336
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:45,445
-Au contraire, he isn't half
the father-in-law mine is.

-Excuse me?

338

-Saotome's School
of Special Attack,

346
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,845
fist of fearless fatality!

00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:19,145
-Tendo's School
of Special Attack,

348
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,611
kick of casual conflagration!

349
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:26,378
-Saotome's School of Special
Attack, slap of shameless

Oh, curses!

354
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:35,945
-I've got you!

355
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:39,778
Saotome's super special attack,
flight of the feckless firefly!

356
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:44,211
-Oh no!

357
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,411
He's fighting for real!

-Do over!

361
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:55,045
-No do overs, right Father?

362
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:01,311
-Oh, yeah.

363
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,011
I guess that means we're even.

-Say, Tendo, how's about
sharing some of that bean jam?

369
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,845
-Saotome, you glutton.

370
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:30,645
Look, you've got twice
the portion that I do.

371
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,011
-Don't be paranoid!

372
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,578
-Who's being paranoid?

373

-You are.

374
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:35,978
-I am not.

375

Hey, come back here!
