moving around like that.

no need for you to--

-Hmm, let's see.

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,466
I'll have to think of a
really cute name for such

a cute tanuki.

119

Hmm, now what should it be?

Hmm.

Oh, I'll call you Marianne.

KUNO (VOICEOVER): She
may be a half-wit, true,

not exceeds both Akane, Tendo,

yet another young waif.

130

What a scoundrel I am.

-Oh, the tanuki
turned into a human,

-I'm already human you--

KUNO (VOICEOVER): Wait a second.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,500
If I am a tanuki, then
she is a princess.

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,200
Her delicate sensibilities,
her maidenly innocence--

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,633
I must protect her as I would
the daintiest of flowers.

138
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:26,566
-Come on, Marianne.

139
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,366
Let's go home, OK?

140
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,533
-Now, there goes
a strange couple.

141
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,333
-What's even weirder
is how good they look.

142
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,233
-Bad Marianne.

143
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,166
Take us to your house, not here.

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,066
-This is my house.

145
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,200
I live here.

146
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,866
-You what?

147
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,266
In this big huge house?

148
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,300
-You should know
the Kuno family is

149
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,333
one of the wealthiest
in Japan, Mrs. Azusa.

150
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,666
-Well, there are a few
more wealthy, but not many.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
-Oh, I get it.

152
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,933
You made the house with
your magical tanuki powers.

153
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,666
-I am not a--

154
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:02,366
-I know.

155
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,766
Your name is Marianne.

156
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,366
-How many times do I have to--

157
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,833
KUNO (VOICEOVER):
Impossible wench.

158
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,666
Then again, can it be that
untainted by artifice,

159
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,366
my presence has the
effect of scrambling

160
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,000
what little wits the
poor thing has left?

161
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,333
Oh, patience, man, patience.

162
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,000
Rome wasn't built
in a day, and--

163
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,600
-So is it true?

164
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,400
-Is what true?

165
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,166
-Well, you know, that since
Marianne belongs to Azusa,

166
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,533
the house he built
with his magic powers

167
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,533
belongs to her, too?

168
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,074
-Yes'm.

169
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,633
That is--

170
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:37,000
-Oh, you impossibly
handsome rascal, you.

171
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,500
What girl stands a
chance against thy skill?

172
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,833
Let me be thy idol,
and thou shalt

173
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,133
be the envy of all thy peers.

174
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,566
Come to these arms and--

175
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:52,800
Where are you going?

176
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,200
Sasuke?

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,900
-It's a very sad day when
even Kuno the Clueless

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can't keep up.

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,733
-Personally, I
couldn't be happier

180
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,366
about the whole situation.

181
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,633
-How so?

182
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,900
-Well, for one thing, he
won't be yelling, I'm in love

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,200
every single time he runs into
us, if you know what I mean.

184
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,633
-That's true.

185
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,600
-And that way, I know that
you won't need to be-- [gasps]

186
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,566
-That I-- I won't what?

187
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,000
-That you-- [laughs]

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,166
-You're laughing at me.

189
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:27,800
-No, I'm not.

190
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
Really, I promise.

191
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:41,466
--[inaudible] Charlemagne,
Charlemagne, woo hoo!

192
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,633
-Come on, Akane.

193
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,933
Let's get out of here.

194
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:44,866
-Ranma!

195
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,533
-Gee, I wonder
what's for dinner.

196
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,466
-Ranma!

197
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,800
-Oh, Marianne, you're so cute.

198
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,333
-I am not your Marianne!

199
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,200
-Oh, Sophia, how cute.

200
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
You're so cute!

201
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,966
Oh, [? bridgette, ?] that
looks so cute on you!

202
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,800
-That's Mr. Scaly
Green, actually.

203
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,066
-Brother dear, brother dear.

204
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,666
What's that voice I hear?

205
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:07,733
Wha--

206
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,133
[laughs]

207
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,000
-How cute, how cute, how cute.

208
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,933
[giggles]

209
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:18,300
-And what can be the meaning
of this, brother dear?

210
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,733
-She's very difficult
to say no to.

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,666
-And what's your excuse?

212
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,433
-She's been so
kind to me that I--

213
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,033
[giggles]

214
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,433
-My Catherine, oh, my
sweet Josephine, my Maria,

215
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,433
oh, little Brookie.

216
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,666
You're so cute.

217
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,900
-Now, wait a minute, you
little-- those are my dolls!

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,900
[laughs]

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,900
-Not anymore!

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
-They are too!

221
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,866
If you won't give them back,
then I will take them from you!

222
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,366
-Give me back my dolly!

223
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,633
-Well, well, you're quite
persistent, aren't you?

224
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,500
-You too.

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
-But I won't give up my Sayuri,
Kazusa, Hibari, or Hazumi.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,133
-And I won't give
up my Catherina,

227
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,166
Josephine, Maria, or Brookie.

228
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,566
-It would seem my twisted sister
has finally met her match.

229
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,466
-Forgive me, but one's quite
enough for me, thank you.

230
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,666
-Quite so.

231
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:19,466
-Give me my Sayuri,
Kazusa, Hibari, and Hazumi!

232
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,966
[laughs]

233
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,933
AZUSA: Goodnight, George.

234
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:23,933
Goodnight, Katherine.

235
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,933
Goodnight, Josephine.

236
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:26,900
You too, Marianne.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,900
KUNA: Must I put up with this?

238
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,634
-Good morning, Michelle.

239
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,201
Good morning, Fantini.

240
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:47,267
Good morning, Charlamagne.

241
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,634
Good morning, Partos.

242
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,001
Good morning, Dartanion.

243
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,934
Good morning, Brookie.

244
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,901
Good morning, Raymond.

245
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,701
Oh, good morning, Marianne.

246
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,801
-I am not your Marianne!

247
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,801
-M- m- Master Kuno?

248
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,701
-I shall take up lodgings
elsewhere for now.

249
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:05,334
-Hm?

250
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,267
Mistress Kodachi?

251
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,067
-Marianne, let's go for a walk.

252
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,967
-I am not your Marianne!

253
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,334
[yells]

254
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:14,734
-What is to become of us?

255
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:22,501
-Can I at least
loosen the ropes?

256
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,801
-You know, I still don't
see why you couldn't

257
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,901
have gone out shopping
all by yourself.

258
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,267
-Well, it's not exactly my
idea of fun either, Ranma.

259
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,567
But Pichan couldn't come, so--

260
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,967
-And why not?

261
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,367
-The minute he heard the name
Azusa, he ran into the closet

262
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,701
and won't come out.

263
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,567
-So he doesn't want to become
her Charlotte again, huh?

264
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:43,467
-That's for sure.

265
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,734
-Speaking of which,
how is Marianne?

266
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,267
-And who's Marianne?

267
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,934
Oh, you mean Kuno.

268
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,234
I don't know, really.

269
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,501
Having a hard time
of it, I guess.

270
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:56,434
Well, you know how she is.

271
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:57,667
-I don't know, Akane.

272
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,701
I think you really
underestimate him.

273
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,734
Trust me-- once she gets a
real good look at that dopey

274
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,901
expression on his face--

275
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,267
-Speak for yourself, wretch.

276
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,034
-Ow!

277
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:11,575
-Kuno?

278
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,067
What happened to you?

279
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,534
KUNO (VOICEOVER): Drat.

280
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,734
It's bad enough
being dragged around,

281
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,167
but now my reputation
is at stake.

282
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,134
Also, if Akane Tendo should
happen to get the wrong idea--

283
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,901
Akane Tendo, it's
not what you think.

284
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,567
I swear to you, I
haven't forgotten you

285
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,934
for a single second.

286
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:35,334
-Actually, I wish
that you would.

287
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:37,367
-Hm?

288
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,767
Look out, Akane!

289
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:42,167
Who's there?

290
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,434
It's her again.

291
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,901
-Ranma Saotome, Akane
Tendo, last time

292
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:51,101
you stole my darling
Charlotte from me,

293
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,934
and now you're both after my
little Marianne, aren't you?

294
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,334
-Excuse me?

295
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,701
You mean my Pichan, right?

296
00:13:58,801 --> 00:13:59,767
-Whatever.

297
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,601
The point is, you
won't get away with it.

298
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,734
Accept my challenge
and pick that up.

299
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:06,567
-A sleeping bag?

300
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,534
-In the movies,
when they throw one

301
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,434
of those at their opponents,
it's a taunt, isn't it?

302
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,234
-That's a gauntlet.

303
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,234
-Anyway, if Azusa
beats you, then you

304
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,867
stay away from Marianne.

305
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,834
Is that OK, you thief?

306
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,267
-Thief?

307
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,701
Now you really
have gone too far.

308
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:24,301
Fine, then.

309
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,701
I accept.

310
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:26,967
-What happened to shopping?

311
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,234
-We'll do it after.

312
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,167
-And all for Kuno's sake?

313
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,701
-For honor's sake.

314
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:35,567
-Akane Tendo, my
darling, you do love me.

315
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,801
Ah, to mean so much
to two such beauties.

316
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:42,334
Scoundrel that I am, I
can't hope but he honored.

317
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:43,867
-Well, don't be.

318
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,334
-We'll use martial arts skating.

319
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,134
-Again?

320
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,801
-The match will be tomorrow.

321
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:51,934
And we'll use the ice
rink at Marianne's house.

322
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,967
-But my house doesn't
have an ice rink.

323
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,701
-Oh, but you will when you
make one with your magic leaf.

324
00:14:58,801 --> 00:14:59,501
Right, Marianne?

325
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,634
-I'm not a tanuki!

326
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,067
-Of course you're not, Marianne.

327
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,734
--[laughs] You may
as well be a fat,

328
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,567
shape-changing rodent for
all the respect he gets.

329
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:15,001
-Think again, Ranma Saotome.

330
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:17,201
Would someone who
feels disrespected

331
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:20,967
build a full-scale ice rink
on his property overnight?

332
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,767
-That's my Marianne for you.

333
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,667
-Fine then, I'll do it.

334
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,201
KUNO: Quickly, quickly!

335
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,067
-But Master Kuno, we
don't have enough--

336
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,367
KUNO: Then be creative, man.

337
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,134
Rise to the occasion for once.

338
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,834
-He actually did it.

339
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:50,901
-He can't have.

340
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:51,967
-And why couldn't I?

341
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,367
I said I'd build an
ice rink, did I not?

342
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,601
-Did he not?

343
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,501
-[laughs] Behold.

344
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,801
-That's my Marianne for you.

345
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:02,434
Here.

346
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,134
-I'm not Marianne!

347
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:07,001
-What are you doing?

348
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,001
Stop that.

349
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,467
Don't put your weight on it.

350
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:11,867
-Nice work.

351
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,934
-Well, next time,
you can build it.

352
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,267
-Welcome contestants to the
Marianne Skate-off Invitational

353
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,267
Challenge.

354
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,401
Are you ready to rumble?

355
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,134
-Be warned, Ranma Saotome.

356
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,401
Tatewaki Blue Thunder Kuno,
age seventeen, rides again.

357
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,734
-They don't call me Ranma
Skate King Saotome for nothing,

358
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,001
you know.

359
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,467
[laughs]

360
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:02,567
-I have the strangest feeling
we've done this before.

361
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:05,267
[bell rings]

362
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,401
-Remember, Ranma.

363
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,234
This is my reputation
that's on the line, OK?

364
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,367
-So you keep saying.

365
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,067
-Here we go, Marianne.

366
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:12,767
-Go?

367
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:13,334
Where?

368
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,001
-Ready, Ranma?

369
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,467
-Yeah, baby, yeah!

370
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,267
-I can't stop!

371
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,067
-Neither can I!

372
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,367
[screams]

373
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:25,908
-Idiots.

374
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,334
[gasps]

375
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,967
-Well, you've gotten better.

376
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:40,934
-Thanks to you.

377
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,801
-But from what
I've seen, it seems

378
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,401
your teamwork is just
as sloppy as ever.

379
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:46,534
-What is she--

380
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,501
-You remember the couple
cleaver, don't you?

381
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,901
Get ready.

382
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,467
Let's see if you can still hold
out against that [inaudible].

383
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,401
Marianne, why don't you go give
that girl a kiss or something

384
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,901
and teach her a lesson.

385
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,767
-Was there ever such
a generous girl?

386
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,767
Despite her love
for me, her heart

387
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,501
is large enough to
allow even Akane Tendo.

388
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,801
-Get ready, Ranma.

389
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,201
-Come to me, Akane Tendo!

390
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,601
[screams]

391
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:16,334
-That jerk!

392
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:17,701
What's he think he's--

393
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,701
-Once more, remember?

394
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,901
-Get her off of me!

395
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,442
-Ranma!

396
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,101
-And now for my own reward.

397
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,034
-And what have you
done to deserve it?

398
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:32,434
Honestly.

399
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,967
Hey, you over there!

400
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,001
What do you think you're doing?

401
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,334
-Maker, stop Akane, please!

402
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:38,875
-Aha!

403
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:45,634
[yells]

404
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,467
I can't stop!

405
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,401
I can't stop!

406
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,767
I can't stop!

407
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,334
I can't stop!

408
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,567
-See ya.

409
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,167
-I can't stop!

410
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,634
-As graceful as
the swan, behold,

411
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,634
the dance of the snow bird.

412
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,175
-Huh?

413
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,101
Snow bird?

414
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,001
She's invisible!

415
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,501
She is going to have to
try harder than that!

416
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,334
[yells]

417
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:32,301
-Ranma!

418
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,301
Ranma, Ranma, are you OK?

419
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm so sorry.

420
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,567
Please say something.

421
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,108
-Huh?

422
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,434
As if a kick from
you even hurts.

423
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,601
-Hang on, hang on!

424
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,801
-It was till you shook me!

425
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:51,334
-I'm sorry.

426
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,434
-Excuse me, but
have you forgotten?

427
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,067
What you've just saw
was my own invention.

428
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,201
Remember the goodbye whirl?

429
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,867
That was a sped up version.

430
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,001
-Ah, what's this?

431
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,334
Ranma Saotome down
for the count?

432
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,801
Does this mean they're out?

433
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,834
Speaking of which,
where's Master Kuno?

434
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,034
[screams]

435
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,934
-Also down is Master Kuno.

436
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,601
Has the match now become a draw?

437
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:22,234
Does this count as a ring out?

438
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,534
-This is more than just a match
if she thinks she can do that

439
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:27,701
to Ranma and get away--

440
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,401
-Actually, it was his
partner who did most of it.

441
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:32,334
-Now you've--

442
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,734
-You can't beat me.

443
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:34,567
-This is it.

444
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,001
The long-awaited death match!

445
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,034
-Marianne!

446
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,601
Marianne, where have you been?

447
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,234
You're coming home with Azusa.

448
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,434
-Don't do that!

449
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:49,901
If you're moving,
everything will--

450
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,501
-Now I've got two Mariannes.

451
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,234
-What's that shaking?

452
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,201
-This is it!

453
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,667
-Azusa didn't do it.

454
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,967
-Excuse me?

455
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,134
-Would you stop looking
at me like that?

456
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:25,101
I had no time, no
labor, no materials.

457
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,601
As if you could do better.

458
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,001
-How cute!

459
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:30,901
And here, and here, and here!

460
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:31,801
-That's it.

461
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,034
Forget my honor.

462
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,501
-You're cute.

463
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:36,501
Come here.

464
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:21,889
-How could you?

465
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,589
Do you know how hard
I worked on that pie?

466
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:25,956
-Ranma!

467
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:30,223
NARRATOR: Next time on Ranma
1/2, Ranma, you're such a jerk.

468
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:32,389
We'll see you there.
