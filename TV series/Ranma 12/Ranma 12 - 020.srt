Please Don't Say Goodbye."

DR. TOFU: By applying rare
Chinese herbs and extracts,

00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:12,108
combined with figure pressure
in strategic locations,

00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:15,008
the Xai Fang Heng
Gao Shiatsu attack

8
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,975
can selectively erase memory.

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,775
-So that's why you
forgot about me.

10
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,442
-Do I know you?

00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,308
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Unless
I can find Shampoo.

00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,575
AKANE: I'm home.

13
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:47,642
-Akane.

14
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:51,575
How could you forget
Ranma, your own fiancee?

15
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:52,342
-Ranma?

16
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,742
Who is that?

17
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,408
-Akane, he's--

18
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,575
-Take a look.

19
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,508
He's the guy standing
right behind you there.

20
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:02,575
-Hi.

21
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:03,708
-Who let you in?

22
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:06,442
Get out of my house, or
I'll call the police.

23
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:09,475
RANMA: I, uh, kind of
live here actually.

24
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:10,375
AKANE: You what?

25
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:11,208
-Oh.

26
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,442
-Ah.

27
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:15,242
So I guess the amnesia thing
wasn't an act after all.

28
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:20,608
-They can get to know each
other all over again so

29
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,908
long as daddy's little girl
hasn't forgotten who I am.

30
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,608
Huh, Akane.

31
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:26,608
-Do I know you?

32
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,575
-You don't remember him?

33
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:35,942
-Don't cry, Dad.

34
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,075
How could I forget
someone as special as you?

35
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,742
It was only a joke, Dad.

36
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,108
-That wasn't very funny, Akane.

37
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,442
-You sure fooled us.

38
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,775
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Well,
this doesn't change anything.

39
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:54,742
I've still got to find--- hey.

40
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:59,142
How can you joke around
at a time like this?

41
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,042
-I fool you.

42
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:07,542
I fool you.

43
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:08,908
Hiya.

44
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:09,842
I fool.

45
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,842
Yes?

46
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,708
-Shampoo.

47
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:16,475
Shampoo, tell me where the
shampoo you used on Akane is.

48
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:17,908
-Wo da airen.

49
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:18,908
You I love.

50
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:25,642
What you do?

51
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:27,575
-Do I know you?

52
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:28,208
-Not again.

53
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:33,442
-I wonder why I did that.

54
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,242
-A conditioned reflex.

55
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:40,808
-Somewhere, deep in her heart,
she still remembers him.

56
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:42,975
SHAMPOO (VOICEOVER): I don't
kill all memory of him.

57
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,175
This one strong enemy.

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,375
-Aren't you that cheer
they say at football games?

59
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:48,942
-No.

60
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,242
That's ra-ra.

61
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,242
AKANE: I know.

62
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,875
You're that 1985
remake of "King Lear"

63
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,675
directed by Akira Kurosawa.

64
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,808
RANMA: That's "Ran."

65
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:56,842
I'm Ranma.

66
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,242
-Akane, get out of the way.

67
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:02,742
AKANE: What?

68
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,175
-All right.

69
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,242
This is just what we need.

70
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:11,808
-Hey.

71
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:12,675
-Come on, Akane.

72
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,942
-What do you think you're doing?

73
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:15,442
-Airen.

74
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,942
-Hey.

75
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:21,908
Ouch.

76
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,342
That hurts.

77
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,042
Quit it.

78
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:24,875
-Quiet.

79
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,842
This is for your good, Akane.

80
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,542
-Let me go.

81
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,042
-Ow.

82
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:27,975
Ow.

83
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:28,475
That hurts.

84
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,075
You got it in my eyes.

85
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:47,708
You were a boy, and
now you're a girl.

86
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,242
How did you do that?

87
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,042
What's going on?

88
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:53,442
-Akane.

89
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:57,075
-Girl-type Ranma.

90
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,042
I give you kiss of death.

91
00:05:59,075 --> 00:05:59,775
Now you die.

92
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,008
-After all that, it
still didn't work.

93
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,408
-I guess not.

94
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,375
Look.

95
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:26,475
There's a label on
it and everything.

96
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:29,975
-Come and get it.

97
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,608
DR. TOFU: Hello.

98
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,042
Anybody home.

99
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:35,675
-Good.

100
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,675
He's finally here.

101
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:42,008
Doctor.

102
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,342
-Ranma, tell me
how is Akane doing?

103
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,075
-She's, uh-- I tried
using the shampoo on her,

104
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,942
but the dumb stuff don't work.

105
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,208
-Of course, that shampoo
didn't work on her, Ranma.

106
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,975
Why don't you take a close
look at the blend number

107
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,542
on the bottle?

108
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:59,542
-1-1-0.

109
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:02,308
-Blend number 1-1-0
is for erasing memory,

110
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,242
not restoring it.

111
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,175
To bring her memory
back you need

112
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,275
the bottle labeled
blend number 1-1-9.

113
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:10,342
-Huh.

114
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,275
Well, where are we
going to find that one?

115
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,642
-Relax, Ranma.

116
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:18,942
You see, I've got the formula
for it in this book right here.

117
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,442
Huh?

118
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:22,108
-Oh, Dr. Tofu.

119
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,375
Is it true?

120
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,342
Can you really cure
Akane's memory?

121
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:26,842
K-k-kasumi.

122
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,842
Say, Kasumi, well, what
are you doing here?

123
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,108
-I live here, doctor.

124
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:39,208
-Oh, oh, really?

125
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,675
-What are you doing?

126
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,108
-I guess you must have
finished dinner by now.

127
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:44,542
-We were just about to start.

128
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,908
-Then, I won't-- uh,
what are you having?

129
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:49,542
-Would you like to join us?

130
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:50,542
-Thanks for nothing.

131
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,808
-Girl-type Ranma, she sneaky.

132
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:02,008
She fast.

133
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:05,208
Next time, for sure,
Shampoo kill her.

134
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,075
-Hey, wait a minute, Ranma.

135
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,708
Where do you think you're
going all of a sudden.

136
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,108
-Isn't it obvious?

137
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,742
I'm going to a
drugstore in China

138
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,742
to buy some of that
memory restoring shampoo.

139
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,075
-Wow.

140
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,575
In China?

141
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:31,375
-What's that?

142
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,042
Going to China, son?

143
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:34,408
-Have a nice trip, Ranma.

144
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,442
I'd love a souvenir.

145
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,142
Hm.

146
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:37,975
What should I ask for?

147
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,842
Oh, we're all out of Oolong tea.

148
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,908
Buy me some, would you?

149
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,242
-Cigarettes and rice
wine for me please.

150
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,208
-Oh, and I'll need a
hand-painted tea set

151
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,408
to serve it in.

152
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,308
-I would just love a pair
jade earrings, Ranma.

153
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,242
Ooh, and one of those
Chinese silk dresses, OK.

154
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,175
-Oh, and Jasmine tea.

155
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,342
I could use some ink and
brushes for my calligraphy.

156
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,442
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Akane.

157
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:58,975
AKANE (VOICEOVER):
Why is this person

158
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,408
trying so hard to help me?

159
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:09,275
-Akane, someday soon,
you'll remember me again,

160
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:11,975
and I'll be waiting for you.

161
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:16,208
AKANE (VOICEOVER): I wish
I could remember him.

162

[panting]

163
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,842
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
The question is

164
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,308
how am I going to get to
China without any money?

165
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:30,608
Guess I'm going to have to
get there same as last time.

166
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,508
-Listen, Ranma.

167
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,542
A true martial artist can turn
any experience into training.

168
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:52,675
You must look upon this
journey here not as a hardship

169
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,075
but more as a
blessing in disguise.

170
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,942
-We're swimming to
China, because you're

171
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,908
too cheap to buy plane tickets,
so don't feed that training

172
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:00,408
junk.

173
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:06,275
It ain't a lot of fun, but
it's one way to get there.

174
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,408
How else am I going to get
my hands on that shampoo

175
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,408
and-- whoa!

176
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,342
1-1-9.

177
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,608
-Hm.

178
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:21,642
-Hand it over.

179
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:30,608
-Ranma, Ranma, why
you so nice to Akane?

180
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:32,442
-Well, let's just say
that nobody likes it

181
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,142
when they're forgotten
about, all right.

182
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:39,008
-Nee.

183
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,408
-Now, you've done it.

184
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,342
-Na-na.

185
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,775
Come catch if can.

186
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,508
-Give me that shampoo, Shampoo.

187
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:58,175
There it is.

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:58,942
All right.

189
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,775
SHAMPOO: That one is fake.

190
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:01,275
-Hey.

191
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,942
-Where is real one?

192
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:16,508
-Come on.

193
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,175
Give it here.

194
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,375
Shampoo, give it to me.

195
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,242
-Drop real one by mistake.

196
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:34,842
-Give it here.

197
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,642
-You want?

198
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,942
-You think you could
stop me that easy?

199
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,708
Well, guess again.

200
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,308
I'm used to women's bodies.

201
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,542
OK.

202
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:54,342
So you better hand it over,
or I'll get it myself.

203
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:54,842
-Hi-ya!

204
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,542
-I'm sorry.

205
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:02,175
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:02,942
I didn't mean to.

207
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:05,375
I-- huh.

208
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:06,008
All right.

209
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,142
Let's make a deal.

210
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,542
If you give it to me,
I'll trade you a favor.

211
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:10,975
OK, Shampoo.

212
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:13,075
-Really?

213
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,408
Yeah, really.

214
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,675
I give you my word, but don't
go asking me to marry you

215
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,408
or to kill Akane or
nothing weird, OK.

216
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:20,875
-OK.

217
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:24,808
Girl-type Ranma you kill.

218
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:28,842
You kill girl-type Ranma
and get 1-1-9 shampoo.

219
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,808
That is deal.

220
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:33,675
-On one condition, make
that half-kill and we're

221
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,308
in business.

222
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,875
OK.

223
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,508
-Shampoo no understand,
but is deal.

224
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:56,177
-Hm.

225
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,044
So she has no idea that you
and this girl-type Ranma are--

226
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,377
-One and the same person.

227
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,877
No.

228
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,210
Which brings me to the point.

229
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,444
I don't want to have
to ask you this, Ryoga,

230
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:10,444
but will you almost kill me?

231
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:11,677
-Gee.

232
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,544
I'd love to, but you'll
have to find somebody else,

233
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:17,344
because I've got Akane
to think about now.

234
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:20,710
From now on, it'll be a brand
new love story between us two.

235
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:29,277
Do you remember
Ranma at all, Akane?

236
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,644
-Ranma, should I know that name?

237
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,544
-Forget I ever mentioned it.

238
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:38,710
From this day forth, I'm the
only one you'll ever need.

239
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:39,610
-Ryoga.

240
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,110
-Akane.

241
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,610
-Could you bend
a little on that?

242
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,044
-Forget it.

243
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:49,644
-Come on.

244
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:50,610
I'm begging you.

245
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,244
-No way.

246
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:53,910
-You'll be doing me a favor.

247
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:56,277
-I said no, and I mean no.

248
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,377
-Be a pal and beat me up.

249
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,610
Do it like this.

250
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:02,710
-Is this how you beg?

251
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,644
-So you will do it.

252
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,577
-No way.

253
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,810
-Come on, Ryoga.

254
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,477
I'm asking nicely.

255
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,110
-So this is how you
ask for a favor?

256
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:18,877
-Well, tell me how else I'm
supposed to ask you then.

257
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,677
-When did you ask?

258
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,044
-Well, I tried.

259
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,544
I warned you.

260
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,577
-I'm going to rip
your stupid head off.

261
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,477
-All right.

262
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,077
Thanks, Ryoga.

263
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,444
I owe you one.

264
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:35,977
Yay!

265
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,377
Ah, you stupid jerk.

266
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,877
Now, who's going to beat me up?

267
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,610
-You can't fool us, son.

268
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,277
We know why you're doing this.

269
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,810
Since Ryoga is in no
shape to help you,

270
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,944
allow us to assist you.

271
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,777
Almost killing you
for poor Akane's sake

272
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,910
is an honor I can't refuse.

273
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:15,444
Thank you.

274
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,444
Thank you.

275
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:16,944
Thank you.

276
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:17,444
Thank you.

277
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:17,944
Thank you.

278
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:18,444
Thank you.

279
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:18,944
Thank you.

280
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:19,444
Thank you.

281
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:19,910
Thank you.

282
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,377
Thank you.

283
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,877
Thank you.

284
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,377
Thank you.

285
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:21,877
Thank you.

286
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,377
Thank you.

287
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:22,877
Thank you.

288
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,377
Thank you.

289
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,610
Thank you.

290
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:25,877
AKANE: What are you two doing?

291
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:33,610
You shouldn't bully the weak.

292
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,910
-We're not bullying anyone.

293
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:37,944
Here.

294
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,277
We should thank him
for his sacrifice.

295
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,744
-[scream] It's a monster.

296
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,177
-Hey, who's a monster?

297
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,377
-What a recovery.

298
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,810
But just who are you anyway?

299
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:55,944
-I told you.

300
00:15:55,977 --> 00:16:01,510
-Ranma, looks like we're
back where we started.

301
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,277
-Wha--

302
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,310
-From the top then.

303
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,077
-[gasp] Dad, stop.

304
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,544
If you're set on
fighting somebody,

305
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,510
then you can fight me.

306
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:12,910
-Hey, now, cut that out.

307
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:13,644
Would you?

308
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:14,510
-Now what?

309
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:16,110
You're too weak to fight.

310
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:16,610
-All right.

311
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,777
That's it.

312
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,477
Who do you think I'm
doing this all for anyway?

313
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,110
You are just so uncute.

314
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:28,577
Huh?

315
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,810
-That's it.

316
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,777
Ranma, do it again.

317
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,177
-You're uncute.

318
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,877
-Whoa.

319
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,244
Now she's responding.

320
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:40,777
Ranma, try making your
words even stronger.

321
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,377
Somewhere in her heart what
you say is having an effect.

322
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,844
-Now, that's
something I'm good at.

323
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,277
You're built like a stick.

324
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,177
You're face makes me sick.

325
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,310
Your thighs are too thick.

326
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,677
You can't even kick.

327
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,077
You're dumb as a brick.

328
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,510
You talk like a hick.

329
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,344
Your hair's a cow lick.

330
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:01,277
You itch like a tick.

331
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
-You cad.

332
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,344
How dare you talk
to Akane like that?

333
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,177
I'll make you take back
every word you said.

334
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,810

You're dumb as a brick-- dumb

You talk like a hick-- talk

-Ranma, you jerk-- you jerk--

-Oh.

Ranma, are you all right?

-Akane, it worked.

351
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,910
You've remembered Ranma.

Akane.

-Dad, I--

-It's a miracle,
the miracle of love.

I-- I can't breathe.

-Is girl-type Ranma
almost killed now?

00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:35,793
Shampoo come to help.

363

RANMA: Could somebody
help me please?

-Airen.

What you doing?

So that it.

367

You remember Ranma again.

You are stubborn girl.

00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,993
-I wouldn't talk if I were you.

370
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:56,493
-Hm.

371
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:57,759
Too bad.

372
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:01,359
If you now remember,
you now have to die.

373
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:04,926
-Stop it, Shampoo.

Come on.

You gotta quit doing that.

Hey.

-Just don't hurt Akane.

381
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:20,593
OK.

382
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,526
-Why not?

383
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,926
Is obstacle.

384
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,826
That is for killing.

385
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,259
-I guess I've got no choice.

386
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,426
I'll have to tell the truth.

387

RANMA: Ranma, are you sure
you want to do that now?

388
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:52,193
She'll only come after
you again, you know.

-OK.

Watch this, Shampoo.

-Girl-type Ranma?

00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,093
-Right.

393
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,559
I've tried to keep it a
secret, but that boy stuff

394
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:10,793
is just a disguise.

395
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:14,659
The truth is that I've
been a girl all along.

-Saotome, is this true?

-So you see, you and me,
we could never-- uh-oh.

-I kill you.

Kill you.

Kill you.

Here it is.

It means sayonara, farewell,
we'll never meet again,

-You're not going after her?

I bet you could still catch her.

-She sure was cute, Ranma.

415
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,793
I bet you're sorry
you turned her down.

416
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,126
-She was trying to kill me.

417
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,926
I'm glad she's gone.

418
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,759
-Then why do you look like
you're going to cry, huh?

419

-Akane, you are so uncute.

420
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,526
-So I'm not cute.

421
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,793
Big deal.

Who cares if I'm built
like a stick, or my thighs

are too thick, or I can't kick.

-If had known that you
were going to be like this,

425

I never would have
got your memory back.

426

-I wish you didn't.

427
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,726
I wish I never knew
that you existed.

-Oh, oh yeah.

429
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:54,759
-Yeah.

are we going to do?

00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:44,100
Out of nowhere Ranma told his
dad he was going back to China,

434
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,734
and then the two of them
got in a really big fight.

Why should I care where he goes?
