Too bad I have to leave on

No, no, please don't ask why.

Just know that I have
my reasons for leaving.

Akane, there's something
that I have to tell you.

[sigh] I can't!

32
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:30,802
A date?

33
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:31,569
Am I crazy?

34
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:33,435
She'd never agree to that!

35
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,435
-He doesn't look so bad.

36
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,402
-Oh, the poor kid!

37
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:36,835
-And at such a young age.

38
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,102
-What a haul!

39
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,235

00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,769
I've got it!

00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:44,569
What a haul!

43
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,702
-What was that?

44
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:52,602
Uh, uh.

45
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:55,369
Somebody stall him!

46
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:56,569
-All right.

47
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,102
Where did the pervert
run off to now?

48
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:01,569
-Honestly, I don't see any
point in going after him now.

49
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:05,269
-But Akane, we can't let
him get away with it!

50
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:06,435
-Don't worry.

51
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,335
He's not getting
away with anything.

52
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,669
First, we lure him in.

-Yep.

62
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,069
Can't be helped.

-Hey.

64
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,469
Don't you want to
say hello to Ranma?

65
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,669
Well, Ryoga?

66
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:38,235
-Well it's not really
high on my list.

67
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,135
There's something
I have to tell you!

68
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,635
-Oh?

69
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:47,135
-Akane, could you ever-- I
mean-- would you-- I mean--

70
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,202
-Go on.

Oh, I love these!

Ryoga, you really
shouldn't have.

77
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,002
-Have a safe trip Ryoga!

00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,202
let me give you a

young and all.

Come to mama.

-Huh?

95
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:39,769
What?

96
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,769
OK, just let me
get ready, my love.

Ranma, you are dead!

RANMA: Ahhh!

102

It was a joke!

103

Can't you take a joke?

I'm laughing to you?

-You big baby.

106
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,835
Is violence your
answer to everything?

-Shut up!

108
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,335
You're on thin ice, Ranma!

109
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:04,602
Plus, you're a pervert!

110
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:08,902
-Don't take it
out on me, P-Chan!

111
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:09,869
-Watch it, Ranma.

112
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:13,035
'cause pretty soon,
you may not have

113
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,035
P-Chan to kick around anymore.

114
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,202
-Say that again?

115
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:19,969
-It's because I have this!

116
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:20,735
Huh?

117
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,802
-Ah.

118
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,169
Looks like one of
your dumb maps.

119
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,035
-Hey!

120
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:25,802
You give that back!

[music playing]

122
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,369
-What is it?

123
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,802
-Give it back, I said!

124
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:33,735

[squealing]

130
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,269
NARRATOR: Once upon a time,
in the age of the samurai,

131
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,802
there were many
naughty foxes who

132
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,402
troubled the lands
hard-working people.

133
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,735
They stole food, killed
chickens, and generally

134
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,502
made a nuisance of themselves.

135
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,002
These foxes were very
clever and the villagers

136
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:10,835
didn't know what to do.

137
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:16,069
Until one day, a distinguished
priest arrived from China.

138
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:18,935
-Be gone naughty foxes and
trouble these good people

139
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,002
no more.

140
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,269
NARRATOR: He struck
once with his staff

141
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:22,802
and before their eyes--

142
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,169
-Lo, a spring has sprung!

143
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,369
NARRATOR: It was true.

144
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,435
All the foxes which
fell in the spring

145
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,102
took the bodies of young men.

146
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,035
And so, thanks to the
priest, the naughty foxes,

147
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,302
which had troubled the
people, were no more.

148
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:41,969
Of course, there was
now the small matter

149
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,202
of the naughty young
men to deal with.

150
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,802
RYOGA: That's the story anyway.

151
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,735
-Another Nannichuan?

152
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,902
You really think it exists?

153
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,035
-That's right.

154
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:58,902
Another spring of drowned
man here in Japan.

155
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:01,769
And that map shows
its exact location.

156
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:07,002
So next time we meet,
I'll be a whole man.

157
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,169
Well, I'm off.

158
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,769
-Hey, don't leave so soon.

159
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,669
I mean, it's already
pitch black outside

160
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,502
and you can get a
fresh start tomorrow.

161
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,435
That spring's waited
this long, right?

162
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,135
RYOGA: Sure.

163
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:17,735
Why not?

164
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:24,669
[music playing]

165
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:26,502
-I can get there fine on my own.

166
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:28,235
You don't need to walk me there.

167
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,569
-Come on, Ryoga.

168
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:32,035
You know you'd get lost
in your own backyard.

169
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,602
-Well, leave me alone!

170
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:35,835
That's why I've got this map!

171
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,469
OK, the arrow's
pointing this way.

172
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:43,969
Let's see, the arrow's pointing
east, so it's this way.

173
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:50,235
-East is this way, moron.

174
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,969
Give you a choice of directions
and you pick the wrong one

175
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,002
every time.

176
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,602
-Hey!

177
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:58,035
Gimme back my map!

178
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,902
-Giving you a map is like
giving a pig a pearl necklace.

179
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,769
That spring will dry up
before you ever find it.

180
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,569
-It's gym class next, you know.

181
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,769
-I bet that dirty old
man will come again.

182
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,535
What'll we do?

183
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,802
-Don't worry.

184
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,002
I think I figured out
a way to stop him.

185
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,469
Just leave everything to me.

186
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,335
-So what are you
going to do, Akane?

187
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:22,935
AKANE: Oh, you'll
find soon enough.

188
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,102
Just wait and see.

189
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,102
-I can hardly wait.

190
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:32,869
[humming]

191
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:33,802
-Oh my!

192
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,269
Where did you get
all of panties?

193
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,869
-They're a gift
from the heavens.

194
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,535
-Hey, are you sure you're
reading that right?

195
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,102
Isn't this the field in the
back of your high school?

196
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,802
-This is it, all right.

197
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:52,502
Look.

198
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:53,769
Here's the stone fox.

199
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:55,302
According to the
map, the spring's

200
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,902
exactly 100 steps away.

201
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,102
We made it Ryoga.

202
00:07:59,135 --> 00:07:59,935
Japan's Nannichuan.

203
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,869
-I don't need you anymore.

204
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,969
A mere 100 steps to
complete manhood!

205
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:11,569
Ha ha ha!

206
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,035
-That's no fair Ryoga!

207
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,902
-Don't follow me!

208
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,702
-Then stop running!

209
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:31,069
-87, 88, 89, it's
under that building!

210
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:39,969
-92, 93-

211
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:43,902
[crash]

212
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:44,902
-We got 'em!

213
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:49,535
-Where'd he go?

214
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:50,435
I don't see him.

215
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,569
-I'll bet he ran away.

216
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,602
-Which can only mean--

217
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,969
-That he'll be back.

218
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,735
Everyone!

219
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,335
To their battle stations!

220
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,935
We won't let that pervert into
our locker rooms now, will we?

221
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,935
-No!

222
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,902
-It's under the
girl's locker room.

223
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,869
(VOICEOVER): I don't care if
it's under the Imperial Palace.

224
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:15,635
There ain't nothing I won't
do to get into that spring.

225
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,935
INSTRUCTOR (ON TV): And one,
and two, and one and two.

226
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:21,202
Nothing like leg-lifts to
promote the bottom, ladies.

227
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,635
-Master, isn't it passed
time for your morning visit

228
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,435
to the high school today?

229
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,269
-In a minute.

230
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,835
-So, how do I look?

231
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:31,970
-Ranma!

232
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,735
I No!

233
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,369
You don't mean to go in
through the front door, do you?

234
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,569
-Well, duh.

235
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,369
-No, I won't allow it!

236
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,002
Akane's probably half naked now!

237
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:48,535
-The next time I see you, Ryoga,
I'll be a whole man again.

238
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:50,035
-Do you really
think he's coming?

239
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,369
-He'll come.

240
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:53,602
Like the sun comes up in
the morning, he'll come.

241
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,169
-I don't want to be mean, but
the only way to get rid of him

242
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,835
is to teach him a lesson.

243
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,902
-Don't mind me,
girls, I just forgot--

244
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:07,869
[splash]

245
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,469
-It's Ranma.

246
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,869
[screaming]

247
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:15,135
-Uh!

248
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:17,369
-Hey, isn't that Ranma Saotome?

249
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:19,935
-Ew, he's wearing
girl's gym shorts!

250
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,002
RANMA: Why does this
always happen to me?

251
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:31,235
Kill me now!

252
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,802
-I told you not to do it.

253
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:36,302
-I don't need you to rub it in!

254
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,702
I ain't beat yet.

255
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,902
All I gotta do is move
on to plan B, that's all.

256
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:45,156
[music playing]

257
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,090
-You got it, Mr. P?

258
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,290
Get the underwear and
create a diversion.

259
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,757
And while Akane and her
henchmen are chasing you,

260
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,824
I'll go and scope
out the spring.

261
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:06,690
You got it?

262
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,024
[squealing]

263
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,424
-Don't you chicken
out on me now, man.

264
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,024
Go!

265
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:15,757
Look!

266
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,657
It's P-Chan.

267
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,657
-Akane, P-Chan's here.

268
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,524
-P-Chan?

269
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,224
Where is he?

270
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,290
Come here, baby.

271
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:23,590
Come to Mama.

272
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,390
[squealing]

273
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:29,824
[laughing]

274
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,557
-What is wrong with his nose?

275
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,324
-P-Chan!

276
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,090
Snap out of it!

277
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:41,790
-You heard her Mr.
P, snap out of it!

278
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:42,390
Huh?

279
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,124
AKANE (YELLING): Ranma!

280
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:58,557
-It's not half bad being a pig.

281
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,957
-Ryoga!

282
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,724
You little-- what the heck
is wrong with you, huh?

283
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,590
What's more important, the
future and the spring or today

284
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,690
and Akane?

285
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,257
-Today and Akane.

286
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,394
-Aaah!

287
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,990
-He's fast, but he
couldn't have gotten far.

288
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:17,224
When I get my hands on
him, he'll be sorry.

289
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:18,557
Ranma!

290
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,090
Ranma!

291
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:20,624
-Oh no!

292
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,424
It's Akane!

293
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,757
Run for it!

294
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,657
-Ryoga?

295
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,557
What're you doing here?

296
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,424
-Uh, hi Akane.

297
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,024
-Gee, I would've thought
you'd left already.

298
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:37,457
-I uh, well I uh--
[nervous laughter]

299
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,290
-Hey, have you seen Ranma?

300
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,357
He must have come through
here a few minutes ago.

301
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,590
He just tried to get into
the girl's locker room

302
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,024
wearing some girl's gym shorts.

303
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,357
I can't believe it.

304
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,090
(VOICEOVER): Even if it
is all for the spring,

305
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,924
I can't be a part of
this sick little scheme.

306
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:54,490
Akane shouldn't have to
suffer just because Ranma

307
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,957
is insecure about his manhood.

308
00:12:58,624 --> 00:12:59,590
-Akane!

309
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:00,824
-Huh?

310
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:03,124
-You don't need to
worry about Ranma!

311
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,857
He may have his reasons,
but he's gone too far.

312
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,690
Please Akane, allow me
to be your body guard.

313
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:10,390
-Uh, OK.

314
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,924
(VOICEOVER): Huh, I've
just begun to fight.

315
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:28,924
-Hey, all right!

316
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:29,957
It's clear!

317
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:45,590
[scream] Huh, jeez,
they're so small.

318
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,224
-Caught you red handed.

319
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:47,890
Panties, Ranma?

320
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,557
You should be ashamed!

321
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,257
-Yo, how's it going Ryoga?

322
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,024
You trader!

323
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,924
What about the spring?

324
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,724
-Akane is more
important, you pervert!

325
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,257
You're nothing
but a peeping tom!

326
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,557
How dare you!

327
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,157
-Heeya!

328
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:07,224
He won't be bothering
us for a while.

329
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,557
-What the--

330
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,790
-You watch the door while I
pack up these pretties, huh?

331
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:12,624
-Hello, boys.

332
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:13,357
Am I interrupting?

333
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:17,190
-Huh?

334
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:23,424
-Don't even think about
running away, Ranma.

335
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,457
-Huh?

336
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,890
-Teaming up with Happosai?

337
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:26,890
I don't believe it!

338
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:28,157
You make me sick!

339
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,990
-Hey, hey!

340
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,124
Akane, you've got it all wrong.

341
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,824
It's just a coincidence.

342
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:32,724
Ask him.

343
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:33,857
That's not why I'm here.

344
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,790
-Ranma, They won't listen.

345
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,157
They never do.

346
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,690
Founding school of
Anything Goes Martial Arts,

347
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:42,590
final attack, silky storm!

348
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,592
Now's our chance, Ranma.

349
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,792
Let's run for it!

350
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,725
-But they'll never
believe me anyway!

351
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:59,225
(VOICEOVER): You can run,
Ranma, but you can't hide!

352
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,192
-Are we gonna let those
perverts get away with this?

353
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,625
-No!

354
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,225
-This goes from bad to worse.

355
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:08,859
This don't mean I'm ready
to give up just yet.

356
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,859
I'll get into that girls'
locker room any way I can.

357
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,159
Get ready Akane.

358
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,625
-Ranma, I'm touched.

359
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,625
You do care about underwear.

360
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,225
I'm so proud.

361
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,659
-I ain't like you, old freak.

362
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,225
I'm doing this for the spring.

363
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,192
Yeah, that's gross
enough, I guess.

364
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:29,825
-Ribbit.

365
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:30,292
Ribbit.

366
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,592
Ribbit.

367
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,225
-Sometimes you got to
fight fire with fire.

368
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,892
And this ought to burn them!

369
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,125
[screaming]

370
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,525
-Come on!

371
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,459
They're more afraid of
you then you are of them!

372
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,092
-Snakes!

373
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,059
Frogs!

374
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:47,459
Creepy crawlies! [screams]

375
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,459
-Hey, fight fair!

376
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,092
-Ribbit!

377
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:51,825
Ribbit!

378
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,059
[screaming]

379
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,025
-Ew.

380
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,425
You pervert!

381
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,025
Where is he?

382
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,625
[screaming]

383
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:13,092
-Ha!

384
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,392
I knew it!

385
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,025
[scream]

386
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,692
(VOICEOVER): Uh oh.

387
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:24,292
What's he doing in here?

388
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,992
-Are you OK, Miss?

389
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:28,092
Sorry.

390
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,625
I thought you were some
pervert named Ranma.

391
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,992
(VOICEOVER): Dumb
as a box of rocks.

392
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:33,592
Sucker.

393
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:37,825
-Huh?

394
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:38,825
-Hold me!

395
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:39,959
-Hey!

396
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,125
I mean-- I've never seen
you before in my life!

397
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,925
You can't just--

398
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,092
-I've been so in love with
you for months now, Ryoga.

399
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,192
Don't tell me you hate
girls with glasses.

400
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,059
-Yeah.

401
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,059
I mean no!

402
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,559
I, I mean I don't
mind your classes,

403
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,659
but I've already
got somebody I like.

404
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,359
I'm really sorry.

405
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,159
-Oh well.

406
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,359
Never mind.

407
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,192
-Uh, well uh, do you really--

408
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,292
(VOICEOVER): Time for
beddy-bye, [inaudible].

409
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,459
-Ranma?

410
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,292
What do you two
think you're doing?

411
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,625
-Oh, hi Akane.

412
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,759
-Hey, hey cut it out!

413
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:10,259
No!

414
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,059
Don't do--

415
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:14,025
-Uh uh.

416
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,592
Akane, it's not
what it looks like!

417
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,892
You know I would never do--

418
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,059
-Akane, why do you
always have to but in?

419
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,825
-Ranma.

420
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,325
You really want that underwear.

421
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,025
Now I understand.

422
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:28,725
-Hey!

423
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,292
You-- I ain't a pervert.

424
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,325
I'm just a-- huh?

425
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,259
-Here you go.

426
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,492
I know I can't stop you.

427
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,359
-Come on!

428
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,359
-Please.

429
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:42,559
I beg you.

430
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:43,925
Just let this be
your last perversion.

431
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,392
I didn't mind it when
it was just your body,

432
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,592
but your mind's sick too.

433
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,559
Even if it's just
for a while, I don't

434
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,392
regret the time
we spent together.

435
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,892
[crying] Farewell.

436
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,025
-Wait!

437
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,425
I only did it because
of that dumb Nannichuan.

438
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,992
What kind of sicko
do you think I am?

439
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:04,992
-Nannichuan?

440
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,325
-Yeah, like the one
in China, but it's

441
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,592
underneath this locker room.

442
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,392
-Is that true?

443
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,825
-Would these baby
blues lie to you?

444
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,425
-Then you're not a pervert.

445
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,325
-Nah. [laughing]

446
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,092
-You're just a liar, then.

447
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,792
How dumb do you think I am?

448
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:23,525
-That was quite a
touching performance

449
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,159
you gave back there.

450
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:26,592
What a fool I am.

451
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:31,092
I started to believe someone
actually cared about me.

452
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,159
OK, so no one said
they liked me before.

453
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,392
But why must I become the butt
of your cruel jokes, Ranma?

454
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:37,759
-Hey, did you hear what he said?

455
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,359
-Nobody likes him, huh?

456
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,959
-That poor guy.

457
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,859
-Hey man, I'm sorry.

458
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,159
-For one brief moment,
that girl with the glasses

459
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:50,225
found a place in this empty,
unconquered heart of mine.

460
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,692
Tell me one thing, Ranma!

461
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:55,059
Why did you toy with
my emotions like that!?

462
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,992
-Duh, Ryoga.

463
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,725
I did it for the
spring, of course.

464
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,792
-For your own pride, you ruined
an unsullied relationship.

465
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:06,325
Why you-- you [inaudible]!

466
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,059
-Yo, man!

467
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,392
Get a grip!

468
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:10,392
I didn't even know there was
such a place as that spring

469
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,192
till you showed up with the map!

470
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,525
-[gasp] Ryoga!

471
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,825
Tell me, is that true?

472
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,559
But why would you have
a map to the spring

473
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,625
of the drowned-- No, Ryoga!

474
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,525
Don't tell me that you--

475
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,025
(VOICEOVER): She knows!

476
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,325
The dark secret that I've
kept from her all this time.

477
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,092
At last!

478
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,925
She knows!

479
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,859
[squealing]

480
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:34,825
-[groaning]

481
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,025
-Oh no!

482
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,125
-Akane, I meant to
tell you some day.

483
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,725
-You didn't do it all for
that pervert, Ranma's, sake,

484
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,425
did you?

485
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,059
Ryoga, I could kiss you!

486
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:46,659
-Huh?

487
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,225
-Good thing she's dumb
as a brick, hey P-Chan?

488
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,959
-Who are you calling P-Chan?

489
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:58,625
-Whoa!

490
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:59,925
Struck a nerve, huh?

491
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,225
AKANE: Cut it out, you two!

492
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:08,192
RYOGA: Too late for that, Akane!

493
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:10,125
-You're dead!

494
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,725
-Quit it!

495
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,025
-Hey, I think I did it.

496
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,459
All right!

497
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:26,192
[screaming]

498
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,825
-There was a spring.

499
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,025
So he was telling me the truth.

500
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,025
-Ryoga.

501
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,325
That map of yours
was for Nannichuan.

502
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,525
Isn't that right?

503
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,092
-[squealing]

504
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,025
-Then why haven't I changed
back into a guy, yet, huh, huh?

505
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:45,992
Tell me, rodent!

506
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,359
What's going on?

507
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,325
Take a good look
at me, you moron!

508
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,825
Speak up!

509
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,659
You know I can't understand
you when you're like this!

510
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:59,325
Well, tell-- [groan] Hey,
what the heck is this?

511
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,492
-All right.

512
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,059
Which one of you
broke the water main.

513
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,459
-Uh, Ranma did it.

514
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,625
-The water main?

515
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,359
JANITOR: That little
punk again, huh?

516
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,825
(VOICEOVER): I
should've known there'd

517
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,992
be no such thing as a
Japanese Nannichuan.

518
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,925
Honestly, what does
Ranma take me for?

519
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:22,092
-Huh.

520
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,325
Weird looking pot to be
under the girls' locker room.

521
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,092
[gasp] Maybe that's
got something

522
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,192
to do with that Japanese spring
of drowned man, or something.

523
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:43,067
[theme music]

524
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,201
FEMALE NARRATOR:
What is this place?

525
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,234
Ranma and the others went
into it willingly enough,

526
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,534
but will they ever come out?

527
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,701
What are they gathering
all those urns for?

528
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:21,234
Next time on Ranma One
Half, "House of Gadgets".

529
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,667
Guests check in, but
they don't check out.

530
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,402
See you there.
