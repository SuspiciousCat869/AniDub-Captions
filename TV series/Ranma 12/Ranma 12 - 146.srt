Are you cold, Ranma?

Uh-uh.

6
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:55,988
I'm OK.

7
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,488
Thanks.

8
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,188
I'm sorry, Ranma.

9
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,822
I know I'm still
in training, but I

10
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:08,455
feel terrible seeing
my child suffer for it.

11
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,622
Ranma?

12
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:17,188
Yeah?

13
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,555
What is it, Dad?

14
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,355
Can you remember back then?

15
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,988
This is the first
time the two of us

16
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,688
have had the chance to be
alone together like this

17
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,488
since we came to
the Tendo's house.

18
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:37,288
I worked hard to raise you
as a strong young man, Ranma.

19
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,388
Hey, Pop.

20
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,722
Is this story going somewhere?

[wind howling]

22
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:46,122
We've been stuck here in the
storm for two days already.

23
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:47,855
And the only food
we have left now

24
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:51,322
is this one cup of
instant noodles.

25
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,788
One?

26
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,155
This might be a perfect
chance to show your gratitude

27
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,455
to your father, Ranma.

28
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,922
No chance, Pop.

29
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,022
Hm.

30
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,055
Well, in that case,
prepare to fight, Ranma!

31

Don't come begging for
a bite after you lose!

Did something happen between
you guys on your training trip?

Your dad's been totally zoned
out like that for ages now.

What's going on, Pops?

48
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:50,355
Just working out a
few things in my mind.

49
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:53,255
Ranma, get ready for
some one on one with me.

50
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:56,288
I need to confirm something.

00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:56,888
Hm?

52
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,155
All right, Ranma.

53
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,322
This is a serious
match, so don't

54
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:04,522
think of me as your father.

55
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,088
Give me all you've got.

56
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,222
Don't hold back on my account.

57
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,422
Start.

58
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:13,288

So what's the matter, Pops?

00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:32,388
You got the flu or something?

68
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,655
This confirms my worst fears.

69
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:35,755
Huh?

70
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:40,122
I've become weaker
than my son, Ranma!

71
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,588
What?

72
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,055
Oh, my.

73
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:48,422
Oh, those heady days of
victory-- back then and then

74
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,955
and here and here and here.

75
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:55,622
I was undeniable,
undefeated champion.

76
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:56,688
Hm.

77
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,355
Social Services would
love those slides.

78
00:04:58,388 --> 00:04:59,988
It would be a
fatal error letting

79
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:02,155
Ranma find out about this.

80
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,888
Must settle down.

81
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:05,588
Must act normal.

82
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,722
This must be a huge
blow to the poor man.

83
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:09,388
He's so worked up
now, I don't even

84
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:12,822
think he knows what
he's saying anymore.

85

[groan]

86
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,988
There's nothing to worry
about, though, Pops.

87
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:18,255
When I was five, you
scoffed my rice cakes.

88
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:19,855
At seven, you ripped
off my crackers.

89
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:21,622
And at 12, you
nicked my rice bowls.

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,922
And yes, you even
snafued my pork buns.

91
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:26,688
But despite all that, I'll
tell you something, Pops.

92
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:30,655
I don't hold any
grudges towards you.

93
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,355
Kudos to long term memory.

94
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:36,122
That's some grudge
against his father.

95
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:37,088
Training?

96
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,122
Yes, Tendo.

97
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:40,122
I've been defeated by my son.

98
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,988
I've let myself become slothful.

99
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:46,488
It's inevitable that
one's child will someday

100
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,688
surpass one's own
strengths and abilities.

101
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,855
But it's far too early for me
to be beaten by my son, Ranma,

102
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:53,088
yet.

103
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,788
I must remain a lofty
hurdle that he can't easily

104
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,888
clear in order to help him
become a great martial arts

105
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,222
fighter.

106
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:01,922
If you're that determined,
then I'll assist you, Saotome.

107
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:07,088
Oh, this is why
I've become so weak.

108
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:08,055
I can't lose again.

109
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,455
Why do you do it, Saotome?

110
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:10,355
It's not right.

111
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:11,222
You keep cheating on me.

Come on, Pops.

115
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,555
Quit lying around
and get working out.

116
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,422
I'll even be your
sparring partner.

117
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,055
I want you to be
like a lofty hurdle

118
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,855
that I have to clear to succeed.

easy on your dad, Ranma.

What for?

124
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,722
I deserve to give him some
payback once in a while.

125
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:52,188
You could at least wait till
he gets some more practice

126
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,722
under his belt.

127
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:56,555
Maybe I should show him
how weak he really is.

No!

Dad, what are you doing?

133
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,055
Not that position!

134
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:19,088
The Saotome Perch Position--
the stance of total submission,

135
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:23,822
indicating that the opponent can
do whatever he wants with you.

136
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,855
I know what you had
in mind so don't do me

137
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,722
the disrespect of
trying to deny it.

138
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,855
You want to make me give up my
position as your martial arts

139
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,222
trainer.

140
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,288
If my son wants to terminate
me as his martial arts trainer,

141
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,355
so be it.

142
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,255
I'll bow out gracefully.

143
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,588
What are you getting
all serious about, Pops?

144
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,922
You just lost a couple
times, that's all.

145
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,755
Besides, it wouldn't
seem right to kick you

146
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,322
when you're down
and out like this.

147
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,988
Oh, Ranma.

148
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,955
[snoring]

149
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,688
Huh?

150
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:02,688
You were going to
try and strangle me.

151
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,522
You were the one who was going
to deliver the coup de grace.

152
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,222
Thanks a lot, Pop.

153
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,022
I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night.

154
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,022
Huh?

155
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,888
Pop's gone.

156
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:17,055
"Don't try to find me.

158
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,688
Ranma, do you realize
what this means?

159
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:23,822
Maybe he ran away from Ranma
because he was scared of him.

160
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,055
But the odd thing
is that our father

161
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,155
has disappeared, as well.

162
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,622
Saotome, what's that
exercise supposed to prove?

163
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:35,922
What's it for, Saotome?

164
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,222
Tell me, Saotome.

165
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:37,888
What's it for?

166
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:38,522
Come on.

167
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:39,188
Tell me, Saotome.

168
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:44,822
Huh?

169
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:45,422
Mr. Saotome?

170
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:50,355
What are you doing here?

171
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:51,755
[groan]

172
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:55,755
But I wasn't out
looking for you.

173
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:56,722
RANMA: Huh.

174
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,722
I was wondering
what you were up to.

175
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:02,788
So you've run away to join a
circus, have you, Ling Ling?

176
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:03,355
AKANE: Ranma!

177
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:04,188
Ranma, please.

178
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:09,488
[groan]

179
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:11,788
Let's hear from
his better half.

180
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:12,588
Admit it!

181
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,322
I scare the wits out of you.

182
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,155
You wish, Pop.

183
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,655
Huh!

184
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,788
I have something to say, and
I'll only say it one time.

185
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:19,588
[scream]

186
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,655
Ranma!

187
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,355
From this day on, you and I
are no longer father and son.

188
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:26,355
What?

189
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:27,488
No, wait!

190
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:28,822
Saotome, that's
going way too far.

191
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,755
I won't listen
to your arguments.

192
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,855
This will be a duel
between two men.

193
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,922
And there shall be no
dependence between them,

194
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,388
making it the ultimate
fair and true battle.

195
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:39,755
I challenge you to a
match one week from today.

196
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,955
Is that clear?

197
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:41,955
Loud and clear.

198
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:43,588
This should be interesting.

199
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,788
Prepare yourself,
kid from nowhere land.

200
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:47,488
Count on it, prune
from nowheresville.

201
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,722
GENMA: You must have had
some kind of upbringing.

202
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,355
RANMA: Well, it's a good thing
you never raised any children.

203
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,022
[groan]

204
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,055
It's true.

205
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,455
A man's world is harsh, indeed.

206
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,688
Sounds pretty
stupid, if you ask me.

207
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,422
Ranma, do you have to
leave home, as well?

208
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,422
Are you seriously
going to fight him?

209
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,588
I have to get
serious about this.

210
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:06,988
Pops made up his mind.

211
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:09,188
He's determined to defeat
me in next week's match.

212
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,155
It doesn't seem
right-- a father and son

213
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,555
fighting like this.

214
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,037
Huh?

215
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,888
[scream]

216
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,855
Huh?

217
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:26,855
[groan]

218
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,755
He's going to regret this.

219
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:30,588
Ouch.

220
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:31,488
You're right about one thing.

221
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:32,655
I think he is serious.

222
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:39,955
[groan]

223
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,222
Hi.

224
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:48,288
What are you doing here?

225
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:50,755
So Ranma's left
to train, as well?

226
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,088
Wouldn't it be best
to just make up?

227
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:55,122
Is that what he wants to do?

228
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,255
No, but still.

229
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,288
Listen, Alane.

230
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:00,788
It's like I said this morning.

231
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:03,888
This is a serious fighting
match between two grown men.

232
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,422
It's different from the
kind of good natured scrap

233
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,688
we usually have.

234
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:09,555
AKANE: Yeah, I know,
but this whole thing

235
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:12,522
started with little
squabbles over food.

236
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,155
And it's probably
true that Ranma

237
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,722
took your last cup
of instant noodles

238
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,922
while you were stranded in the
mountains during the storm.

239
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,388
But it's also true that
when Ranma was little,

240
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,388
you stole his rice
cakes and his crackers

241
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,522
and his rice bowls and
his stew and shish kebabs

242
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:27,022
and a whole bunch of
other things, right?

243
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,822
Just call it even.

244
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,188
You're missing the
whole point, Akane.

245
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,355
What?

246
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:34,188
The time has finally
come for Ranma--

247
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:35,188
[gasp]

248
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:36,722
To take flight from my nest.

249
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:43,755
It's a happy occasion
and yet somehow so sad.

250
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:52,788
What a beautiful sunset.

251
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:56,855
[animal noises]

252
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:04,863
[animal noises]

253
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,651
(VOICEOVER) It's nice to be
all by myself for a change.

254
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:24,351
Come to think of it, I've
never been apart for my pop,

255
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,085
ever since I was a little kid.

256
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,751
GENMA: What's the matter, Ranma?

257
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:52,485
Daddy.

258
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,651
What's on your mind, Ranma?

259
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:58,018
You're so warm, Daddy.

260
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,618
[sigh]

261
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,485
[growl]

262
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:21,851
[scream]

263
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:25,518
That stupid old man!

264
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:28,051
He even plagues my
dreams at night.

265
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,118
Huh?

266
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:30,018
A blanket?

267
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,318
No way.

268
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:31,918
Huh?

269
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,018
So it wasn't a dream.

270
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,951
Pop really was in the cabin.

271
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,918
Huh?

272
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:41,518
[groan]

273
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,918
I can't take it anymore!

274
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:46,885
[echo]

275
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,185
[grunt]

276
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,085
[yelling]

277
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,385
Huh?

278
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:05,351
Hey, you!

279
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,318
Look out!

280
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,885
[grunting]

281
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,051
[laughter]

282
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,951
Young man, so did my show
of strength impress you?

283
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,451
A lot of avalanches
around here, so you

284
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,318
have to keep on your toes.

285
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,385
Oh, for crying out loud.

286
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,051
You threw that rock,
you stupid Pop!

287
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:27,251
Stupid Pop?

288
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,018
Hate to disappoint
you, but you're

289
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,485
mistaking me for another.

290
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:33,218
My name, you ask-- let's
see, they call me--

291
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,685
[groans]

292
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:40,118
You just don't know
when to give it a rest.

293
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,485
There's only one week
to go before our match.

294
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:44,385
What are you doing?

295
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,685
[groan]

296
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,951
Figures he'd try to interrupt
my practice and throw me off.

297
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:50,785
Boo.

298
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:51,851
Huh?

299
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,418
It looks like your
dad misses you, Ranma.

300
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,618
Hey, how did you
guys find me out here?

301
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,685
Saotome told us where you were.

302
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:00,318
He said he was sure we
could find you up here.

303
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,818
Huh?

304
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,385
AKANE: I know your dad vents
from time to time, Ranma.

305
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:05,751
But he really misses you.

306
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,785
That lame excuse for a father?

307
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:10,585
He kept on saying that you're
not father and son anymore.

308
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,551
But a son will
always remain a son.

309
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:15,918
It's not in your father
to despise you, Ranma.

310
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:16,518
Huh?

311
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:27,451
Look!

312
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:28,618
It's a real panda!

313
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,185
Hey, what's going on?

314
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,185
Let's get him.

315
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,751
[chatter]

316
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,918
(VOICEOVER) He's been playing
with that tire for a long time.

317
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,518
What kind of training
is that supposed to be?

318
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:40,485
Take that, panda.

319
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:42,085
[laughter]

320
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:43,285
[groan]

321
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,485
SOUN (VOICEOVER):
He kept on saying

322
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,218
that you're not father
and son anymore,

323
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,885
but a son will
always remain a son.

324
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:51,885
It's not in your father
to despise you, Ranma.

325
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,251
[yelling]

326
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,818
Give me a break, will you?

327
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:17,251
Show some self respect and
take off that stupid mask!

328
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,851
I did this for you.

329
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,718
I thought it would
be easier to fight me

330
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,551
if I looked like someone else.

331
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,651
[gasp]

332
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,174
Huh?

333
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:33,385
Forget to pack up your razors
when you ran away from home?

334
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:34,585
Huh.

335
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,985
Before this match
is over, you'll

336
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:39,851
come to regret ever making
me take off that mask.

337
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,585
What?

338
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,051
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

339
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,185
The Saotome Ultimate
Martial Arts Challenge

340
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,985
will now commence.

341
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:48,218
Start!

342
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,818
[grunts]

343
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:57,751
[groan]

344
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,751
[gasp]

345
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,151
[groan]

346
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,085
Had enough already, Pops?

347
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,951
Calling it quits?

348
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,518
[groan]

349
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:10,285
[laughter]

350
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:11,151
Huh?

351
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:11,751
Hm.

352
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:15,818
That did it.

353
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,085
I'm finally ready
for this match.

354
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,351
Now I feel like I can fight
you and resist the temptation

355
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:22,685
to hold back.

356
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:25,251
The spirit that's been
in my mind all this time

357
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:29,085
has finally started to emerge.

358
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:30,651
[growling]

359
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,318
Huh?

360
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,351
Pop's become giant.

361
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:38,618
Saotome's a Goliath.

362
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:41,051
He's summoned up all
his fighting spirit.

363
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,718
You can't scare me with that!

364
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:44,200
Ahh!

365
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:48,818
Huh?

366
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:52,251
(VOICEOVER) The
Cradle from Hell.

367
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,818
Huh?

368
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,818
[grunt]

369
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:59,951
(VOICEOVER) He
dodged my attack.

370
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:02,118
(VOICEOVER) What kind
of technique is that?

371
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,485
I felt something.

372
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:04,885
(VOICEOVER) The
Cradle from Hell.

373
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,651
So that's the trick
he's been practicing.

374
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,551
[laughter]

375
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:16,885
Huh?

376
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:17,551
Ranma's trapped.

377
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:18,818
There's no way out.

378
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:19,351
Huh.

379
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:20,451
Worried, Ranma?

380
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,918
There's no escaping me now.

381
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,285
(VOICEOVER) I don't know why,
but my gut instinct is to dodge

382
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:27,785
him for now.

383
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,251
At least until I find out
what that Cradle from Hell's

384
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:33,018
all about.

385
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:34,585
It's only the beginning.

386
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:36,618
This match will
last a long time.

387
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:01,251
MAN (ON TV): Is that
your final answer?

388
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,818
[humming]

389
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,018
(VOICEOVER) Three
hours have passed,

390
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,951
and neither of them
has moved an inch.

391
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,485
SOUN: To the
inexperienced viewer,

392
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,318
it seems that
they're not moving.

393
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,251
In actual fact, their
fighting spirits

394
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,951
are duking it out head to head.

395
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,618
This is indeed a silent
match, but it's very severe

396
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:26,418
and both contenders must be
on the verge of exhaustion.

397
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:27,418
Keep your eyes peeled.

398
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:28,551
Something's bound to happen.

399
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,018
Give it up, Dad.

400
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:30,618
Huh?

401
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:34,751
[groan]

402
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:36,085
Oh!

403
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,118
Ugh!

404
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,385
No wonder you weren't moving!

405
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,251
You were sleeping
with your eyes open.

406
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:44,718
I was just having a nice dream.

407
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,018
Those were the happy times when
you were still a young boy.

408
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:51,151
I almost forgot this match,
thinking about you when

409
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:53,951
you were young and innocent.

410
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,885
Ranma.

411
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:59,285
I'm glad you woke
me up for this!

412
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:00,251
(VOICEOVER) No!

413
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,918
The Cradle from Hell!

414
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,785
(VOICEOVER) You've reached
the point of no return.

415
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:07,051
[yelling]

416
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,118
[scream]

417
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,085
Look!

418
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:20,285
The Cradle from Hell!

419
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:21,718
[whimpering]

420
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:23,951
And here we have
the same position

421
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:25,518
the panda used when
playing with the tire.

422
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:28,818
But how's this technique
going to defeat Ranma?

423
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:29,918
Come to Papa.

424
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:32,385
Feel Daddy's whiskers
just like you

425
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:35,185
used to when you were little.

426
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,518
He's trying to get away!

427
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,051
Can you blame him with
the seven day growth?

428
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:41,285
Let go of me!

429
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:41,885
[groan]

430
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:44,985
No wonder I was
getting the creeps!

431
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:45,918
[groan]

432
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,218
[scream]

433
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:49,485
(VOICEOVER) That was disgusting.

434
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:52,085
But now I can finish him off.

435
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,918
(VOICEOVER) Come
to Papa, my son.

436
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:55,718
[scream]

437
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,385
Don't look at me like that!

438
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:58,918
[scream]

439
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:02,718
Stop doing that!

440
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:03,351
[scream]

441
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:04,051
Stop it!

442
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:04,951
Over here.

443
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:06,351
Come to me, son.

444
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:07,651
Get away from me, Pops!

445
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:08,218
[scream]

446
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,651
Hm.

447
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,518
It seems as though this
match is far from over yet.

448
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,518
This is the most ridiculous
excuse for a fight

449
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:16,518
that I've ever seen in my life.

450
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,318
So this is what they mean
by a fight to the death.

451
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:21,018
Let's hit the sack.

452
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,085
RANMA: Let me go!

453
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,651
[scream]

454
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,151
[laughter]

455
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,451
If you hate this
so much, then I'm

456
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:32,185
going to be reincarnated
over and over again,

457
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:35,651
and you'll never be able to
escape my prickly love embrace.

458
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,818
I am never going to have
a match with you again.

459
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:39,300
Ah.

460
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,867
[music playing]

461
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,056
GIRL (VOICEOVER): Bonjour,
mademoiselle Ranma.

462
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,856
You're Madame St. Paul
from Chateau Chardin.

463
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,023
Next time on Ranma 1/2--
Madame St. Paul's Cry for Help.

464
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,390
We'll see you there.
