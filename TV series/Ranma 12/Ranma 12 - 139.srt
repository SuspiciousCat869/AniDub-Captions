Hey!

00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,389
You're not getting
away with that, Pop!

00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,289
That'll teach you for
not staying on your toes!

What's your problem, boy?

12
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,423
Giving up already?

13
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,823
You call yourself my father?

00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:00,923
Huh.

15
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,556
I keep you in shape,
put food in your mouth,

and make sure you
don't get too lazy.

Oh, no, you don't!

RANKA: Why are you
always going out

19
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:16,489
of your way to get on my nerves?

20

This turning into a

is getting to be a part

They're at it day
in and day out.

Well, I'm done.

I don't even think they
want to turn back to normal.

What?

No!

See you later.

00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,156
Bring my notes
back tomorrow, OK?

33
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,056
Sure, no prob.

34
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,956
Bye.

35
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,389
See ya!

36
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:58,023
Gotta study hard for that test.

37
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,123
Yeah, right.

38
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,123
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,456
You sick or something?

40
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,823
We gotta talk.

41
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:07,589
Can you hang with me
for a little while?

42
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,023
What's with all the mystery?

43
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,389
I need you to do
a favor for me.

44
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:13,556
Why are you asking me?

47
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:22,723
All right.

48
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:25,623
I'm famished.

49
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,389
You needed me for this?

50
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:28,789
Sorry, Akane.

51
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,156
But when I get a craving,
there's no sense even

52
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,289
trying to control it.

53
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,123
One of the hazards of
being a girl, I guess.

Don't you have
any pride as a boy?

00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,823
Was it something I said?

58
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,656
You just turned into a girl so
you can eat a chocolate sundae!

59
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,056
Aren't you embarrassed?

60
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:46,389
Uh-uh.

61
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:47,723
And I'm loving it.

62
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,023
Get real, Ranma.

63
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:52,756
Don't you even want
your normal body back?

64
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:53,989
Yeah, sure, Akane.

65
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:56,456
But the cure's at
Jusenkyo, remember?

66
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,456
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,523
Hey!

68
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,723
Since that's out
of the question,

69
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,089
let's make a trip
to the cake shop.

70
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:06,389
Just feast your eyes
on my radishes, ladies.

71
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,689
You won't find any fresher.

72
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,456
I think I'll take this one.

73
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,356
Hm?

A thousand pardons, lady.

00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:15,623
Make way, please.

78
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,389
Very important business.

79
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:20,623
Oh!

the heavier it become!

Oh, thousand pardons.

but thank you, mister.

swinging that thing, huh?

Xiexie.

95
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:48,989
Will be careful.

96
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,389
I'm sure I've seen that
old freak somewhere before.

You him.

You that boy!

[scream]

102
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,256
Quit pointing, and
tell me who he is!

103
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:03,523
It's old what's his name.

104
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:05,189
Is he someone from
around the neighborhood?

105
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,523
[scream]

106
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,823
He's the guy-- he's the
guy-- he's the-- got it!

107
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,789
He's the guide from Jusenkyo.

108
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,823
You're the guide from Jusenkyo?

109
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,123
Not me.

110
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:14,923
I know you from somewhere?

111
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:15,623
Huh?

112
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:18,189
You mean, you forgot me?

113
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,156
Huh.

114
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,323
Why, you!

115
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:22,056
How could you forget me?

Ah, yes!

120
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,089
Now I remember.

121
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:39,956
Every year so many
boy fall in spring,

122
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,956
I cannot remember
every one of them.

123
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:45,123
But I remember you--
that clumsy redhead girl

124
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,456
with pigtail and panda.

125
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,456
Hey!

126
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,556
Watch who you're talking to!

127
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,423
Lay off!

128
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,156
So what are you
doing around here?

129
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,889
Finally you ask me.

130
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:57,789
Well, I come from Jusenkyo all
the way from mainland China.

131
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,656
And now-- now I must go.

132
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,356
Beg pardon.

133
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,723
Not so fast.

134
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,556
Wasn't there an explanation
you had to finish?

135
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,989
This ordinary tour.

136
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:08,389
Nothing more.

137
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:12,289
Do you always take a pickax and
a divining rod on your trips?

138
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:13,656
Digging my hobby.

139
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,923
And my hobby is none
of your business.

140
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,623
Hm?

141
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,023
GENMA: What?

142
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,989
The Jusenkyo guide?

143
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:23,789
[squeal]

144
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,889
Haven't seen him
for a long time.

145
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:28,156
He said he was
just here on a trip.

146
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,923
Huh.

147
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:29,989
You don't say.

148
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,456
So this is going to
be your big chance.

149
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,256
Huh?

150
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,189
I'm not following.

151
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,023
You gotta be forceful.

152
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:35,823
Forceful?

153
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,156
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,489
Don't you get it at all?

155
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,389
The guide's going to go
back to China one day.

156
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:41,689
Hey, yeah.

157
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,256
Maybe he can take you
back there with him.

158
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:43,989
Huh?

159
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,089
Yes!

160
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:46,256
The answer's so simple.

161
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,856
I don't know why I didn't
think of it sooner.

162
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,123
[laughter]

163
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,856
That's great news, Ranma.

164
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,089
[laughter]

165
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,356
So where's the guide at?

166
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,089
Huh?

167
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,656
Where is he?

168
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,123
I don't know.

169
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:59,789
Don't you realize how
important that guide is to us?

170
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,889
You didn't until
just now, either!

171
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:02,889
Huh?

condition of the ground.

Hm, the real reason
I came to Japan

00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,889
is to search for the other end
of the Jusenkyo spring water

If this pond's
connected to Jusenkyo--

Then we won't have to
go all the way to China.

So Jusenkyo can connect
to many other ponds.

and sparkling water flow freely.

00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,488
Solution now clear.

344
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,188
I consult lunar fortune almanac,
zodiac, Oracle of Changes,

345
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:41,721
and other honorable sources.

346
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,988
Also tried palmistry, tea
leaves, interactive divination,

347
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:46,854
and spin the bok choy.

348
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:50,921
Now I blessed with answers
and know when to open waters.

349
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:51,621
[gasp]

350
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:55,754
Two sacred waters best
joined on next lucky day

351
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:56,854
of Japanese calendar.

352
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:01,754
Nabiki, you seen Dad around?

353
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,688
He went to the training
hall with Mr. Saotome.

354
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:05,288
Huh?

355
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:14,788
Dad, Mr. Saotome-- uh, for
dinner, do you want a--

356
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,821
Oh, Akane, grab this
end for me, will you?

357
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,888
Sure!

358
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:21,321
What's this thing for?

359
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:22,721
Obvious, isn't it?

360
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:25,654
A decoration to celebrate
Ranma's Chinese curse

361
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,788
being broken.

362
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:29,821
Don't you think you're
getting carried away?

363
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:31,088
Hm.

364
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:31,854
No!

365
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:34,954
Don't pull that!

366
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:35,954
[scream]

367
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:37,921
[gasp]

368
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:47,188
AKANE: Marriage?

369
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,488
Jeez, Dad!

370
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,721
Is that what you've
been planning all along?

371
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,521
I don't believe this!

372
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:55,021
Honestly!

373
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,854
GENMA: Akane, can't
you understand

374
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,921
your father's feelings?

375
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:01,054
He wants his
daughters to be happy.

376
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,521
Why is it so hard
for you to see that?

377
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,754
Huh?

378
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,421
Uh.

379
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:11,088
I realize that I'm asking
a lot of you, Akane.

380
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,388
But the day that
you and Ranma wed

381
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:16,054
is a new start for the
Anything Goes School.

382
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,121
I've even lost track of how many
years I've waited for this day

383
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:20,454
to arrive.

384
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,621
But I suppose that it
means nothing to you.

385
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:25,621
[gasp]

386
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:46,388
[crying]

387
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,354
Dad!

388
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:50,754
[crying]

389
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:53,003
Akane.

390
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,136
Which isn't to say that I'm
going to go through with it.

391
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,003
Why not?

392
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:04,303
Told you she didn't understand.

393
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:09,170
AKANE: Finally, we can
have normal bodies again.

394
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,803
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

395
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:11,970
It's been a heck of a ride.

396
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:19,970
[groan]

397
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:21,570
We've had our share
of humiliation.

398
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,936
Hey, Ranma, you got
any special plans

399
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,936
for after you turn
back to normal?

400
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,303
Yeah, maybe.

401
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:35,070
Like taking a cold shower
without having to worry.

402
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,603
You call that a plan?

403
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:37,370
What about you?

404
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:39,070
You got something planned?

405
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:40,070
Who, me?

406
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,836
Kinda.

407
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,270
(VOICEOVER) If I don't
have to be a pig anymore,

408
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,336
I'll devote my entire
life to Akane--

409
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,236
a love life lined
with fragrant roses.

410
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,936
What are you
blushing for suddenly?

411
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,236
Ah, nothing!

412
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,503
Oh, I get it.

413
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,336
Too bad your days as
a pig are numbered,

414
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,970
because that's the only time
you can ever cuddle with Akane.

415
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:00,870
[gasp]

416
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:01,870
(VOICEOVER) He's right.

417
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,270
There's a lot to be gained.

418
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:07,336
But not cuddling with her
is a huge price to pay!

419
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,936
You got your whole
life to worry.

420
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:15,336
Soon Ranma no become
girl, even with cold water.

421
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,170
Maybe after the
guide changes it

422
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,303
into a spring of drowned
men, he could change it

423
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:22,070
into a spring of drowned
girl, then maybe you

424
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:23,670
wouldn't be turning into a cat.

425
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,370
That good idea, Granny.

426
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:28,336
Then son-in-law wouldn't
be afraid of you anymore,

427
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,603
and I'd be more than happy to
make you your bridal dress.

428
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,570
[gasp]

429
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,970
Shampoo so happy.

430
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:39,036
Once this curse is broken
and I've returned to normal,

431
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,236
Shampoo will be mine!

432
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,736
[music playing]

433
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:48,970
Then I'll be happy.

434
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,170
Mousse!

435
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,370
What you doing
outside Shampoo door?

436
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,636
You come inside and help.

437
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,570
[quack]

438
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:56,836
AKANE: So this is the night.

439
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,336
RANMA: Yeah, the night I
become an ordinary guy again.

440
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,270
I can hardly wait!

441
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:01,903
AKANE: Hey, Ranma.

442
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,336
Yeah?

443
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,070
How would you describe
what this day means to you?

444
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:09,103
Well, like I said, it's the
day that I turn back to normal.

445
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:09,970
That's it?

446
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:11,170
Mhm.

447
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,570
Don't you have
anything else to say?

448
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,703
Like maybe you'll do your
best for the Anything

449
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,736
Goes School, for example?

450
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,836
Nope.

451
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,503
You're unbelievable!

452
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,836
You still have no idea
how this change is going

453
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,070
to affect your life at all!

454
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,970
Oh, you're the worst!

455
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:27,736
What's her problem?

456
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,603
Wait!

457
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:30,003
You forgot your bag!

458
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:30,603
Hm.

459
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:47,170
I'm so nervous,
my heart's racing.

460
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:48,403
Yeah, mine, too.

461
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,203
Looks like this is
the moment of truth.

462
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,836
Water, water everywhere.

463
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,670
And all was cursed and black.

464
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:05,936
Drowned ones cast bad spell,
and out come pig, girl, duck,

465
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,470
panda.

466
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:11,736
Swirl, swirl, slithery pond,
and join with magic spring.

467
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,936
Swirl, swirl, dirty pond.

468
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,503
And rid the cursed sting!

469
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:17,303
Hear my prayer.

470
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:18,903
I beg you, please.

471
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:22,370
Now turn these curses back!

472
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,093
Huh?

473
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:33,559
Huh?

474
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,926
[scream]

475
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:41,926
[cheers]

476
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,193
Make way!

477
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:48,926
I'm coming through!

478
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,493
[laughter]

479
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:55,626
[groan]

480
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:56,493
Wait for me!

481
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:01,493
[gasp]

482
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:13,626
[gasp]

483
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,193
That worked well.

484
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:17,193
[groan]

485
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,393
[quacking]

486
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:21,226
[gasp]

487
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,093
[scream]

488
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:23,893
Why chant not work?

489
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:24,593
[scream]

490
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,426
Someone broke the
rope to sacred circle

491
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,526
before pond connect to Jusenkyo!

492
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,826
[scream]

493
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,859
That why it no work!

494
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:34,859
[gasp]

495
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,559
What a dirty trick!

496
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:40,659
How could you have done
a thing like this to me?

497
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:41,859
What?

498
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:44,526
Ryoga, you're the one who
cut it when you tripped!

499
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,326
Quiet!

500
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,559
Want a piece of me or what?

501
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,826
Can't you try again and
give it another shot?

502
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:50,926
It's very important!

503
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,626
Shampoo begging you.

504
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,959
All right.

505
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:56,159
Thousand year from now.

506
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:56,959
[gasp]

507
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,159
Next time identical
condition as today come

508
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,026
is 1,000 year from now.

509
