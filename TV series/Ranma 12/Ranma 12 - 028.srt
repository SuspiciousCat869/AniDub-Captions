Saotome of the Anything

00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,250
Goes School of Martial Arts.

6
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:44,750
And here's Akane of the
Tendo Training Hall.

7
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:45,783
-What are you doing?

8
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,116
NARRATOR 1: The two
have been engaged

9
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,783
to marry by their
loving parents.

10
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:49,983
-I didn't ask for this.

11
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:51,516
-Who asked you?

12
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,783
NARRATOR 1: As for the cause
of poor Ranma's suffering--

13
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,050
-What'd you do that for?

14
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,350
NARRATOR 1: When Ranma is
splashed with cold water,

15
00:01:58,383 --> 00:01:59,816
he becomes a she.

RYOGA: My dear
friend Ranma, I hope

18
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,743
this letter finds you well.

19
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,143
That's no good.

20
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,677
Hello Ranma, long time no see!

21
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,510
That's no good either.

22
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,743
Hey Ranma, how are ya?

23

[laughter]

24
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,877
-Now I've got it!

25
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,010
Ranma, I am training very
hard in the lowly mountains

of Japan.

27
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,643
This Friday--

28
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:20,043
-I will come to the Tendo Dojo.

29
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:21,277
Be ready, or else.

-Hey!

32
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,410
That's a formal
letter of challenge.

33
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:27,143
-That's one way of putting it.

34
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,510
-Let me see that!

35
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,043
-That boy has a very
weird sense of humor.

36
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,343
-Yeah.

37
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,743
A sense of direction ain't
the only thing he's missing.

38
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:36,177
-Ranma, Friday is today!

39
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,110
-So what?

40
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:38,643
What does that
have to do with it?

41
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,877
I'd give him another
week at least.

42
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,210
He could be practically
anywhere right now.

-One, two, one, two, one, two!

-Furinkan High
School, which means,

45
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,277
which means that somehow,
against all odds,

46
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,843
I finally made it!

47
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:18,877
This is the town
where Akane lives.

At last!

Just you wait, Ranma
Saotome, today, for sure,

50
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,977
without a doubt, is
the day we settle

-Hush, now.

It'll be over
before you know it.

-Hey, don't take
it the wrong way,

104
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:43,643
but I don't think there's very
much I could learn from you.

should change your mind.

why don't you just say so?

noodles Father likes?

your sister tells you.

It's not every day
we have sukiyaki,

and it's just not sukiyaki
without the noodles.

SAOTOME: Yes, sukiyaki
without noodles

126
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,843
is a day without sunshine.

AKANE: OK, don't overdo it.

131
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,610
You've made your point.

132
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,510
I'll go already.

133
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:46,110
Honestly!

Oh, that was close!

Bring it to Kasumi, he says.

What's with Dr. Tofu?

138
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:01,110
What's she supposed
to do with it anyway?

139
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:04,643
-Ranma, today for sure I'm
going to knock you to the ground

140
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,143
and make you beg for mercy!

-Huh?

142
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,843
-Huh?

143
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:14,843
Ranma!

-Ugh!

-Hey, Ryoga.

149
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:22,343
You're a week late, man.

150
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,510
It's OK though.

151
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,110
I guess it's pretty
early for you.

152
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,710
-It means you had another
week to live, Ranma.

153
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,410
I'd be thanking my lucky
stars if I were you!

154
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,343
Ugh!

155

-Ugh!

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,510
Ugg.

159
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,243
-Hey, I've got a delivery here.

160
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,543
-Oh, excuse me.

161
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,943
Maybe you'll be able
to concentrate better

162
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:43,477
once I get rid of
it for you then.

163
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,477
Yah!

164
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,077
Ugh.

165
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,543
This can't be happening to me!

-Hm?

00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,110
-Ahh!

169
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,510
-Don't you guys
ever stop fighting?

170
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,343
-Hey!

171
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,110
Don't look at me!

172
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,510
He started it.

173
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,977
-What am I going to do?

174
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,743
Ranma beating me is bad
enough, but in front of Akane?

175
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,043
-Gee, Akane, I bet
you miss P-chan.

176
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:21,877
Want to see him?

177
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,477
-Huh?

178
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,710
Yes, of course.

179
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:24,843
Do you know where he is?

180
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,077
-He's closer than you think.

181
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,777
-Ahh!

182
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,843
-Hah, scared you, didn't I?

183
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:33,943
-Turn to the right.

184
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:34,577
-Huh?

185
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,877
-Turn right!

186
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,643
You shouldn't bully the weak!

187
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:43,343
Honestly, he's such
a jerk sometimes.

188
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:47,043
I can't believe he was
picking on you like that!

189
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,843
Ryoga, I think it
would be better

190
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:50,377
to stay out of Ranma's way.

191
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,677
He's been fighting with
Shampoo's great-grandmother

192
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,643
while you were gone.

193
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,643
He's gotten a lot better.

194
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:59,977
Next time he challenges
you, just ignore him, OK?

195
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,210
You promise?

196
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:02,943
Ryoga?

197
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,843
-Mhm?

198
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:07,977
-OK?

199
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,643
-Oh no, Akane, please
don't look at me like that!

200
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,577
Please don't pity me!

201
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,643
-Ryoga, wait!

202
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:17,877
-I can't figure it out.

203
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,477
He said he was hard
at work, training

204
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,010
in the mountains of Japan.

205
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:24,110
There's no way I should've
beat him that easy.

206
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:28,577
Not unless, hey, maybe
it's not Ryoga at all.

207
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,577
Maybe it's me.

208
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,577
-Foolish boy!

209
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,310
Your arrogance is beyond belief!

210
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,910
-Keep your voice down, will you?

211
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:38,910
I know it sounds stupid, but
that's why I asked you, Pop.

212
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:42,577
-If you're set on proving
yourself, why not try me?

213
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,677
RANMA: Maybe I will!

214
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,210
GENMA: Anytime, boy.

215
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,643
You've got to know
your limitations, boy.

216
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,510
Nobody likes a martial
artist with a bad attitude.

217
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,843
You need some
spiritual training.

218
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:59,743
But first our stomachs are
in need of some sukiyaki.

219
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:01,210
-Sorry, too late!

220
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,243
-What?

221
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,443
You mean, you didn't save some?

222
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:04,843
-Girls, wasn't that good?

223
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:06,343
-Yeah, it was great.

224
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:07,877
-Stop that, you
saved some, right?

225
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,810
-Hey, what about me, huh?

226
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,210
-Look, Saotome, we left
you plenty of noodles.

227
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:14,343
Weren't you just saying
they're your favorite?

228
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:15,443
Hm?

229
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:16,043
-Ugh.

230
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,177
[screaming]

231
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,243
-Curse you, Ranma!

232
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:32,377
-Looks like you've had a
rough time of it, sonny boy.

233
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,110
Still think this old gal's
got nothing to teach you?

234
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:39,877
-I was just hoping you'd show
up again sooner or later.

235
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,689
-Haha.

236
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:09,240
-Hi-yah!

237
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:12,873
How'd I end up here doing
something like this anyway?

238
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,307
It's your duty to
accompany Ranma and do

239
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,573
all of the cooking.

240
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,740
-It's also good bridal
training, Akane.

241
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:25,107
-After all, you're
going to be his wife.

242
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,007
-Duty, he says.

243
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,107
Bridal training, she says.

244
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,473
Honestly!

245
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,073
Hi-yah!

246
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:37,540
-Why didn't you say
something, old man?

247
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:41,373
You know I can't concentrate
with some girl around.

248
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,207
Why you stupid-- huh?

249
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,873
-Yeah, right.

250
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:50,940
Look who's talking.

251
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,273
Hm.

252
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:14,240
I'd like to know
who's training who.

253
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,307
Uh!

254
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,007
-Son-in-law, are you
in training as well?

255
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,240
-How long have you
been here, you ghoul!

256
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:23,807
-Calm down, sonny boy.

257
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,307
I'm not here to interfere
with you, you know.

258
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,440
-Huh?

259
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,573
-Believe it or not, I'm
hoping you'll succeed.

260
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,440
Because you're going to need
all the help you can get.

261
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,707
-Now what?

262
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,040
-I'll be looking forward
to it, son-in-law.

263
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:36,607
-Hey!

264
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,107
-See you soon!

265
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,807
-So you're sure that I'll
be able to defeat Ranma

266
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,673
with this special
technique of yours?

267
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,073
-Of course.

268
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,207
Although whether you'll be
able to master it or not

269
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,573
is another story.

270
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:51,873
-I'll master it!

271
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:54,207
If it means I'll be
able to defeat Ranma,

272
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,073
I'll master any technique,
no matter how difficult!

273
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,973
-Then watch this, sonny boy!

274
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,707
-She's catching fish without
getting her hands wet.

275
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,807
Incredible!

276
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,740
-What you just saw was
my son-in-law's chestnuts

277
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,907
roasting on an open
fire technique.

278
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,307
If you want a chance
at Ranma, you'll

279
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,373
have to master this
technique as well.

280
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,607
-What's the big deal?

281
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,473
If Ranma can do it,
then I can do it.

282
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:27,073
Watch.

283
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:38,440
[squeal]

284
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,240
-Now, try again.

285
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,640
RANMA: Hey, she's making curry?

286
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,040
Great!

287
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:50,973
GENMA: Now, aren't you
glad we brought her, boy?

288
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,240
RANMA: Hurry it up, Akane!

289
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:52,873
-Slow down!

290
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,440
What's the hurry?

291
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,673
You don't want to eat it all
before the full flavor emerges,

292
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:57,907
now do you?

293
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,107
-No, he wouldn't want that.

294
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,573
And besides, we
trained so hard today,

295
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:02,940
I feel faint with hunger.

296
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:04,640
-Me too, I'm starving!

297
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,873
-OK, OK!

298
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,473
Well, I hope that it tastes OK.

299
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:17,573
Here you go!

300
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:20,773
-Ah, Mother nature's food
made with mother nature's

301
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:25,507
ingredients served in mother
nature's own backyard.

302
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,673
And what a rare
and unusual aroma

303
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,207
tickles at my nose,
my dear Akane.

304
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,740
-Mr. Saotome, you smelled
the white wine I used.

305
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,040
-White wine?

306
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:38,573
Are you supposed to
put that junk in here?

307
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:42,007
-It sure is a good thing we
brought Akane along, isn't it,

308
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,373
boy?

309
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,773
-Maybe you should taste
it first, Mr. Saotome.

310
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,540
-Ah, don't worry
about it, Akane.

311
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,573
We're so hungry, we could
eat pig slop if we had to.

312
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,340
Haha.

313
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,307
-Excuse me?

314
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,973
-Oh, nothing.

315
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,440
-Well, then, dig in!

316
00:15:58,473 --> 00:15:59,940
-Well, here goes nothing.

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,740
-You like it?

318
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,073
-All right, boy.

319
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,307
Enough time wasted, we
must continue to train!

320
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,640
-Right!

321
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,840
-Uh, thanks for the meal!

322
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,940
-Uh, thanks!

323
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,807
-Now, what'd I do?

324
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,140
Now that's strange.

325
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,940
I wonder if I put
too much wine in it?

326
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,140
Vinegar?

327
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,440
-I told you, we shouldn't
have brought her!

328
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,573
-Who could've known she'd
be that poor a cook.

329
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,240
It's inhumane, I tell you!

330
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,740
-You'll have to fend
for yourself in the food

331
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,907
department.

332
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,907
Think of it as
building discipline.

333
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,173
-She forgot I'm used to
training in the mountains.

334
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,140
Catching my own dinner's
a piece of cake!

335
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,040
-So I confused vinegar
and white wine.

336
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,107
They didn't have to make
such a big deal about it.

337
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,640
I did them a favor
by cooking, didn't I?

338
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,973
Ranma, you're such a jerk!

339
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,873
Ryoga!

340
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,507
-Oh man, I'm starving to death!

341
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,173
You're lucky, Pop!

342
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:26,207
I wish I could turn into a panda
and stuff myself with bamboo.

343
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,007
Ah, shut up, I can't eat that!

344
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:38,407
Yeah, yeah, right.

345
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,707
I'm probably the only
person in the world

346
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,640
who could eat that
disgusting junk.

347
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:43,273
How pathetic.

348
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,207
-I see, so you're out
here training also.

349
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,340
Is that it, Ryoga?

350
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,840
-Well, I have to.

351
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,640
You saw what happened
to me back there.

352
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,240
-Now, this might be
a little bit better.

353
00:17:56,273 --> 00:18:00,173
I've added some things
which might help its flavor.

354
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:00,807
Here you go.

355
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,607
I hope it's good!

356
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,240
-Bet it is.

357
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,807
Oh, it's good to be alive.

358
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,473
Imagine me, eating a
home-cooked meal by Akane!

359
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm the happiest
guy in the world!

360
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,040
OK, here I go!

361
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,107
-It's still bad, right?

362
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,107
-It's delicious!

363
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:36,673
I, I, I've never had
such delicious food

364
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,307
in my entire life!

365
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,673
-Great!

366
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:42,707
Then, the mayonnaise, sugar,
and horseradish did help then!

367
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,973
Huh?

368
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:48,473
-Uh, Ryoga, is your sense
of taste messed up too?

369
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:49,640
-Hey!

370
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,973
I didn't ask for
your opinion, Ranma!

371
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,207
-Ugh, Akane, have you
tried tasting it yet?

372
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,507
-No, not yet.

373
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,040
-Then you try some of it.

374
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,373
Go on!

375
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,640
-Are you trying to say it's bad?

376
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:00,240
-Uh-huh.

377
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,107
-I won't allow you to
talk to her that way.

378
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,540
-What are you going
to do about it?

379
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,507
-I'm going to shut that
rude mouth of your for good!

380
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,907
-It's OK, Ryoga.

381
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm glad that you like my
cooking and everything,

382
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,973
but you don't have to defend me.

383
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,207
-I'd listen to her
if I were you, Ryoga.

384
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,173
Besides, you know I
hate bullying the weak.

385
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:22,373
-So I'm weak, huh?

386
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,407
-Hey, what the?

387
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,507
Old ghoul?

388
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,840
-Ryoga!

389
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,173
Ryoga, you OK?

390
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,507
-Akane?

391
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,040
Ugh.

392
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:41,140
-Haha.

393
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:43,807
One week from now, we'll
continue the match.

394
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,140
You got that?

395
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:47,973
You have just one week
to prepare, son-in-law.

396
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,107
Haha.

397
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,707
He'll be much stronger
when you next see him.

398
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,473
Hahah.

399
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,173
-Please, wait!

400
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,873
-Uh, Akane?

401
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,040
-Why should I stay?

402
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,440
You can't eat my
cooking, remember?

403
00:19:58,473 --> 00:19:59,573
-Oh, that's right.

404
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,440
Nobody human could
eat that stuff.

405
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:04,607
Ryoga, maybe, but he don't
count as human, now does he?

406
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
-You won't miss me
when I'm gone then!

407
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,807
-Geez.

408
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,007
Have it your way.

409
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,440
-Listen, old woman.

410
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:16,107
I don't need your fancy tricks.

411
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,873
I could beat Ranma
just with my fists!

412
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,673
-I admire your attitude,
but it's not enough.

413
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:23,473
I want you to do
something for me.

414
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:26,140
Can you shatter this boulder?

415
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:26,673
-Hah.

416
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:27,307
That's easy.

417
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,140
-Aren't you listening to me?

418
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,673
I said shatter, not
split, you fool!

419
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:45,273
Watch!

420
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,107
-Incredible!

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
-Bakusai Tenketsu?

425
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:13,007
-Can I defeat Ranma
using the Breaking Point?

426
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,173
-Well, now, shall
I teach it to you?

-Oh, would you?

Oh, please.

429
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,273
If it helps me defeat
Ranma, I'll do anything!

430
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:22,673
Please, teach it to me.

431
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:23,840
-What a powerful technique!

432
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,040
If Ryoga does
manage to master it,

433
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,807
what does that mean for Ranma?

That's fine, but why do
I have to be the prize?

438
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,128
Just leave me out
of it, will you?
