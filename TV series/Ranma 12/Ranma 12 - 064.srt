00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,008
-Oh sure, he'll do anything
to annoy the students.

171
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:13,042
-Hey, let's get while
the getting's good, huh?

172
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,242
-Now he's gonna pay for sure.

173
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:16,675
To the Principal's office!

174
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,442
-Yeah, he can't just
make us get buzzcuts.

175
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:19,408
-Or bowl cuts either.

176
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,408
-Where is the Principal's
office anyway?

177
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,875
Ever since I transferred
here, I haven't had a chance

178
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,375
to go there yet.

179
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,375
-You haven't?

180
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,375
-Me either.

181
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,375
-Or me, for that matter.

182
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:32,842
-Hasn't anyone been there?

183
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,142
-Fear not, fellow students.

184
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:37,508
So long as Tatewaki Kuno is
enrolled at Furikan High,

185
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,708
the institution of
buzzcuts and bowl cuts

186
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:43,075
shall never become a reality.

187
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,508
Stand and delivery,
perverted Principal.

188
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,975
-Who are you calling a pervert?

189
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,342
-We found it.

190
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:55,142
-All right!

191
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,208
Way t to go.

192
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:58,742
-Hey, there's a Principal
office here too.

193
00:08:58,842 --> 00:08:59,675
-And here.

194
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,042
-There's another
one over here too.

195
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:01,908
-And here.

196
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,208
-They're kidding.

197
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,542
-Oh, looks like that
nut job's at it again.

198
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:07,808
Huh?

199
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,508
-Let's just check 'em
out one by one, OK?

200
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:14,075
-What is this place?

201
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:17,542
-Aloha, everybody!

202
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,675
Welcome, my little
keiki, to the big island.

203
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,508
Please, feel right at home
in the friendly Hawaiian

204
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,049
atmosphere.

205
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,975
[growling]

206
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,308
-Ranma!

207
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,375
-Ramna honey's not here.

208
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,375
-What?

209
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,475
-Oh no.

210
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:38,542
We're locked in.

211
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:43,175
-Barber shears?

212
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,542
-Take that, that, and that!

213
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,575
-Please, don't hurt us anymore.

214
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:55,675
-Is that a teacher?

215
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,408
-Those animal sounds
must have been taped.

216
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:58,875
-You could hurt
somebody, you know?

217
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,608
-It was the Principal
who made us.

218
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,642
-Please, I've got three
cubs of my own to feed.

219
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:05,175
-Boohoohoo.

220
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:06,408
-No fair, Principal!

221
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,175
-Yeah, one way or the
other, he's gonna make sure

222
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,308
we get those dumb haircuts.

223
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:13,475
-If we can find that coconut
though, we may not have to.

224
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,742
AKANE (VOICEOVER): That
stupid Ranma, of all the times

225
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:16,275
to disappear.

226
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,217
-Such persistent keiki.

227
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:47,550
If at first you don't
succeed-- How did canoe-- oh?

228
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,984
You kid or girl?

229
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,384
Wahine?

230
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,650
Hey, wahine?

231
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,417
Pigtail?

232
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:56,584
Bowl cuts for girls.

233
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,184
-Alas, I am not your student.

234
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,050
You see, I've been sent from
a neighboring island in search

235
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,817
of a very special coconut.

236
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,984
-You have?

237
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:06,950
What?

238
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,417
It's for your poor,
sickly father?

239
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,784
-That's right.

240
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:12,550
And if he doesn't have a coconut
with a get out of rules free

241
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,784
inside, he may
even-- he may even

242
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,717
come down with a
case of the scurvy!

243
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:17,550
[crying]

244
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,850
-What a dutiful wahine you are.

245
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,584
OK, then.

246
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:22,684
Me will help you.

247
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:24,750
-So then you'll give it to me?

248
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,950
-No, no, wahine.

249
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,317
I mean, me go with
you on journey

250
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,284
to find coconut with get
out of rules free inside.

251
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:30,817
-Huh?

252
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:31,950
Wait a sec.

253
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,784
Are you telling
me don't have it?

254
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,650
-Dumb kahuna me am.

255
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,317
Me forget where me hide it.

256
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,117
-Here it is.

257
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,917
The real Principal's office.

258
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,117
-Be careful.

259
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:44,658
Huh?

260
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:51,950
-Where did these come from?

261
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,117
-The paper could
be in any of 'em.

262
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:57,150
-But we've come too
far to turn back now.

263
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,550
-We're not beat yet.

264
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,091
-Next.

265
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,484
-Hi-yah.

00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:02,532

-Next.

273
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,391

275
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:06,358

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,517
Look at that keiki go.

286
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,250
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Huh,
always doing it the hard way.

287
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,950
-Hi-yah!

288
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,150
-Here's the last one.

289
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,817

Here goes.

292
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:28,340
Hi-yah!

293
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,050
It was a fake.

294
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,617
-Meaning the boys have
gotta get buzzcuts.

295
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,817
-With bowl cuts for girls.

296
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:39,850
-He still hasn't beat us.

297
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,750
If we can just find
where he's hiding.

298
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,850
-She's right.

299
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,617
If he won't give us
the coconut, then we'll

300
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:46,650
just beat it out of him.

301
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,317
-Let's get 'em.

302
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,384
-Principal!

303
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,617
-Too bad this big kahuna
too smart for you.

304
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:57,984
PRINCIPAL: Bad wahine!

305
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,984
You betray me!

306
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,350
-I don't recall ever
teaming up with you.

307
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,684
-Huh?

308
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,317
Was that Ranma's voice I just--

309
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:10,850
-OK, now tell us where
the coconut is, or else.

310
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,917
-Aw, too bad, keiki,
but I no remember.

311
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:15,250
-You don't, huh?

312
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,317
Maybe we can help
refresh your memory.

313
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,784
-So what's it gonna be?

314
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,684
One slab or two?

315
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,817
-OK, now me remember.

316
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:25,584
-Well?

317
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,117
-In the Principal office.

318
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,484
-Which Principal's office?

319
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,717
-Well, that be the one with
t the name on the door.

320
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,050
-You're not leaving till you
tell intelligence us, you know?

321
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,050
-The big kahuna need
a big office, yeah?

322
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,250
Me make different ones
for different days.

323
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,650
-Get to the point.

324
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,784
Which is the one that's got the
coconut with the note inside?

325
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:50,484
[crash]

326
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:53,650
-So why don't you just beat
him and get it over with?

327
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,050
-Inconceivable.

328
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,284
Now hear this, thou foul
obscenity of an administrator.

329
00:13:58,384 --> 00:13:59,950
Not a single hair
is to be trimmed

330
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,750
from Akane Tendo's darling head.

331
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,584
Not while I, Tatewaki
Kuno have breath

332
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,150
in my body to prevent it.

333
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,450
-OK, OK, me no cut!

334
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,617
Me not cut!

335
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,650
You break the rope!

336
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,232
Haha.

337
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,984
-How dare you blow
your vile kisses at me!

338
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:21,566
What?

339
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:28,150
My sword.

340
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,050
-This is the way we stop
swords on the big island.

341
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,750
-You, you may have fooled
me once, but never again.

342
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,184
-Keiki, how about
a nice Hawaiian--

343
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,917
-Why, thank you.

344
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:40,517
-Look out!

345
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:40,999
It's a--

346
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,050
-Moron.

347
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,850
-He's gone.

348
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,084
-He won't get far.

349
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,050
If we check all of
his offices, I'm

350
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,784
sure we'll find him eventually.

351
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:57,784
-OK, we'll split into groups.

352
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:58,984
Ranma, you coming?

353
00:14:59,084 --> 00:14:59,817
-Do I have a choice?

354
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:06,650
Huh?

355
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,350
What the?

356
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,050
-Aloha, keiki!

357
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,384
Feel free to take
the souvenir, yeah.

358
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,484
-How many rooms has he got?

359
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,217
-That plane just
took my top knot!

360
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,850
-Oh, me must be the luckiest
principal in the whole world.

361
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,184
-We'll be running
outta room soon.

362
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,584
Then what?

363
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:44,150
-Ranma.

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,691
-You find him?

365
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,517
-Not yet.

366
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:46,884
It's possible he
could be hiding,

367
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,517
but unless he's in the room Ukyo
and the others are checking,

368
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,017
there's no sign of
him or the coconut.

369
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,950
-Or maybe he's just been
lying to us all along.

370
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,617
-Oh, don't even say that.

371
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:57,484
-Ranma.

372
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:58,250
-Any luck?

373
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,017
-No.

374
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:00,584
We can't find it anywhere.

375
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,450
-That means we're doomed.

376
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,617
-Wait.

377
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,317
I just remembered someplace
we haven't looked.

378
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:05,899
-But where?

379
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:06,399
-Yeah?

380
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:06,884
Where?

381
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:07,717
AKANE: The gym?

382
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,084
UKYO: But just this morning we--

383
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:12,417
RANMA: Exactly, which is why
it's the perfect hiding place.

384
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,650
All this time we've been
concentrating on the offices.

385
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,150
It never occurred to us
to come and look here.

386
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,417
UKYO: You are so smart.

387
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:20,784
RANMA: Let's go get 'em.

388
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,084
-Yeah!

389
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:22,625
-Hm?

390
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:28,550
-Ranma's right.

391
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,050
This has gotta be it.

392
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,250
-Who knows?

393
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,117
Maybe we'll even find the
real Principal's office.

394
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,150
Watch out!

395
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,450
They're after out hair.

396
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,917
-What kinda nut
trains a lobster?

397
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,984
[laughter]

398
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:00,817
-It's the Principal!

399
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,984
-Yo, headmaster from Hell!

400
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:21,350
Where are you?

401
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,117
Huh?

402
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:23,658
Huh?

403
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,650
Well, what do you know?

404
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,350
It looks like
there's nobody home.

405
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,317
-Like I'd really
fall for that one.

406
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,684
Playtime's over, Hula Hair.

407
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,817
Now stop before you
make me really mad.

408
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:42,984
-Why you no let me help you?

409
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,317
Huh, keiki?

410
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,350
Maybe me even remember where
me hide the coconut with the

411
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,584
get out of rules free
note inside, yeah?

412
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,517
-I don't want it anymore.

413
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,250
I don't care if you
are the principal.

414
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,384
You ain't cutting
my hair, got it?

415
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:58,950
And while we're at it, I
think you owe me an apology.

416
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,984
Mind if I beat it out of you?

417
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:01,525
-Wait.

418
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,017
Wait.

419
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:02,550
Let me think.

420
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:05,850
OK.

421
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,117
Me think about it.

422
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,550
What side you want
me to cut first, huh?

423
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,217
-Now where's Ranma gone off to?

424
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,717
Huh?

425
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:17,084
-OK, little pigtail keiki.

426
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,950
Now we're ready for the big fun.

427
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,050
-I call that one, Coconut Crush.

428
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,050
-You did that one on purpose.

429
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,450
-Gee, what do you think?

430
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,484
-Me think, me give you
the pepper balloon.

431
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:42,084
-Boom!

432
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:44,650
-If not for you meddling
keiki, me woulda--

433
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,350
-Yeah, yeah.

434
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,584
Give it up, Principal.

435
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,617
We've got you surrounded.

436
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:49,817
-Phew That was close.

437
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:50,850
-Look.

438
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,450
There's the stupid coconut.

439
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,550
-It's a homer, yeah!

440
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,350
-Why you!

441
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,984
-Vile, evil, wicked,
naughty Principal.

442
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:13,450
Your reign of scholarly
sadism is at an end.

443
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,417
Take this!

444
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:15,417
And this, this, this!

445
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,417
-Hey, watch where
you're hitting.

446
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:18,384
-Ranma?

447
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:21,117
-Hey, I said watch it!

448
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,250
-Hey, look at this.

449
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,884
You wanna get back big
kahunas lucky coconut.

450
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,717
For reward, I be giving
you the buzzcut--

451
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,750
-If it's shaved
heads you want, I'll

452
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,217
be certain to invite Buddhist
monks to your memorial service.

453
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:38,917
-Somebody help me!

454
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:39,450
-Oh no.

455
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,017
No, no, no.

456
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:40,650
Hey, hey, hey.

457
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,484
Get away from me.

458
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,484
-Black justice is at hand!

459
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,950
-You're hitting the wrong guy!

460
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,684
Nah-nah, you missed--

461
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,517
-When you come back, me
give you the buzzcut, yeah.

462
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:57,817
-Think so, huh?

463
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,950
-I've got a big [inaudible]
Me give you Special Aloha

464
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,117
Sword-Shredder technique.

465
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:05,850
-The dreaded Aloha
Sword-Shredder, a technique

466
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,217
from the Pacific Islands
in which an opponent's

467
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:11,250
wooden sword is destroyed
as his hair is sheared?

468
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,450
Amazing.

469
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,817
-But true.

470
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,150
When it be done all proper like,
it be over before it begun.

471
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,517
-Hey, you kno what they say.

472
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:23,050
Everybody's got a plan, until
they get kicked in the head.

473
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,084
-Akane Tendo, I--

474
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,450
-Finally, after
all that trouble.

475
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,717
-You promised, no haircuts
if we could get it.

476
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,784
Remember?

477
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:36,984
-OK, OK.

478
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,017
Me give up, wahine.

479
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,417
You no hold against me, yeah?

480
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:42,750
I only wanted the keiki should
have the big fun at the school

481
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,250
like me do.

482
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,350
Keiki seemed bored, so me
say, big kahuna give them

483
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,117
keiki the big fun, yeah?

484
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,917
[crying]

485
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,817
-I'm touched.

486
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:53,950
-We forgive you.

487
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,850
So don't cry, OK?

488
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,684
-Huh?

489
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,184
What about the pigtail keiki?

490
00:20:58,284 --> 00:20:59,450
Will he forgive me too?

491
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,184
-So what do you say, Ranma?

492
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:04,117
Do you forgive him?

493
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,884
-Malo!

494
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:08,784
Oh me went wrong when me
called you the bad keiki.

495
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:12,917
So now, me give you all
the new present, yeah?

496
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:13,750
Huh?

497
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,350
-Are you ready for the big fun?

498
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,750
-Come back here.

499
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,784
-No, now we have an
all new school rule.

500
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,550
All brothers get them top knots.

501
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,284
Alll sisters get
them geisha cuts.

502
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:30,850
-I ain't going
through this again.

503
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,484
-I still think he
needs a beating.

504
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,650
-Oh Yeah.

505
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,417
RANMA: Come here, I said.

506
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:38,884
PRINCIPAL: As we say on
the big island, Aloha!

507
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:48,232
[ending theme]

508
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,220
AKANE (VOICEOVER): Grandfather
Happousai is training Kuno.

509
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,453
But I wonder.

510
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,253
Are those nasty little
habits he's learning really

511
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,753
gonna make him invincible?

512
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:27,920
Next time on Ranma 1/2, Enter
Kuno, the Night Prowling Night.

513
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,287
We'll see you there.
