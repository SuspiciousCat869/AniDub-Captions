[theme song]

2
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:45,062
That's good.

3
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:45,603
Next.

4
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:50,610
Huh?

5
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,544
[laughing] Akane.

6
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,093
Hmm.

7
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:00,550
Huh?

8
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,993
Hey, it looks like you got
some pretty nice shots here.

9
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,393
Don't mind if I do.

10
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:04,793
Gosunkugi.

11
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:06,193
Yes?

12
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,760
You'll take one for
me, too, won't you?

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,342
Course.

14
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,427
Oh, wow.

15
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:17,360
What the-- don't tell me
you guys like that stuff.

16
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,860
That's just plain weird.

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,593
Yeah, easy for
you to say, seeing

18
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,193
as you already live
together under the same roof

19
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:25,393
and everything.

20
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,727
You'd think you'd be more
sympathetic, you know?

21
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:31,627
Us having to make do with
just pictures, I mean.

22
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,127
And so seeing as all
we do have is pictures,

23
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:38,593
you ought to be more
charitable like.

24
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,127
So tell me, what is
your objection to our

25
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,193
having pictures anyway?

26
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,493
You running a little
monopoly here, or what?

27
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:46,660
Oh, please.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,027
Don't make me laugh, you guys.

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,060
OK then.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,493
So what is it?

31
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:56,260
It's just-- oh, man,
enough with the photos!

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,027
Oh, no you don't.

33
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:57,793
Cut it out!

34
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:00,193
Yo, Gosunkugi, keep going!

35
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:00,734
Sure.

36
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:05,993
You guys, I said cut it out!

37
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:13,934
Huh?

38
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,293
[scream]

39
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,293
Akane!

40
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:19,760
Oh, no!

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm OK.

42
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,593
It's just twisted, I think.

43
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:25,027
See?

44
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:25,660
Akane!

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,660
Someone help.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,427
You two, to the
clinic, quickly.

47
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:30,968
Uh-oh.

48
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:31,527
Busted.

49
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:33,427
Yeah, I'll say.

50
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,327
RANMA (VOICEOVER): Akane
Goes to the Hospital.

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,393
OK, let's have a look.

52
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:42,593
[whimpering]

53
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:45,560
I hate to tell you this,
but it may be broken.

54
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,793
We'd better have a
specialist look at it.

55
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,227
Actually, I think I
know just the place.

56
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:53,593
It's a clinic near here.

57
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,427
[interposing voices]

58
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,493
How is she?

59
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,827
Well, she's been admitted
to the Ono clinic.

60
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,527
They think her leg
might be broken.

61
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,493
[interposing voices]

62
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,093
It wouldn't have happened
if it wasn't for you guys!

63
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:08,893
Yeah!

64
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:09,627
Now wait.

65
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:10,927
It's not like I--

66
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,460
You what?

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,160
Had nothing to do with it?

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,527
I didn't mean--

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,860
Hmm.

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,093
Well, the good news
is it's not broken.

71
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:26,860
But there's
definitely a fracture.

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,427
Luckily, it's nothing a
little bed rest won't fix.

73
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,193
So that means that I--

74
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,060
Will be here two,
three days, at least.

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,060
Well, if it can't be helped.

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,360
Akane!

77
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,593
Akane!

78
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,027
Hey, sis.

79
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:48,793
Promise me you won't die.

80
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:51,193
You look pretty good
for being half dead.

81
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:54,660
Wow, it's pretty rare that
you cause a scare, Akane.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,060
I'd like to keep
her two, three days.

83
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,027
You know, just to keep
an eye on her recovery.

84
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,793
Huh?

85
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,027
Doctor!

86
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,927
I'm counting on you to save
my darling little girl.

87
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:06,193
OK.

88
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:07,693
Here you are.

89
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,527
K-Kasumi!

90
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:12,593
So, how are you feeling, Akane?

91
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:14,560
Good, thanks.

92
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,493
Clumsy me.

93
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:18,260
I'd love to stay
and help nurse,

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
if that's all right
with you, Dr. Tofu.

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,927
R-r-r-right!

96
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,460
Of course it's all right!

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,427
More than of course!

98
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,193
[nervous laughter]

99
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,293
Um, doctor?

100
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,427
K-Kasumi!

101
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,560
Perhaps you'd best let
Dr. Tofu handle this.

102
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,993
She-- she may heal faster,
if you see what I mean.

103
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:36,993
Oh.

104
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,427
Well, doctor, in
that case, I'll, uh--

105
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,460
L-leave it to me, Kasumi.

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,460
Huh?

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,460
[sigh]

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,660
What's the sigh for?

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,201
N-nothing.

110
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:53,660
He's still at school, if
it's Ranma you're thinking of.

111
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,927
Speaking of whom,
where is that boy?

112
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:59,293
His own fiancee in
the hospital and all.

113
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,027
Oh, it's OK, really.

114
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:01,627
I--

115
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,760
He's an idiot.

116
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,593
He ought to have been
the first at your side.

117
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,760
Must I tell him everything?

118
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,760
Gee, she didn't
look that bad to me.

119
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,493
I'll come back later
once they're gone.

120
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:13,593
You need your rest, Akane.

121
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:14,760
So--

122
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,760
Take care of her for
us, will you, Dr. Tofu?

123
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,360
Well, sure.

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:18,893
I--

125
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:19,334
[crash]

126
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:19,801
Ow!

127
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:20,401
Ow.

128
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,768
Oh!

129
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:25,168
W-well then, Akane, I'll
come and check on you later.

130
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:25,709
OK.

131
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:32,150
Idiot.

132
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,001
RANMA (VOICEOVER): She's
gonna be mad, I just know it.

133
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,168
I guess I'd better
go and apologize.

134
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,868
[knocking]

135
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,334
Come in.

136
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:48,101
Oh, Ranma!

137
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:48,901
Hey.

138
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,934
How's the leg doing, Akane?

139
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,834
Well, Dr. Tofu says
it's not too bad.

140
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:54,734
I'm so sorry.

141
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:55,434
I--

142
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:56,501
It's OK, Ranma.

143
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,434
I was careless is all.

144
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,268
It's no one's fault.

145
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,401
Glad you're not mad.

146
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,834
I'm still sorry it happened.

147
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:07,434
But Ranma, I'm
wondering, how did it even

148
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:08,668
happen in the first place?

149
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:09,901
Oh.

150
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,901
Well, you know, that
stupid Gosunkugi

151
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:16,968
was sort of taking pictures and
all, and I kind of, you know--

152
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,568
Uh, don't-- don't get me wrong!

153
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:27,068
I don't want you to think-- I
mean, I'm not jealous, I just--

154
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,168
You just?

155
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:32,068
It's just, I, uh--

156
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,701
It's just, you--

157
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,568
I just--

158
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,534
Whoa, no!

159
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:41,868
OK, maybe if I
weren't so serious.

160
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:42,409
[knocking]

161
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:43,968
Come in.

162
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,801
RANMA (VOICEOVER):
Real casual like.

163
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:47,568
Hiya!

164
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,434
Gosh, you're looking good.

165
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,368
Sorry about before.

166
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,801
It's OK, Ranma.

167
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,468
I was careless is all.

168
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,934
It's no one's fault.

169
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,501
Well, hey, I'm just
glad to see that you

170
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,034
weren't more seriously hurt.

171
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,868
Thank you, Ranma.

172
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,534
Your not being able to let
someone else take pictures?

173
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,368
Well, it's practically
the same as your saying

174
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,434
that-- well, you love me.

175
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:10,975
Wha--?

176
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,268
I

177
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:16,034
Just knowing you said that--
well, it's practically worth

178
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,434
breaking my leg for.

179
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,268
Akane!

180
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,434
[scream]

181
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,134
Man, I'm doomed either way.

182
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:31,834
No matter what I say, it's
going to look like I-- oh, jeez!

183
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:32,434
I-- huh?

184
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,034
That's strange.

185
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:38,101
Hmm.

186
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,634
You stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid jerk!

187
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,934
Huh?

188
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:46,534
Come-- come in!

189
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:47,401
Here you go.

190
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,468
I brought you dinner, Akane.

191
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:50,634
I'll bet you're hungry.

192
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:54,968
[laughter] I sure am.

193
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,268
Wow, you made this?

194
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,834
Looks great.

195
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:58,601
Doesn't it?

196
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,901
Not too bad, huh?

197
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,334
Mmm, it tastes good.

198
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,168
Curse you, Ranma Saotome!

199
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:23,401
Because of you, Akane
is-- it's your fault!

200
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,401
Your fault!

201
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,834
Your fault!

202
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:26,375
Yours!

203
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:27,301
Curse you!

204
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,168
[sneeze]

205
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,168
[knocking]

206
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:39,709
Hmm?

207
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:41,501
Yes?

208
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:42,501
Hi, Akane!

209
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,268
We've come to visit you.

210
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,101
You look great.

211
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:49,101
This is from all
of us at school.

212
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,801
I think there's a
card inside, too.

213
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:54,868
Are you two coming or not?

214
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,634
You got hurt because of us.

215
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,368
We're sorry.

216
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,534
Well, this isn't much, but--

217
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,801
Thanks.

218
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,634
I hope you won't worry about me.

219
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:04,568
I'm fine.

220
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,968
And besides, it
was all my fault.

221
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:07,868
Well--

222
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:09,534
Thank you.

223
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:12,534
So Akane, did Ranma ever show?

224
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,668
He took off after class
today, and I guess

225
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,201
I figured he'd be here, but--

226
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,001
Sayuri!

227
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:20,542
Huh?

228
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,934
Mm-mm.

229
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:26,568
Oh, I'm-- I'm sure
he'll come eventually.

230
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,001
[nervous laughter]

231
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,768
Akane Tendo, fear no more!

232
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:34,734
With this special
appointment, I, Tatewaki Kuno,

233
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,634
will have you on your
feet in no time at all.

234
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:40,668
Oh, hey So you guys.

235
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:43,734
And here's a gift for you
from Mistress Kodachi, which

236
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,101
she asked me to bring you.

237
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,134
What's going on?

238
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:50,401
[screaming]

239
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,234
[laughter]

240
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:01,968
Akane, hi!

241
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:03,301
I heard you were injured.

242
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,534
Are you OK?

243
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,934
Remember, if Ranma's too
much for you, I can always--

244
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,201
Nihao!

245
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:09,768
Look, Akane!

246
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,068
Special ramen!

247
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,301
Shampoo bring you more, too,
every day you in hospital!

248
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:16,301
One year, two year, three year!

249
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:20,668
Uh, gee, thanks.

250
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:21,601
Hello, Akane.

251
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:22,501
[scream]

252
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:23,701
What in the world?

253
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,434
[coughing] Here.

254
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:28,934
Vitamin drink.

255
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:33,134
I use it all the time.

256
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,468
[siren]

257
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,401
What was that all about?

258
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:40,901
Collapsing on a sick call?

259
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,468
Jeez.

260
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:44,968
Hello, everyone.

261
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:47,634
It's so nice you've
come to visit.

262
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,568
I do hope you'll
let me thank you.

263
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,034
I've made dinner for
everyone back at the house.

264
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,668
[interposing voices]

265
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,901
See you later, Akane.

266
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,634
Oh, I hope I made enough.

267
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:41,784
[laughter]

268
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:42,617
[interposing voices]

269
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:52,851
We are!

270
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:53,717
We're next!

271
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:54,384
Come on, Sayuri!

272
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:55,084
Come on!

273
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,551
One, two, three, four!

274
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,517
(SINGING) Ya pa pa, ya pa
pa, don't know what to do.

275
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:03,117
My heart is not a game,
it's mahjong to you.

276
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:08,651
Ya pa pa, ya pa pa, feel like
such a shrew. [inaudible].

277
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,384
Ranma?

278
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,517
Can I talk to you a sec?

279
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:20,151
I hate to ask, it being the
middle of the party and all,

280
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,417
but would you mind
bringing this to Akane?

281
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:25,484
It would really be a big help.

282
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,484
Sure thing.

283
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,817
I'm on my way.

284
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,751
Thank you so much.

285
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,351
[meowing]

286
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,117
Hmm?

287
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,658
C-c-cats?

288
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,051
Apparently Ranma's
on his way over.

289
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,184
He's bringing a change
of clothes for you.

290
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,651
Oh, he is?

291
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,717
He should be here any moment.

292
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,217
And if he should decide to
come through the window,

293
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,084
he needn't say hello to me.

294
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:56,951
Huh?

295
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,584
Tell him, won't you?

296
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,851
See you tomorrow.

297
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:01,984
G-good night.

298
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,684
[gasp]

299
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,951
Hey.

300
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,151
Ranma?

301
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,417
K-Kasumi asked me to, uh,
bring you some clothes.

302
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,084
So I, uh--

303
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:20,884
She did?

304
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,084
Thank you.

305
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,684
Well, I'm-- I'm happy
to do it, actually.

306
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,984
So how's the leg?

307
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,717
Uh-- stay where you are!

308
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,184
Don't come any closer!

309
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,584
I see.

310
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,584
So that's how it's
going to be, huh?

311
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,917
Well, excuse me!

312
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,051
Next time Gosunkugi
starts taking

313
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,584
his pervy little pictures of
stupid, clumsy little you,

314
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:42,551
I'll let him!

315
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,917
How's that?

316
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,151
You jerk!

317
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,951
Just leave, will you?

318
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,617
You don't gotta tell me twice!

319
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:51,184
Thanks for nothing!

320
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:53,484
Huh?

321
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,025
Hmm.

322
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,451
Good morning, Doctor Tofu.

323
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,017
How are you?

324
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,517
Good morning, Akane.

325
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,717
So tell me, did we have
a visitor last night?

326
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,084
Uh-huh.

327
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,517
Through the window.

328
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:18,617
Yep, that's pretty
much what I thought.

329
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,917
Dr. Tofu, I was wondering,
do you always train this hard?

330
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,551
Hey, setting bones is
hard work, you know.

331
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:28,484
I need to keep up my strength.

332
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:37,617
Come to think of it, so do I.

333
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,184
I-- I made it!

334
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:45,651
I've been to every hospital in
town, but finally, I'm here!

335
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:49,017
[oinking]

336
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,351
Huh?

337
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,584
P-chan!

338
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,151
You came to see me.

339
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,984
I'm so happy!

340
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:01,051
So, who's in the
mood for breakfast?

341
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,251
What do little pigs like to eat?

342
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,817
That was so good.

343
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,517
You're very welcome.

344
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:12,351
Oh, that reminds me, I found
some childhood pictures of you.

345
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,451
You want to see them?

346
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:17,584
Wow, may I?

347
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,051
[oinking]

348
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:34,517
Oh my goodness, is this you?

349
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:42,884
I can hardly believe how
cute you were back then!

350
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,551
And I'm not anymore?

351
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:48,484
You know what I-- huh?

352
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,851
Huh?

353
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,017
Pictures of Kasumi!

354
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:56,717
And here's some more, and more?

355
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:00,951
You weren't supposed
to see those!

356
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,584
Oh, doctor!

357
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,084
Please, Akane!

358
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,517
Please don't tell Kasumi, OK?

359
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:06,217
OK?

360
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,284
Don't tell her, please?

361
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:08,051
Pretty please?

362
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,084
[laughing] OK.

363
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,917
I won't.

364
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:14,017
I'll just go put the
closet in the album, OK?

365
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,051
I mean, the album in the closet.

366
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:27,117
--[laughing] Pictures
of the one you love.

[trumpet music]

369
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,451
What, are you guys
gonna party again?

370
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,284
Yeah.

371
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,151
It's rude to impose, you know.

372
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,417
And what is that
you've got there?

373
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,851
Best karaoke hits collection.

374
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:52,217
We've got a whole routine
all worked out, don't we?

375
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,984
What a bunch of hypocrites.

376
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,884
Until Akane's discharged,
we'll keep it up, too.

377
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,551
Yeah!

378
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:00,817
How's this pose, Akane?

379
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:01,717
Huh?

380
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:02,584
Oh, yeah.

381
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,417
No no no, like this.

382
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,617
Oh, what do you know?

383
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:09,984
[laughter]

384
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:11,884
You stink!

385
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,617
Get off the stage!

386

[interposing voices]

00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:20,917
Hi-yah!

388
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,084
No fair, Shampoo!

389
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:22,984
You cheated!

390
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,751
Of course I cheat.

391
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,651
Why you--

392
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,051
[phone ringing]

393
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:35,117
Can't somebody get the phone?

394
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:35,651
Hello?

395
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,684
Tendo Dojo?

396
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,417
AKANE (ON PHONE): Uh, hi.

397
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,317
It's Akane.

398
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:44,684
Look, I'm getting out a day
early, so I thought I call.

399
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:46,917
Well, I'll-- I'll--
I'll go get your dad, OK?

400
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,017
Just stay on the line.

401
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,184
AKANE (ON PHONE): No, don't!

402
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,817
Uh, that's all.

403
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,484
Good night.

404
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,451
I-- uh.

405
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:03,317

[snoring]

408
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:32,951
Done, just in time.

409
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,284
But then again,
if I don't hurry--

410
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,284
[grunting]

411
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:44,484
That's it.

412
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,317
Careful.

413
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:46,858
OK.

414
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,758
Congratulations
on your release.

415
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,025
If there's no one
else, I can always

416
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,425
help you make your
way back home.

417
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,658
Oh, thanks for the offer, but
I can probably make it, though.

418
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,292
I'll be fine.

419
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:02,492
Now that's the Akane I know.

420
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,825
Stubborn right to the last.

421
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,992
Although I think
you've got a helper.

422
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:08,558
See?

423
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:09,099
What?

424
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,899
Akane?

425
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:14,440
Ranma?

[squealing]

427
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:27,640
Easy, now.

428
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,807
Let's just watch them, shall we?

429
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:33,574
Did you do that?

430
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:34,940
Uh-huh.

431
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,374
And I've also got--

432
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:37,307
What?

433
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:38,740
Hey, that's when--

434
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,074
Came out pretty good, huh?

435
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,440
Oh, wow.

436
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,974
So you've had it all this time?

437
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:48,107
Well-- well, yeah,
but not because I--

438
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,440
Aww, ain't that sweet?

439
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,007
I messed up, he says.

440
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:54,240
I'm so embarrassed.

441
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,074
Now we look stupid.

442
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,774
No kidding.

443
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,207
Way to go!

444
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,807
Would that I were so loved.

445
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,074
What meaning of this?

446
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,607
I swear, the minute
your back's turned.

447
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,707
Never fear, Kuno is here!

448
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,974
Oh, no you don't!

449
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,107
Come on!

450
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:11,440
They're getting away!

451
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,774
Somebody, quick, after them!

452
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,240
No way we're staying for that.

453
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,774
Hang on tight!

454
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:20,207
OK.

455
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:22,940
Hey, what's that?

456
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,907
Don't-- don't do that!

457
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:25,807
Hey, hey, cut it out!

458
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,774
I can't see!
