[theme music]

2
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,887
What a blizzard.

3
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,321
I guess I'll get some
shut-eye until it blows over.

4
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,687
What a beautiful day.

5
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,754
Akane, I wish you were here
to enjoy this glorious morning

6
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,554
with me.

7
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:10,954
Wait, enjoy the
morning together?

8
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,687
Hey, Akane!

9
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,121
I miss you!

10
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:21,728
Oh, no!

11
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:27,162
What?

12
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,721
This is too weird.

13
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:39,262
Huh?

14
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,228
Huh?

15
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:53,828
What's this?

16
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,754
Ah!

17
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,687
Ah!

18
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:11,987

NARRATOR: A Cold
Day In Furinkan.

20
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,321
[nervous laughter]

21
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,421
Pretty cold, huh?

22
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,787
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:32,621
You must be cold.

24
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,354
How about a cup of tea?

25
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:36,121
Here.

26
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,887
It will warn you right up.

27
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,254
Thanks a lot.

28
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:42,054
Oh-- by the way, Ranma, thanks
for shoveling the sidewalk.

29
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,187
What?

30
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,254
You mean he actually did
something around here?

31
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:47,854
Oh, Nibiki, leave him alone.

32
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,354
Thank you.

33
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,954
I bet that's the first time
you've ever helped doing chores

34
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:52,987
around here.

35
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,321
No way.

36
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:57,221
Akane, where are your manners?

37
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,721
OK, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,754
The second time
you've done something.

39
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:03,387
Looks like it was
a record snowfall.

40
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:06,621
It's from some freaky
weather system, or something.

41
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:12,221
Well, whatever kind of system
it was, I kind of like it.

42
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,321
Hm?

43
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,521
Hey, pop, why don't
you get off your butt,

44
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,554
and come and help me shovel?

45
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,621
Or are you going to sit inside
all day like a lazy old cat?

46
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,354
Go away.

47
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:22,187
Man.

48
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:24,421
And they were calling me lazy.

49
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,487
I am a cat.

50
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,921
I don't care if I'm
lazy and lie around.

51
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:29,021
Why, you--

52
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,454
[meowing]

53
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:32,787
Get away!

54
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,954
[shouting]

55
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:46,362
Akane--

56
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,354
RANMA: I wonder what
he was doing out there.

57
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:06,154
AKANE: Luckily we found him
before he froze to death.

58
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:08,954
Poor thing.

59
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,087
I don't think it was
just the cold weather that

60
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,787
made him this week.

61
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,387
I don't understand
what you mean, Ranma.

62
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:18,687
Well, once he snaps out
of it, we'll ask him.

63
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,187
No!

64
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:24,054
It's some kind of big,
snow covered monster!

65
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:25,054
RANMA: Come on, Ryoga.

66
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:26,821
Try to remember everything.

67
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:27,587
AKANE: No!

68
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:30,254
Ranma, he needs his rest.

69
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,487
Looks like the big
wimp's asleep again.

70
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,087
Just leave him
alone, all right?

71
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:35,421
Oh, my.

72
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,154
What is this?

73
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,754
A flute?

74
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:41,387
[gasp] It's so cold.

75
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,287
Take a look at this.

76
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,754
Hey, Ranma, do
you have any ideas

77
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,487
on what scared Ryoga so much?

78
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,854
I haven't got a clue.

79
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,654
That's why I came here to see.

80
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:05,821
[screaming] Oh, man!

81
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,787
The snow is frozen solid!

82
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,887
Ranma, are you OK?

83
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:11,687
Oh, no!

84
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,787
Ranma, look where you are!

85
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:14,654
Ranma!

86
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:15,195
Huh?

87
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,421
I don't believe it.

88
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,621
What do you think made this?

89
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:25,987
Dunno.

90
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,421
Maybe it's the same thing that
Ryoga was babbling on about.

91
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,821
You think?

92
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:32,362
Huh?

93
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,721
There's someone there.

94
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,487
AKANE: Be careful.

95
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,387
She doesn't look like
she's from around here.

96
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,354
Is she breathing?

97
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:54,254
Ranma, her forehead
feels as cold as ice.

98
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,587
We've got to get
her home right away!

99
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:58,221
I'm on it.

100
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,187
[shivering]

101
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,754
Cold.

102
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,854
I feel if we went
into the freezer,

103
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,287
it would be warmer in there.

104
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:21,021
What happened to the
heat in this house?

105
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,387
When is the tea
going to be ready?

106
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,121
I don't know.

107
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,521
The water's still cold.

108
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,787
It's been on the stove
for an hour already.

109
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:29,787
Forget the tea.

110
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,987
I guess I'll just
have a hot bath.

111
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,754
Nibiki, after Ranma
comes out of the bathtub,

112
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,221
then it's your turn.

113
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,554
[shriek]

114
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:42,921
There's not a drop of hot
water left in this place.

115
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,987
What?

116
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,521
But that can't be, because
before you came home,

117
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,354
we had plenty of hot water.

118
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:52,521
Maybe with all
this cold weather,

119
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,321
the hot water heater's broken?

120
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,721
Impossible.

121
00:07:55,821 --> 00:08:00,621
All we wanted was a nice
cup of hot tea, eh, Saotome?

122
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,921
You know, Tendo,
it will be a sad day

123
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,487
when they discover our frozen
remains in this big, old house.

124
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,954
That's not very funny.

125
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,354
Don't say things
like that, Saotome.

126
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:10,895
Understand?

127
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,987
Man, Ryoga still
hasn't woken up.

128
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,421
He's been asleep all day.

129
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:21,621
And so has the girl you
brought in this afternoon.

130
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,487
Yeah, and Akane
hasn't left her side.

131
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:28,821
Hello.

132
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,554
Do you feel well
enough to speak?

133
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:34,354
Where did you come from,
and what's your name?

134
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:35,454
Were you alone?

135
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,821
You should sleep.

136
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:39,254
Hm?

137
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,521
Hey, Akane.

138
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,987
So, uh, was our little
friend well enough

139
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,021
to fill you in on who she is?

140
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,921
Excuse me, but how is he?

141
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:51,487
She's coming to!

142
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:54,987
Tell me, how is he doing?

143
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,187
Last time I checked,
he was still breathing.

144
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,554
AKANE: Don't you
worry about him.

145
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,354
He's getting stronger
every minute.

146
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:06,154
Now, why don't you
try and get some rest?

147
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,587
Nu is here.

148
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:08,954
Huh?

149
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:10,654
Nu has come for me.

150
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,454
Who's this Nu?

151
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:15,487
If we run away from him, he
will make our entire village

152
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,654
freeze, and everyone will die.

153
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:18,987
Man.

154
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,487
So it's this Nu guy that's
responsible for all the snow.

155
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:24,054
Maybe those footprints
we saw were his.

156
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:27,887
And I'll bet that's who
Ryoga met up with last night.

157
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,454
What are we going to do?

158
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,787
I'm going to have to beat
him, or this whole city's

159
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,221
going to be an ice cube.

160
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,487
You stay put.

161
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,421
I've got some
frozen butt to kick.

162
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,787
Oh, no.

163
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,887
Where am I?

164
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,121
Who-- who's there?

165
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:50,495
Huh?

166
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,583
[screaming]

167
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,699
Who are you?

168
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:09,187
Oh, my.

169
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:31,754
Hey!

170
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:33,721
Have you seen him?

171
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,354
AKANE: No!

172
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,621
Aw, man!

173
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,187
Trying to track this big
blockhead through the snow

174
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:41,254
is a whole lot harder
than I thought.

175
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:42,487
AKANE: Ranma!

176
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:43,954
Huh?

177
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:44,821
What's up?

178
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:46,521
Did you find fresh tracks?

179
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:47,054
Look there!

180
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:47,954
What the--

181
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:52,954
Do you think--

182
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:53,954
Yeah.

183
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,687
That's where Nu lives.

184
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:15,521
Man, this place is so huge.

185
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,987
Akane, you go home and
tell Pops about this place.

186
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,487
You're not going in there?

187
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,087
Yeah.

188
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:22,687
That is crazy.

189
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:23,854
Face it.

190
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,421
If you come with me,
you'll only slow me down.

191
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,121
You jerk!

192
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,154
Well, yeah, I guess someone has
to go back and tell the others.

193
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,754
Hey, Akane-- thank you.

194
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,154
[shivering]

195
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,454
I'm freezing.

196
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,154
Well, I'm frozen.

197
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,154
I've never been
this cold before.

198
00:11:57,254 --> 00:12:01,187
I wonder if Akane and
Ranma are all right?

199
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,521
Ryoga, you're awake.

200
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,221
Are you well enough
to be walking around?

201
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:06,521
Sure.

202
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:09,321
By the way, who's that girl
sleeping in the bedroom?

203
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:12,187
Ranma found her
lying out in the snow.

204
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:12,754
Well?

205
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:14,054
Do you know her?

206
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:15,887
I've ever seen her before.

207
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,654
So where's Ranma and Akane?

208
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,421
Uh-- uh, they said they were
going out to find somebody

209
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,254
named Nu, or something.

210
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:22,795
Huh?

211
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:23,295
Nu?

212
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:32,862
Hm?

213
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:44,787
This is amazing.

214
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:50,754
What the-- who's there?

215
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,754
[groaning]

216
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,287
Abominable snowman?

217
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,121
You can't be serious.

218
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,221
Yes.

219
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,887
That's what I remember.

220
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:04,187
So, the tales we heard as
boys about such a creature

221
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,454
are true, then.

222
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:09,087
Ryoga, are you saying this
snowman is here right now?

223
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:12,521
Not only is he here, but
he seems to be pretty angry.

224
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:15,154
I tried to fend him off with
my Breaking Point technique,

225
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,721
but he moves so quickly,
he didn't even notice me.

226
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:18,821
What?

227
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:21,254
I thought that technique
was your best move.

228
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,454
Would you care
to explain, Ryoga?

229
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,654
[groaning]

230
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:28,321
Hey!

231
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,621
What are you doing?

232
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,054
He's trying to freeze
the whole town!

233
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,521
Think again, pal!

234
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:46,062
Hi-yah!

235
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,987
Oh, man.

236
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:54,954
Think you're tough?

237
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:55,495
What the--

238
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:04,087
He's made out of snow, and he
can separate and bring himself

239
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,921
back together again in a flash.

240
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:09,287
You know, you're probably
lucky just to be alive, Ryoga.

241
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,721
Oh, my.

242
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:11,854
Hm.

243
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:13,754
And that might explain
why your Breaking Point

244
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,621
didn't have any effect on him.

245
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,187
That's right.

246
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,421
[screaming]

247
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,887
Dad!

248
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:28,754
Everyone!

249
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:29,587
You've gotta help!

250
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,487
Ranma went in the cave alone!

251
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,554
What cave?

252
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,021
What are you talking about?

253
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,087
The snowman's cave!

254
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:39,421
You mean Ranma's trying to
fight the battle all by himself?

255
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,254
Akane, you've got to
take me to him right now.

256
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:45,221
But are you sure you're
feeling strong enough, Ryoga?

257
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,187
Hey, don't worry about me.

258
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,421
It's Ranma who's in danger.

259
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,121
What?

260
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,587
How do you mean, Ryoga?

261
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:52,787
I've heard enough.

262
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:56,254
It's time we see this
monster for ourselves.

263
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,987
I'm ready for a fight.

264
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:02,587
Akane, you've got to show me
where this cave is, and fast.

265
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:03,921
Right.

266
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:07,021
It's still cold out there,
so you'd better take my coat.

267
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,554
KASUMI: Akane, are
you warm enough?

268
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:10,054
I'll be fine, Kasumi.

269
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,787
Now, where did I
put those snow shoes?

270
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,254
KASUMI: Look in
the closet, Father.

271
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:42,454
Aw, man.

272
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:45,821
I can't even get close to him.

273
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,187
Ryoga, are you sure
you're all right?

274
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:50,254
Right now the last
thing I'm concerned about

275
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,187
is myself, Akane.

276
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,754
You've got to try
and understand,

277
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,954
it's Ranma I'm worried
about, because there's

278
00:15:56,054 --> 00:16:00,154
no way I'd let him get beat up
by anyone else other than me.

279
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:00,954
Ryoga--

280
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:01,821
We've got to hurry.

281
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,254
Oh, Father--

282
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,221
What is it?

283
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,187
What?

284
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,354
I've looked through
the whole house,

285
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,221
and that girl seems to be gone.

286
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,954
What do you mean?

287
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,254
Why would she
just up and leave?

288
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:18,954
I checked outside, Kasumi,
but there's no sign of her.

289
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:22,387
KASUMI: Oh, I hope she didn't
go out in this weather.

290
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:23,487
Hm.

291
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:25,287
We'll have to let Ryoga
take care of Ranma.

292
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:28,121
Saotome, you and I will search
every square inch of this city

293
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,454
until we find her.

294
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,187
Good idea.

295
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:35,195
Huh?

296
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:40,587
Oh, my.

297
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:48,521
Right there!

298
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:49,521
That's it!

299
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,987
Can you see it?

300
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,487
Ryoga?

301
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:54,954
Where are you?

302
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:55,495
Ryoga!

303
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,854
Can you hear me, Akane?

304
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,321
Huh?

305
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,187
Akane!

306
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:14,754
No.

307
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,021
That's not her.

308
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,021
But who is it?

309
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,121
Hey-- hey, wait.

310
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:19,987
Don't run away!

311
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,187
It's only me!

312
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,954
Now, where did that girl go?

313
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,554
This must be it.

314
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,287
Oh, no.

315
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,921
Half my muscles are
starting to freeze up on me.

316
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:41,521
RYOGA: Ranma!

317
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,121
Hey, Ryoga.

318
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,087
You idiot!

319
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:49,087
You could have been
killed in there!

320
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:50,354
Listen to me.

321
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,687
I think I might have found
out what his weakness is.

322
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,087
Weakness?

323
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:57,387
Even when he scatters himself,
his eye always stays the same.

324
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:58,854
It's his eye!

325
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,821
Look out!

326
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:03,321
Aim at his eye, Ryoga!

327
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,287
Bakusai Tenketsu!

328
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:19,721
Are you all right, Ranma?

329
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:22,287
I'm just fine, Ryoga.

330
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,054
Huh?

331
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,087
Oh, no!

332
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,854
We've gotta get out
of here, and fast!

333
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,521
That was close.

334
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,121
Man, you're not kidding.

335
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,521
Well, it's over.

336
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:46,254
AKANE: Ranma!

337
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,087
Ryoga!

338
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,854
Oh!

339
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:53,221
You don't know how worried
I've been abour you two!

340
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:53,921
Oh, Akane.

341
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,054
That is so sweet of you.

342
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:59,121
When I left you at the cave
and went back home for help,

343
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,121
I was scared.

344
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,021
Hey, I can take care of myself.

345
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,521
Huh?

346
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,021
Hm?

347
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:05,562
Hey, look!

348
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,987
That thing is still alive!

349
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,721
Ranma, wait!

350
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,121
What for?

351
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,987
Look.

352
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:21,387
The evil has gone out of him.

353
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,854
I am so sorry.

354
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,654
When I left my village to
come down from the mountains,

355
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:29,187
Nu followed along to
protect me from any harm,

356
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:33,454
and to make sure I didn't lose
my way in a strange new land.

357
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,454
And when you took
me to your home,

358
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,121
he must have thought you
were going to hurt me.

359
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,121
Hurt you?

360
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,921
Who are you, anyway?

361
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:43,054
I feel just awful
about everything

362
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,087
that has happened to you.

363
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,854
It's all my fault.

364
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,587
Can you ever forgive me?

365
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,754
RYOGA: She's freezing.

366
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:52,721
Hey, look!

367
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,421
And you, my prince.

368
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,754
You were the one who
found my precious flute

369
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,587
and returned it to me.

370
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:07,421
Now I must go.

371
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,287
Wait--

372
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:12,721
For the people of my
village will be worried,

373
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:16,821
but I pray that one day soon we
will all see each other again.

374
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,287
No, don't!

375
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:19,721
I must.

376
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:20,954
Remember this, though.

377
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,721
I will never forget the
kindness you have shown me.

378
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,254
And for this I am
truly thankful.

379
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:28,787
So until we meet
again, farewell.

380
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,954
She disappeared.

381
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,787
She was a snow woman.

382
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,354
She was just like him.

383
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,854
And her tears--

384
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,954
What about them?

385
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:53,087
Her tears-- they were warm.

386
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,554
AKANE: Hey, look, guys.

387
00:20:57,654 --> 00:20:59,554
The sky's starting to clear up.

388
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:15,387
Well, I guess it looks like
everything's getting back

389
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:16,387
to normal again, huh?

390
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:24,287
Hey, Ryoga, do you think
she-- maybe, you know?

391
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:24,828
Maybe.

00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,321

394
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:19,088
NARRATOR: Everyone has the
right to fall in love, even

395
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:22,222
if you're a scribbled panda
inside a magical wall scroll.

396
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:25,655
Next time on Ranma 1/2,
Curse of the Scribbled Panda.

397
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,822
We'll see ya there.
